                Situation 12, first play
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  4 2014</time>
              <p>Game with Al S. as Russians, myself as Germans.</p>
              
              <p>Germans deployed mines across Board 2 to disrupt lines of
              transportation, then positioned the heavy artillery on Board 1 in deep
              cover. Three command posts make spotting fairly easy, and the big field
              guns were able to combine fire to destroy Russian infantry.</p>
              
              <p>The Russians bunched up on the north edge of Board 3, and were unable to
              make any serious penetration onto Board 2 until after the half way mark
              in the game.</p>
              
              <p>German win.</p>
              
              <h2 id="after-action-report">After Action Report</h2>
              
              <p>Probably should have put the command post truck along the Bednost road
              instead of behind Hill 132. This would let me put the artillery into
              action 1 turn earlier. Maybe even have 1 or 2 cps deployed at beginning
              of game instead of being loaded on trucks.</p>
              
              <p>I deployed mines at the bridge on the road between Golid and Bednost.
              This was probably a bad idea as it limits my ability to move units
              (e.g., command posts) north to south.</p>
              
              <h3 id="situation-12-handicapping-and-balance">Situation #12 handicapping and balance</h3>
              
              <p>Situation #12 is one of the few where the Russians really have a hard
              way to go. Some ways to better balance the scenario include:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>decrease the number of mines and blocks for the Germans.</li>
                <li>decrease the number of Wespe and Hummel available to the Germans.</li>
                <li>Increase the game length by 2 or even 5 turns.</li>
                <li>allow each command post to call fire for only one unit per turn.</li>
              </ul>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Something new: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last few years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something classic: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something again: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something Vietnam as I'm on a Vietnam binge.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air ware in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
