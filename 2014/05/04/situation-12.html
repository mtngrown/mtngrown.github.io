<p>Game with Al S. as Russians, myself as Germans.</p>

<p>Germans deployed mines across Board 2 to disrupt lines of
transportation, then positioned the heavy artillery on Board 1 in deep
cover. Three command posts make spotting fairly easy, and the big field
guns were able to combine fire to destroy Russian infantry.</p>

<p>The Russians bunched up on the north edge of Board 3, and were unable to
make any serious penetration onto Board 2 until after the half way mark
in the game.</p>

<p>German win.</p>

<h2 id="after-action-report">After Action Report</h2>

<p>Probably should have put the command post truck along the Bednost road
instead of behind Hill 132. This would let me put the artillery into
action 1 turn earlier. Maybe even have 1 or 2 cps deployed at beginning
of game instead of being loaded on trucks.</p>

<p>I deployed mines at the bridge on the road between Golid and Bednost.
This was probably a bad idea as it limits my ability to move units
(e.g., command posts) north to south.</p>

<h3 id="situation-12-handicapping-and-balance">Situation #12 handicapping and balance</h3>

<p>Situation #12 is one of the few where the Russians really have a hard
way to go. Some ways to better balance the scenario include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decrease the number of mines and blocks for the Germans.</li>
  <li>decrease the number of Wespe and Hummel available to the Germans.</li>
  <li>Increase the game length by 2 or even 5 turns.</li>
  <li>allow each command post to call fire for only one unit per turn.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
