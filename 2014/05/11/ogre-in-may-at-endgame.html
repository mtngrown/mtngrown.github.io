Ogre In May at Endgame
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 11 2014</time>
<p>This is a report on the May 10th Ogre meetup at Endgame. It turns out
only Dave M. and myself showed up for this, with a brief appearance from
Caleb, who was suffering from lack of sleep, and didn't stay very long.</p>

<p>We ended playing 3.5 games over the course of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Here's what went down:</p>

<h2 id="super-cp---classic">Super CP - Classic!</h2>

<p>Warmed up with a classic "Super CP" scenario, defender with standard
armor + Mark III, attacker with Mark V (Huscarl!). I squeaked out a
marginal win by ramming the Combine CP on my last treads.</p>

<p>But there was no way I was going to get back off the map given I had no
more weaponry than a few AP guns.</p>

<h2 id="train-game-1">Train! (Game 1)</h2>

<p>I got the train off the board at the cost of a lot of units.  Probably a
marginal win for me. However, after playing the second game (below), 
we didn't count VPs and just assumed getting the train off the board
constituted victory. Which isn't quite right.</p>

<p>Ok, we played it wrong, not remembering that victory points are the point.</p>

<p>Too bad we didn't figure this out until most of the way through the next
gameâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="train-again-swapping-sides">Train again, swapping sides</h2>

<p>Dave M took the defense. As the attacker I tried to make an end run to
cut the track before the train entered, at the hideous expense of most
of my armor. This is where I found out infantry transport in Ogreverse
is not a good primary tactic. Costs too much attack factor.  Result, at
least tactical, probably decisive win for Dave M. This is where we
found out we were supposed to keep track of VPs, instead of whether the
train escaped east or not.</p>

<p>The victory point requirement makes transporting infantry <em>really</em>
expensive. While it only takes a single squad to cut a track, getting
that squad into position, in the case, was horrendous. Worse, I wasn't
able to make an end run around the defense. Hence, track didn't actually
get cut.</p>

<h2 id="kerry-andersons-the-final-frontier">Kerry Anderson's "The Final Frontier"</h2>

<p>Turns out both Dave M and I have <em>The Final Frontier</em>, an empire
building microgame by Kerry Anderson based in our solar system. We
played 5 turns to learn the rules. Initial impression: fun little game!
Phil Reed, currently a marketing officer for Steve Jackson Games, is
listed in the credits.</p>

<p>The first 5 turns went pretty fast. Perhaps next time we'll play 10
turns or more.</p>

<p>I like simple games such as <em>The Final Frontier</em> to close out a day.
Makes for a nice change of pace.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
