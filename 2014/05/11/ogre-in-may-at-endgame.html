                Ogre In May at Endgame
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 11 2014</time>
              <p>This is a report on the May 10th Ogre meetup at Endgame. It turns out
              only Dave M. and myself showed up for this, with a brief appearance from
              Caleb, who was suffering from lack of sleep, and didn't stay very long.</p>
              
              <p>We ended playing 3.5 games over the course of the afternoon.</p>
              
              <p>Here's what went down:</p>
              
              <h2 id="super-cp---classic">Super CP - Classic!</h2>
              
              <p>Warmed up with a classic "Super CP" scenario, defender with standard
              armor + Mark III, attacker with Mark V (Huscarl!). I squeaked out a
              marginal win by ramming the Combine CP on my last treads.</p>
              
              <p>But there was no way I was going to get back off the map given I had no
              more weaponry than a few AP guns.</p>
              
              <h2 id="train-game-1">Train! (Game 1)</h2>
              
              <p>I got the train off the board at the cost of a lot of units.  Probably a
              marginal win for me. However, after playing the second game (below), 
              we didn't count VPs and just assumed getting the train off the board
              constituted victory. Which isn't quite right.</p>
              
              <p>Ok, we played it wrong, not remembering that victory points are the point.</p>
              
              <p>Too bad we didn't figure this out until most of the way through the next
              gameâ€¦</p>
              
              <h2 id="train-again-swapping-sides">Train again, swapping sides</h2>
              
              <p>Dave M took the defense. As the attacker I tried to make an end run to
              cut the track before the train entered, at the hideous expense of most
              of my armor. This is where I found out infantry transport in Ogreverse
              is not a good primary tactic. Costs too much attack factor.  Result, at
              least tactical, probably decisive win for Dave M. This is where we
              found out we were supposed to keep track of VPs, instead of whether the
              train escaped east or not.</p>
              
              <p>The victory point requirement makes transporting infantry <em>really</em>
              expensive. While it only takes a single squad to cut a track, getting
              that squad into position, in the case, was horrendous. Worse, I wasn't
              able to make an end run around the defense. Hence, track didn't actually
              get cut.</p>
              
              <h2 id="kerry-andersons-the-final-frontier">Kerry Anderson's "The Final Frontier"</h2>
              
              <p>Turns out both Dave M and I have <em>The Final Frontier</em>, an empire
              building microgame by Kerry Anderson based in our solar system. We
              played 5 turns to learn the rules. Initial impression: fun little game!
              Phil Reed, currently a marketing officer for Steve Jackson Games, is
              listed in the credits.</p>
              
              <p>The first 5 turns went pretty fast. Perhaps next time we'll play 10
              turns or more.</p>
              
              <p>I like simple games such as <em>The Final Frontier</em> to close out a day.
              Makes for a nice change of pace.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
