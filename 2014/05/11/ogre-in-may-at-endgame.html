Ogre In May at Endgame
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 11 2014</time>
<p>This is a report on the May 10th Ogre meetup at Endgame. It turns out
only Dave M. and myself showed up for this, with a brief appearance from
Caleb, who was suffering from lack of sleep, and didn't stay very long.</p>

<p>We ended playing 3.5 games over the course of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Here's what went down:</p>

<h2 id="super-cp---classic">Super CP - Classic!</h2>

<p>Warmed up with a classic "Super CP" scenario, defender with standard
armor + Mark III, attacker with Mark V (Huscarl!). I squeaked out a
marginal win by ramming the Combine CP on my last treads.</p>

<p>But there was no way I was going to get back off the map given I had no
more weaponry than a few AP guns.</p>

<h2 id="train-game-1">Train! (Game 1)</h2>

<p>I got the train off the board at the cost of a lot of units.  Probably a
marginal win for me. However, after playing the second game (below), 
we didn't count VPs and just assumed getting the train off the board
constituted victory. Which isn't quite right.</p>

<p>Ok, we played it wrong, not remembering that victory points are the point.</p>

<p>Too bad we didn't figure this out until most of the way through the next
gameâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="train-again-swapping-sides">Train again, swapping sides</h2>

<p>Dave M took the defense. As the attacker I tried to make an end run to
cut the track before the train entered, at the hideous expense of most
of my armor. This is where I found out infantry transport in Ogreverse
is not a good primary tactic. Costs too much attack factor.  Result, at
least tactical, probably decisive win for Dave M. This is where we
found out we were supposed to keep track of VPs, instead of whether the
train escaped east or not.</p>

<p>The victory point requirement makes transporting infantry <em>really</em>
expensive. While it only takes a single squad to cut a track, getting
that squad into position, in the case, was horrendous. Worse, I wasn't
able to make an end run around the defense. Hence, track didn't actually
get cut.</p>

<h2 id="kerry-andersons-the-final-frontier">Kerry Anderson's "The Final Frontier"</h2>

<p>Turns out both Dave M and I have <em>The Final Frontier</em>, an empire
building microgame by Kerry Anderson based in our solar system. We
played 5 turns to learn the rules. Initial impression: fun little game!
Phil Reed, currently a marketing officer for Steve Jackson Games, is
listed in the credits.</p>

<p>The first 5 turns went pretty fast. Perhaps next time we'll play 10
turns or more.</p>

<p>I like simple games such as <em>The Final Frontier</em> to close out a day.
Makes for a nice change of pace.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
