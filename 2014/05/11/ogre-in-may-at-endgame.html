                Ogre In May at Endgame
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 11 2014</time>
              <p>This is a report on the May 10th Ogre meetup at Endgame. It turns out
              only Dave M. and myself showed up for this, with a brief appearance from
              Caleb, who was suffering from lack of sleep, and didn't stay very long.</p>
              
              <p>We ended playing 3.5 games over the course of the afternoon.</p>
              
              <p>Here's what went down:</p>
              
              <h2 id="super-cp---classic">Super CP - Classic!</h2>
              
              <p>Warmed up with a classic "Super CP" scenario, defender with standard
              armor + Mark III, attacker with Mark V (Huscarl!). I squeaked out a
              marginal win by ramming the Combine CP on my last treads.</p>
              
              <p>But there was no way I was going to get back off the map given I had no
              more weaponry than a few AP guns.</p>
              
              <h2 id="train-game-1">Train! (Game 1)</h2>
              
              <p>I got the train off the board at the cost of a lot of units.  Probably a
              marginal win for me. However, after playing the second game (below), 
              we didn't count VPs and just assumed getting the train off the board
              constituted victory. Which isn't quite right.</p>
              
              <p>Ok, we played it wrong, not remembering that victory points are the point.</p>
              
              <p>Too bad we didn't figure this out until most of the way through the next
              gameâ€¦</p>
              
              <h2 id="train-again-swapping-sides">Train again, swapping sides</h2>
              
              <p>Dave M took the defense. As the attacker I tried to make an end run to
              cut the track before the train entered, at the hideous expense of most
              of my armor. This is where I found out infantry transport in Ogreverse
              is not a good primary tactic. Costs too much attack factor.  Result, at
              least tactical, probably decisive win for Dave M. This is where we
              found out we were supposed to keep track of VPs, instead of whether the
              train escaped east or not.</p>
              
              <p>The victory point requirement makes transporting infantry <em>really</em>
              expensive. While it only takes a single squad to cut a track, getting
              that squad into position, in the case, was horrendous. Worse, I wasn't
              able to make an end run around the defense. Hence, track didn't actually
              get cut.</p>
              
              <h2 id="kerry-andersons-the-final-frontier">Kerry Anderson's "The Final Frontier"</h2>
              
              <p>Turns out both Dave M and I have <em>The Final Frontier</em>, an empire
              building microgame by Kerry Anderson based in our solar system. We
              played 5 turns to learn the rules. Initial impression: fun little game!
              Phil Reed, currently a marketing officer for Steve Jackson Games, is
              listed in the credits.</p>
              
              <p>The first 5 turns went pretty fast. Perhaps next time we'll play 10
              turns or more.</p>
              
              <p>I like simple games such as <em>The Final Frontier</em> to close out a day.
              Makes for a nice change of pace.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Something new: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last few years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something classic: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something again: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something Vietnam as I'm on a Vietnam binge.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air ware in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
