Chadwick's Battle for Moscow
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 24 2014</time>

<p>I've bought a few games lately. Not going to say how many. More than
one, let's leave it at that.</p>

<p>What I haven't done enough of is play the games I have already. Hence my
resolution to play at least one before buying another. This tougher than
one might think, as I don't have space to set up a long-running game,
and I like to write my game play as I go, which slows everything down
considerably.</p>

<p>Enough whining, let's put something on the table.</p>

<p>My entertainment this evening is Frank Chadwick's Battle for Moscow.
Small map, 40 counters, rules and turn tracker, supply your own dice.</p>

<p>Set up is easy, initial positions are marked on the map.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>The Germans move first, modulo the "special panzer movement" not
employed on Turn 1. That means straight to combat!</p>

<p>I like this game already.</p>

<p>And it's a "call your shots" kind of game, which I also like.</p>

<p>So the Germans take 3 Russian units off the map, right off the bat.</p>

<p>Now it's movement phase.</p>

<p>Hmph.</p>

<p>I didn't get a hole through the Russian line, so the ZOCs are going to
ruin the Germans day.</p>

<p>Russian turn 1: Railroads FTW!</p>

<p>And 5 replacements.</p>

<p>The replacements went far as possible forward on cities, then with my
rail movement, pushed everything as far forward as possible.</p>

<p>Combat!</p>

<p>Victory in the south: 5th, 3rd, 10th and 30th force a retreat of the
German 24th Panzer Corps at 1:1 odds with a roll of 1. However, the 24th
is stuck and can't retreat! Eliminated! Furthe combat results in AL, NE
or EX, which is fine for Russians, just hold the line.</p>

<p>Time to move, let's try holding the line on the fortifications.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>We'll go by phase.</p>

<p>German replacement phase: bring in panzers at 0101, north side of map.</p>

<p>Panzer movement: move panzers up to line.</p>

<p>Combat: Germans need to break out. At 1:1, the Germans have a 50% chance
of getting a 2 hex retreat from the Russian.  Result of combat ths phase
was mostly DR results or EX, net Russian retreat.</p>

<p>Movement: zocs are killing the Germans, very hard to break through.</p>

<p>Russian replacement phase: get as many pieces back on the board as
possible to test hypothesis that maintaining zocs is more important than
eliminating German units.</p>

<p>Combat: Russians managed to eliminate an infantry unit and a panzer unit
on EX results. This works really well for the Russians, as the
replacements counter the losses.</p>

<p>Movement: mud is coming, Russians just step back out of range of
German's single hex move.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3-mud">Turn 3 MUD!!!</h2>

<p>No combat for Germans, all the Russians are out of reach.</p>

<p>Russians use this turn to reposition as well, starting to circle up
around Moscow.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4-more-mud">Turn 4 More mud</h2>

<p>Germans do more repositioning, no combat.</p>

<p>Russians, same, no combat.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>Germans try to sweep panzers around the south, force a retreat of the
Russian 19th.</p>

<p>Russians knock out a couple of German infantry units, get some
exchanges, and force 41st Panzer back.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>Doesn't look like like the Germans can get a win, but they might pull
out a draw by sweepin around from the south and taking all the towns but
Moscow. Ryazam and Tula must fall! Movement phase puts panzers in
position for Tula.</p>

<p>Russians beat back the advance at Ryazan and retake Kaluga. Holding fast
everywhere else.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p>Germans get Kulaga back and take Tula; Ryazan can only be attacked at
less than 1:1, a definite blunder!</p>

<p>Russian win. Took 8 German units off the board, occupied Moscow, Ryazan
and Mozhiask.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This was my first game using zones of control. Overall, it felt like
zones of control benefitted the Russian player more than the German
player. This was likely due to not remembering to advance on defender
elimination or retreat. Very hard to penetrate a line with that advance.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<p>Forgot to adjust odds on forest and fortifications left 1 for Russian
defenders in early turns.</p>

<p>Did not know to advance attacker unit after defending unit is eliminated
or retreats. This is a pretty big blunder because the Germans really
need every hex they can get. I'm sure the German side especially
suffered for it as they <em>must</em> advance to win, whereas the Russians
may or may not benefit from advancing.</p>

<p>Germans not putting a piece which could take a 1:1 at Ryazan on the last
turn. Germans not advancing through lines during movement phase.</p>

<p>Replaced Russians at strength 5 during mud, instead of 4.</p>

<p>So, you might be wondering, which game did I buy after playing? I'll say
only that my tax return came.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
