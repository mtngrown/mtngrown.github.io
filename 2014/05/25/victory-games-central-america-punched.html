Victory Games Central America punched
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 25 2014</time>
<p>All completely punched. It took about a week of punching out 50-100
counters at a time. The game has 780 counters, so that's non-trivial.</p>

<p>One benefit of punching and clipping counters is getting familiar with
both common counters, because there are so many of them, and uncommon
counters, because there are so few.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of the order of battle for Scenario 1:</p>

<p class="standard_image_300"><img src="/images/ca_scenario1_oob.jpg" alt="OOB for Scenario 1" /></p>

<p>I put the counters into their own ziploc bag for easy access for a quick
solo game. The full campaign runs 10-20 hours, which is not bad at
all for this size of game. Comparable titles such as Victory Game's
"Vietnam" can run 100-200 hours.</p>

<h3 id="next-step">Next step</h3>

<p>The set up for Scenario 1 is really easy, but once it's set up, I'm very
sure I'll have no idea how what to do next. Since this is as much about
learning the rules, the next step should be combat. Even if it makes no
sense from a tactical point of view, learning the rules is pretty
important.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
