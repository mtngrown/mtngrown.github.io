                Moscow or Bust
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 26 2014</time>
              <p>A second round of solo play for Chadwick's <em>Battle for Moscow</em>.</p>
              
              <p>Some details:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>More or less followed all the rules this time.</li>
                <li>Played out in about 90 minutes solo. This feels about right
              as I'm still working through ZOC tactics.</li>
                <li>The game went to a draw with the deciding dice roll on the last battle
              at 1:1 to retake Ryazan. With a 50% chance to retake Ryazan for a
              Russian win, I rolled a 6, attacker step loss. Bummer.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>This turned out to be more or less a perfect solo game, with the
              last roll of the game deciding it, and with 50% odds as well.</p>
              
              <p>The mud really helps the Russians a lot.</p>
              
              <p>Next, I need to figure out how to crack this game for the Germans.
              I'm pretty sure I can fight it to a standstill as the Russians, every
              time.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
