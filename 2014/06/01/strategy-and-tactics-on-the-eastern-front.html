                Strategy and tactics on the Eastern Front
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun  1 2014</time>
              <p>Yesterday, May 31, 2014, I found myself at the local tabletop venue
              a bit early, so I set up Situation #6 classic PanzerBlitz for some solo
              play. My partner for the day was running very late, and didn't show up
              until I was 5 turns in. At that point, I narrated the remainder of the
              game to him as I finished it out solitaire. He's still learning the
              rules, so it wasn't a big deal.</p>
              
              <p>That was the tactical side.</p>
              
              <p>On the strategic side, we set up Battle for Moscow. I played Russians.</p>
              
              <p>I've played this game a couple of times solo, and had a pretty hard time
              making a breakthrough as Germans. What my opponent did in this game is
              pursue a number of 1:1 battles to break open a hole in my line, which I
              did not anticipate. Hence, I did not pull any units back for zone
              control. On his second turn, after combat, he had a straight shot to
              Moscow! And he took it!</p>
              
              <p>I managed to recapture Moscow (twice!) and was holding it at the end of
              the game. Since I had another city as well, it was a win for me.</p>
              
              <p>And a lesson that while 1:1 odds aren't that great for the attacker,
              it can still be useful to attack at 1:1.</p>
              
              <p>Today I got in a couple of games of Soviet Dawn. My goal was to use the
              Reorganization Table, which I had not yet used in previous games. The
              first game I lost on the political track pretty fast. I didn't score it.</p>
              
              <p>The second game I was able to get the Reorg table into play, and managed
              to score 27 points on a political victory, "Proud Soviet State."</p>

                  More PanzerBlitz. Situation 11 has not seen
                  any plays at all, and Situation 7 only a single solo play. Situations 10
                  and 12 have only been played FtF, without a detailed writeup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Arab Israeli Wars is coming!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
