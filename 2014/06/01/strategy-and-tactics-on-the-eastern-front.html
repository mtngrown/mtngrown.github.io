Strategy and tactics on the Eastern Front
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun  1 2014</time>
<p>Yesterday, May 31, 2014, I found myself at the local tabletop venue
a bit early, so I set up Situation #6 classic PanzerBlitz for some solo
play. My partner for the day was running very late, and didn't show up
until I was 5 turns in. At that point, I narrated the remainder of the
game to him as I finished it out solitaire. He's still learning the
rules, so it wasn't a big deal.</p>

<p>That was the tactical side.</p>

<p>On the strategic side, we set up Battle for Moscow. I played Russians.</p>

<p>I've played this game a couple of times solo, and had a pretty hard time
making a breakthrough as Germans. What my opponent did in this game is
pursue a number of 1:1 battles to break open a hole in my line, which I
did not anticipate. Hence, I did not pull any units back for zone
control. On his second turn, after combat, he had a straight shot to
Moscow! And he took it!</p>

<p>I managed to recapture Moscow (twice!) and was holding it at the end of
the game. Since I had another city as well, it was a win for me.</p>

<p>And a lesson that while 1:1 odds aren't that great for the attacker,
it can still be useful to attack at 1:1.</p>

<p>Today I got in a couple of games of Soviet Dawn. My goal was to use the
Reorganization Table, which I had not yet used in previous games. The
first game I lost on the political track pretty fast. I didn't score it.</p>

<p>The second game I was able to get the Reorg table into play, and managed
to score 27 points on a political victory, "Proud Soviet State."</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
