                Duel on the Steppe
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun  7 2014</time>
              <p>This is the second time I've had this set up. I wasn't able to get play
              started the first set up. This time, the computer is next to the game
              table, the reinforcements are laid out, errata is loaded in iPad for
              convenience, and there is nothing else on my plate other than the
              standard suite of the usual boring weekend chores. I should be able to
              get through at least a couple of turns if not the whole 4 turn Scenario
              1.</p>
              
              <h2 id="short-overview">Short overview</h2>
              
              <p>Each turn is composed of five phases:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Weather</li>
                <li>Reinforcement</li>
                <li>Air allotment</li>
                <li>Activation</li>
                <li>End of turn (bookkeeping)</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Hexes represent about 10 kilometers of terrain.</p>
              
              <p>Counters represent actual Order of Battle. This is really interesting to
              me coming from games such as Chadwicks's Battle for Moscow, PanzerBlitz
              and Ogre, where the counters represent anonymous units.</p>
              
              <p>1 movement point to leave EZOC. This is different from Battle for Moscow
              where units can leave EZOC without penalty.</p>
              
              <p>CRT is 2d6, and has both 3:2 and 2:3 odds columns. Column shifts induced
              by terrain, etc. do not accumulate, apply only the maximum.</p>
              
              <p>Finally, Mannstein repulsed this offensive, which would be a German win,
              which looks pretty tough from the perspective of Turn 1.</p>
              
              <p>Let's get started.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p>Weather: die roll: 1. From the weather table on the map, the conditions
              are Rain with Normal ground conditions. Each side is limited to one
              Fighter and one Close Air unit.</p>
              
              <p>No reinforcements on Turn 1.</p>
              
              <p>Air allotments reduced according to weather.</p>
              
              <p>Activation phase: time to "play ball" so to speak.</p>
              
              <h3 id="sw-front-1st-guards">SW Front: 1st Guards</h3>
              
              <p>First decision: move first or fight first?</p>
              
              <p>Let's fight, try to take out 3rd Pz HQ, sitting in Lisichansk. Taking
              Lisichansk is a VP for the Soviets as well. Hrm. Odds look crappy. Let's
              have the 19th Security and 35th Guards apply themselves to the 19 Pz
              division. Attack 9 against defense 5 is 3:2, across a minor river, shift
              Left, 1:1, 2d6: 9, <code>-/R2</code>, that is, no effect on the attacker, and a 2
              hex retreat by the 19th Panzer towards Karnyi Limon. The Russian choose
              to advance into the vacated territory.</p>
              
              <p>Ok, choosing SW Front to fight first was dumb. There are only a couple
              of German unit adjacent, and the odds aren't all that good. Should have
              moved first, then fought. Could have been much uglier for the Germans
              Anyway, movement: pressure the Germans hard.</p>
              
              <p>And draw another chitâ€¦</p>
              
              <h3 id="german-crrs-korps">German Cr/Rs Korps</h3>
              
              <p>Pull all units back towards Belgorod, putting GD in Belgorod. Units not
              making the distance holed up in the woods to the northeast of Belgorod,
              and hope very much not to be surrounded by Voronezh Front.</p>
              
              <p>Blunder here: should have used KampfGroup FB to restore the
              GrossDeutschland, but that would have left the GD further out though.</p>
              
              <h3 id="rd-tank-army">3rd Tank Army</h3>
              
              <p>Takes off after some nasty SS, surrounding the Fhr DR regiment.
              4:1 Combat results in a step loss and 3 hex retreat. This was almost
              surely overkill, but whatever.</p>
              
              <h3 id="vf-69th-army">VF 69th Army</h3>
              
              <p>Very few units in range, I activated most of them with 3rd Tank.
              Move first, take on KfG A hiding in the woods east of Belgorod
              at 8 AF/ 3DF, 2:1, shift 1L, 3:2, roll 6: 6, which is 1 step loss for
              attacker and retreat 2 for defender towards Belgorod.</p>
              
              <h2 id="rd-panzer">3rd Panzer</h2>
              
              <p>Can't do much, with not too many units. Consolidated forces where
              possible, but locked in by EZOCs everywhere.</p>
              
              <h3 id="okh">OKH</h3>
              
              <p>I need to blow some bridges, got the easternmost Donets bridge.
              Otherwise moving all units as fast as possible to bridges to get them
              blown up.</p>
              
              <h3 id="army-group-popov-apv">Army Group Popov (APV)</h3>
              
              <p>I think I may have moved this unit on a different activation.</p>
              
              <p>Oh well.</p>
              
              <p>Move, then fight.</p>
              
              <p>Took the bridge at Lisichansk. That's bad for 3rd Panzer.</p>
              
              <h3 id="th-army">69th Army</h3>
              
              <p>Putting some pressure on units in the middle of the map. Lots of small
              scale action, low odds, some attacker reduction, but also pushing
              defender back.</p>
              
              <h3 id="ss">SS</h3>
              
              <p>This is just in time for the Germans, as they need to bring some units
              closer in to shore up the defense. No combat on this activation, all
              movement.</p>
              
              <p>And that's it for Turn 1.</p>
              
              <p>I haven't used any air or artillery yet. Those will get rolled in after
              I get a good grip on the rest of the combat system.</p>
              
              <p>Technically, I think the VF and SWF get two and three more activations,
              respectively, but that just doesn't feel right at all to me. In fact, it
              feels really broken, so I'm not going to play it that way. Essentially,
              what it means is that the Russians get 2 moves for every 1 move the
              Germans get. It would have been easier if they had printed more
              counters, but the notion of mixing already drawn counters back into the
              pool just feels wrong. It makes it a lot harder to learn the game
              because these details have to be recorded somewhere.</p>
              
              <p>I'm tempted to just give the Russians another full move after all the
              counters are drawn, that would make it a lot easier to keep track of
              everything.</p>

              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
              
              <p>(June 8, 2013)</p>
              
              <p>Game play is going very slow, time to stopwatch turns.</p>
              
              <p>Weather: C/N, clear and normal. Good. Makes for easier game play.</p>
              
              <p>Reinforcement: Russian 40th Army attached to the Voronezh Front, will
              attempt to cut off Cr/Rs HQ units. German 3rd and 11th Pz divisions race
              to the Donets to help cut some bridges.</p>
              
              <p>Air allotment: not dealing with Air on this turn.</p>
              
              <p>Activationâ€¦and off we goâ€¦</p>
              
              <h3 id="army-group-popov">Army Group Popov</h3>
              
              <p>AGP is Southwest Front. Just the worst possible pull for the Germans.
              Moved everything within range to set up 4 battles:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>German (defending):
                  <ul>
                    <li>(10) 320th Infantry</li>
                    <li>(3) KfG B</li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <p>Russian (attacking):</p>
              
                  <ul>
                    <li>(3) 38th Guards (depleted)</li>
                    <li>(9) 4th Guards (armored)</li>
                    <li>(3) 11th Armor</li>
                    <li>(4) 297th Infantry</li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <p>We're looking at 19:10, 3:2 on the odds table, roll 8: <code>-/R2</code>, and
              defenders are happy to occupy Izyum. That actually worked out well
              for the Germans.</p>
              
                  <p>16 minutes in.</p>

                  <p>3:2 odds, roll 6, <code>1/R2</code>, eliminate the Russian 195th, Germans

              <p>The Germans have a hard time in this game, which is to be expected of
              anyone insisting on invading Russia.</p>
              
              <p>The mechanics seemed to be pretty straightforward, perhaps because for
              any rules such as air and chit pulling which I didn't understand, I just
              ignored and played what seemed to make sense.</p>
              
              <p>It's surprising the Germans managed to hold on as long as they did. One
              more turn and would be pretty ugly for the Germans though.</p>
              
              <p>The Russians can do better by moving faster and attcking more at lower
              odds to kick the Germans out of the cities for victory points.</p>
              
              <p>I could probably say more, but it's time to wrap it up and get ready to
              kick off the work week.</p>

                  <p>When SW Front has the first chit draw, it should move, then fight. In

                  <p>I've been activating whatever is in range with impunity. But the rules
              say that no combat unit can be actived more than once per game turn.
              So I have to remember from activation to activation which units have
              been previously activated.</p>

                  <p>Did not use the double chit pull. Just doesn't make any sense to me as
              I'm activating everything possible on the initial chit pull. That is,
              there would not be any units to be activated even if I used the second

                <li>Can one HQ unit activate movement for another HQ unit? The situation
              is where 1st Guards forgot to move along with its units, and is now
              "stranded" way behind the front. However, it could be "activated" by
              AGP to move to a more advantageous position.</li>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
