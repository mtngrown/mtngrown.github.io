Ground combat in Central America
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 14 2014</time>
<p>First: this brief note is about the out-of-print conflict simulation
"Central America" from Victory Games. If you're looking for <em>actual</em>
combat histories for Central America, you're in the wrong place.</p>

<hr />

<p>Read through the combat rules, and set up one of the examples for
ground units in combat, without air, artillery or helicopter support.
The CRT is a bit of bear, as the odds tables are written out to
accommodate defender's terrain. Normally, this sort of thing is done
with odds shift or die modifiers. Here, the columns do not correspond
exactly to specific odds in each column. This allows shifts right or
left at the same odds. It's an interesting system. The most difficult
part of it is tracking the die roll across a rather wide table. It's
hard to keep the eyes lined up on the correct row.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I've read in on line forums that the rules to this
game are too long. From the reading I've done so far, that hasn't been a
problem for me. While it's true that the page length of the rules is a
bit longer than most games (appr. 60 pages), many, possibly most pages
have detailed examples of play. This is really helpful for learning:
set up the same example and follow along on the map using the counters.</p>

<p>As a result of working through the single example of ground combat
above, I'm comfortable with the CRT, step losses, retreating units and
ZOCs, pursuit, and unit elimination.</p>

<p>If the examples for air combat, paratroopers, helicopter and insurgency
support are as good, that's about 1/3 of the game mechanics mastered.
(The other two thirds being movement and operations/supply,
respectively. For the basic game.)</p>

<p>I'd love to have some Vassal screen shots, but Vassal doesn't seem to
allow placing units in the module for this game.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
