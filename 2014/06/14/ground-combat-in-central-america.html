<p>First: this brief note is about the out-of-print conflict simulation
"Central America" from Victory Games. If you're looking for <em>actual</em>
combat histories for Central America, you're in the wrong place.</p>

<hr />

<p>Read through the combat rules, and set up one of the examples for
ground units in combat, without air, artillery or helicopter support.
The CRT is a bit of bear, as the odds tables are written out to
accommodate defender's terrain. Normally, this sort of thing is done
with odds shift or die modifiers. Here, the columns do not correspond
exactly to specific odds in each column. This allows shifts right or
left at the same odds. It's an interesting system. The most difficult
part of it is tracking the die roll across a rather wide table. It's
hard to keep the eyes lined up on the correct row.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I've read in on line forums that the rules to this
game are too long. From the reading I've done so far, that hasn't been a
problem for me. While it's true that the page length of the rules is a
bit longer than most games (appr. 60 pages), many, possibly most pages
have detailed examples of play. This is really helpful for learning:
set up the same example and follow along on the map using the counters.</p>

<p>As a result of working through the single example of ground combat
above, I'm comfortable with the CRT, step losses, retreating units and
ZOCs, pursuit, and unit elimination.</p>

<p>If the examples for air combat, paratroopers, helicopter and insurgency
support are as good, that's about 1/3 of the game mechanics mastered.
(The other two thirds being movement and operations/supply,
respectively. For the basic game.)</p>

<p>I'd love to have some Vassal screen shots, but Vassal doesn't seem to
allow placing units in the module for this game.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
