Korsun pocket no escape
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 15 2014</time>
<p>Got in a game of PanzerBlitz with SK.</p>

<p>This is the first time I've played through Situation 8. It's brutal on
the Germans when playing with standard spotting rules. With a proper
Russian defense, there is very little opportunity to set up CPs for
engaging the SPAs. I played the Germans and the SPAs never got off a
single shot.</p>

<p>I made a couple of very large blunders right away. The first was moving
a stack of Stus into a position where they could  be spotted by the
Russian CP. This called down 4:1 on the stack, producing 3 wreck on the
road. Almost game over before even getting started. What I should have
done was spread that stack out. Actually, I probably should have just
not moved them with sighting of the heavy mortars. As it turned out, I
didn't know where the heavy mortars were set up. Which is probably how
it should be, imperfect information and whatnot.</p>

<p>A second blunder, which was more a calculated risk, resulted in a 3
stack of PzKfwg IV being taken out on a 1:2 CAT. S rolled a 1.
That was Turn 2 or 3, and pretty much was the game at that point. I
wasn't able to bring enough fire power to clear a lane before he was
able to move his infantry into blocking positions by Turn 8 and 9.</p>

<p>I managed to eliminate 3 Russian units, and S got 16 Germans by the
time I conceded on Turn 9.</p>

<p>I would have played it out, but AS was up for a game, so S decided
to head home.</p>

<h2 id="rebalancing-situation-8">Rebalancing Situation #8</h2>

<p>Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As usual, once the Russian infantry get involved, it's really hard to
dislodge them, so reduce the number of Guards units by 2 or 3.</li>
  <li>Reduce the number of blocks and mines by half.</li>
  <li>Play the optional rule allowing all German units to spot for indirect
fire.</li>
  <li>Allow the German player "perfect information" on where units are
positioned. This would not have helped all that much, though.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any one of these would help balance it out.</p>

<p>I suspect the optional rules allowing <em>any</em> German unit to call for fire
would have made a huge difference.</p>

<h2 id="battle-for-moscow">Battle for Moscow</h2>

<p>Also played a round of Battle for Moscow with AS. One of the infantry
counters is missing from the game, it probably disappeared from the
previous play at Endgame. It's gone now. Will see about getting it
replaced.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
