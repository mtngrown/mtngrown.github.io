                Korsun pocket no escape
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 15 2014</time>
              <p>Got in a game of PanzerBlitz with SK.</p>
              
              <p>This is the first time I've played through Situation 8. It's brutal on
              the Germans when playing with standard spotting rules. With a proper
              Russian defense, there is very little opportunity to set up CPs for
              engaging the SPAs. I played the Germans and the SPAs never got off a
              single shot.</p>
              
              <p>I made a couple of very large blunders right away. The first was moving
              a stack of Stus into a position where they could  be spotted by the
              Russian CP. This called down 4:1 on the stack, producing 3 wreck on the
              road. Almost game over before even getting started. What I should have
              done was spread that stack out. Actually, I probably should have just
              not moved them with sighting of the heavy mortars. As it turned out, I
              didn't know where the heavy mortars were set up. Which is probably how
              it should be, imperfect information and whatnot.</p>
              
              <p>A second blunder, which was more a calculated risk, resulted in a 3
              stack of PzKfwg IV being taken out on a 1:2 CAT. S rolled a 1.
              That was Turn 2 or 3, and pretty much was the game at that point. I
              wasn't able to bring enough fire power to clear a lane before he was
              able to move his infantry into blocking positions by Turn 8 and 9.</p>
              
              <p>I managed to eliminate 3 Russian units, and S got 16 Germans by the
              time I conceded on Turn 9.</p>
              
              <p>I would have played it out, but AS was up for a game, so S decided
              to head home.</p>
              
              <h2 id="rebalancing-situation-8">Rebalancing Situation #8</h2>
              
              <p>Some ideas:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>As usual, once the Russian infantry get involved, it's really hard to
              dislodge them, so reduce the number of Guards units by 2 or 3.</li>
                <li>Reduce the number of blocks and mines by half.</li>
                <li>Play the optional rule allowing all German units to spot for indirect
              fire.</li>
                <li>Allow the German player "perfect information" on where units are
              positioned. This would not have helped all that much, though.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Any one of these would help balance it out.</p>
              
              <p>I suspect the optional rules allowing <em>any</em> German unit to call for fire
              would have made a huge difference.</p>
              
              <h2 id="battle-for-moscow">Battle for Moscow</h2>
              
              <p>Also played a round of Battle for Moscow with AS. One of the infantry
              counters is missing from the game, it probably disappeared from the
              previous play at Endgame. It's gone now. Will see about getting it
              replaced.</p>

                  More PanzerBlitz. Situation 11 has not seen
                  any plays at all, and Situation 7 only a single solo play. Situations 10
                  and 12 have only been played FtF, without a detailed writeup.

                  Arab Israeli Wars is coming!

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
