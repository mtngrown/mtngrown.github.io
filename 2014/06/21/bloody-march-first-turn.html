                Central America Scenario 1 - Bloody March
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 21 2014</time>
              <p>This afternoon's intent is to walk through the first turn of the first
              scenario "Bloody March" of Victory Game's Central America (CA).</p>
              
              <p>Getting through Turn 1 will be enough achievement for a late afternoon:
              Central America is - by far - the most complex game I've started working on.
              VG's Viet Nam may be even more complex, but I haven't punched it out and started
              reading the rules yet. However, since CA allows simulating a full-on
              WWIII situation, CA may indeed go beyond Vietnam in complexity.</p>
              
              <h2 id="bloody-march-scenario-details">Bloody March scenario details</h2>
              
              <p>"Bloody March" is a simple scenario, with 15 total counter on the map, 2
              of which are entrenchments and one of which is a CIA helicopter, leaving
              12 ground units.</p>
              
              <h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
              
              <p>Each faction in this scenario gets the following resources:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>FDN:
                  <ul>
                    <li>4 Insurgency command points</li>
                    <li>0 Reorganization points</li>
                    <li>0 Supply depots</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>FSLN:
                  <ul>
                    <li>2 Insurgency command points</li>
                    <li>0 Reorganization points</li>
                    <li>0 Supply depots</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Zero reorganization and supply depots simplifies the scenario, allowing
               the focus to be on the insurgency operations.</p>
              
              <h3 id="victory-conditions">Victory conditions</h3>
              
              <p>Eliminate as many units as possible and occupy the
              village of Las Vegas. The point breakdown:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>4 points for occupying the village of Las Vegas</li>
                <li>1 point for each enemy ground unit eliminated</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Let's play…</p>
              
              <h2 id="abort-abort-abort">Abort! Abort! Abort!</h2>
              
              <p>My original intention was to play out just one turn using all the rules
              in every phase for the turn. After some detailed perusal of the rules
              for each phase, this proved a bigger task than warranted.  It's not
              helping that it's Saturday afternoon, and I'm coming down from my weekly
              caffiene binge. Body feels achy and dull, mind full of cotton.</p>
              
              <p>Instead, let's skip all the rules except "move," and
              "shoot," and play through all five turns.</p>
              
              <p>First question: who has the first move? Inferring from the Phases
              explanation, the Communist player always moves first.</p>
              
              <p>…</p>
              
              <p>Ok, that went pretty fast, there are only 15 counters on the board after
              all, and two of those are entrenchments. Upshot: FDN crushed FSLN by
              remaining in control of the Las Vegas village, and destroying some of
              the FSLN ground units. It felt unbalanced, and I'm not sure exactly why.</p>
              
              <p>This is going to require another play, using the full phase. Here's
              another attempt at <a href="http://localhost:4568/2014/06/29/bloody-march-turn-1.html">Bloody March, Turn
              1</a>.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Something new: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last few years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something classic: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something again: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something Vietnam as I'm on a Vietnam binge.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air ware in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
