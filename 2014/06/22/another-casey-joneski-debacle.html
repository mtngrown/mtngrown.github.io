                Another Casey Joneski debacle
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 22 2014</time>
              <p>Apparently, Steve Jackson Game's Ogre Designers Edition (ODE for short)
              is one of these things which a very large number of otherwise "serious"
              wargamers have purchased, surreptitiously. I keep running into people
              who bought a copy, but haven't yet played it. Even curiouser, I've
              spoken with some of these same people in the past, and they haven't
              mentioned that they, too, couldn't resist 28 lbs of Ogre-y delight.</p>
              
              <p>In any case, three of us, Al, Andrew and I, met up at the local store to
              get in a few games of ODE. Lately, we've focused on the train scenarios,
              because they seem lopsided, which means none of us understand quite how
              to play them.</p>
              
              <p>Game 1: Me attacking Andrew. I split 15 GEVs, some to the east, some to
              west, some up the middle. The GEVs which went up the middle got
              slaughtered. The GEVs that went east, pretty much got slaughtered. To
              the west, wasn't able to catch the train in time.</p>
              
              <p>However, I did manage to sneak one GEV through the woods and cut the
              train tracks, whence the train went off the eastern edge of the board.
              Result, draw.</p>
              
              <p>Game 2: Another Casey Joneski, Andrew taking on Al. Andrew took his GEVs
              all the east and all the way west. After some tense moments, it turned
              out to be a win for Andrew, as he diverted then destroyed the train, and
              got 8 GEVs off the south edge. It was close though, coming down to a
              couple of die rolls which would have taken out one last GEV to get a
              draw. The lesson in this game is <em>never</em> count the infantry out until
              the game is completely over.</p>
              
              <p>Game 3: The Train scenario, Al attacking me as defender. I took a mobile
              howitzer and two super heavies, the rest GEVs. Al made a hideous blunder
              by leaving open a stack of GEVs early on, and the super heavy took out 3
              of 5 right away, and another shortly thereafter. It went downhill for Al
              after that.</p>
              
              <p>In all, good times.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.

                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
