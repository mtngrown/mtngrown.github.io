Bloody March Turn 1
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 29 2014</time>
<p>Now that it's a week after my <a href="/2014/06/21/bloody-march-first-turn.html">initial aborted attempt at playing
Bloody March</a>,
let's give Bloody March another try with the full rule set.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Back to business. I don't see any way around going through each phase in
gruesome detail. That's the best I've found to learn for myself, even if
it is the most boring.</p>

<h3 id="fsln-phases">FSLN phases</h3>

<p>Scenario 1 uses standard rules, all the intervention rules phases are
ignored.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Supply: all FSLN units in supply, by definition all units are
considered to be in supply on the first game turn unless the scenario
dictates otherwise. (In the this scenario, the Honduran 4th regiment
at Mandasta is out of supply until the start of Game Turn 4).
Since there are no Supply Depots available, Communist supply phase is
over.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ground unit reorganization: no reorg points, skip.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Regular Ground Unit Movement: FSLN moves to encircle fortified
position. Note that this is only the regular forces, insurgents
can move on this phase as regular units, or the next phase as
insurgent units. Details:
    <ul>
      <li>NI 50-02 X moves from 2311 to 2310 Las Trojes. This is within the
  ZOC of the FDN forces on 2410 (Las Vegas), so it requires the entire
  movement allowance (normally 4).</li>
      <li>NI Lopz X moves from 2511 to 2510, again, a single hex due to FDN
  ZOC centered on 2410. This concludes FSLN regular movement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Insurgency Movement: as it turns out, I could have just moved the
current insurgents during regular movement phase, as I don't need to
leverage the "insurgent reserve." But since I didn't move them during
regular movement, I'll move them now:
    <ul>
      <li>NI Pom II: from 2511 to 2510. I could move further as insurgents
aren't bound by ZOCs, but that's where I want it anyway.
Insurgency Reserve status marked. Note that the insurgent unit
doesn't have to pay normal movement costs.</li>
      <li>NI Uman II: from 2411 to 2310, leveraging the ability to move
through the Allied ZOC with impunity. Insurgency Reserve status
marked.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Insurgency Placement: I think this is a good idea, because FSLN have
only 2 insurgency points against FDN 4, and needs to get as much combat
as fast as possible:
    <ul>
      <li>First attempt is to emplace regiment of MRH (an attractive yellow
colored counter). Costs 1 insurgency point to make the attempt.
Die roll 4, +1 for placing in home country, success for forest
placement at hex 2411.</li>
      <li>Since insurgent units are considered support units for stacking
purposes, let's try to place another one at 2411: Die roll 5,
success and an MRP unit enters the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Neither of these units can move this turn, but they can fight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Allied Aerial Counterinsurgency</em>: The successful placements are bad
 for the Allies. Unfortunately, 3 Bombardment points are necessary to
 undertake an Aerial Counterinsurgency, so the CIA helicopter stays
 home (in Silca).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First Insurgency Disbandment: will keep insurgents this turn for
 fighting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Air Mission: no air assets for FSLN in this scenario.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Ground Combat: FSLN attacks FDN in fortified postion 2410:
    <ul>
      <li>Attacking:
        <ul>
          <li>(2) Lopz from 2510</li>
          <li>(2) 50 02 from 2310</li>
          <li>(2) Veng from 2411</li>
          <li>(1) Uman 2310</li>
          <li>(1) Pom from 2510</li>
          <li>8 total attack</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Defending FDN from entrenchment:
        <ul>
          <li>(2) Leg</li>
          <li>(2) Cim</li>
          <li>4 total defend</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Odds 8:4, 2:1, roll 3, -2 DRM defender advantage for fortification,
+1 DRM for attacking insurgent, result 2 yeilds attacker step loss
with no retreat. That's actually not bad. <em>Veng</em> takes the step loss.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that I'm assuming that the entrenchment forces combined defense
  as a stack. If this is not the case, a better attack would be 4:1,
  which would give a 2/3 chance of defender step loss and retreat. In
  this case, that would be an elimination. Except! Defenders in a
  fortification or entrenchment can ignore retreats.</p>

    <p>Rules clarification: Each of these units may be attacked separately,
  but they both have to be attacked. That is, the rules specify that
  if a unit in a hex is attacked, all the units in that hex must be
  attacked, but each unit may be attacked independently.</p>

    <p>A better attack may have been to attempt to get a 3:1 on one unit
  and a 1:1 on another. This would have almost certainly resulted in
  an attacker step loss (perhaps more than one), but it would have a
  higher probability of a defender step loss as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reserve Movement: Since the FDN <em>Leg</em> and <em>Cim</em> units have only 1 AF,
I'll move the NI <em>Uman</em> from 2310 and <em>Pom</em> from 2510 to 2409, which will be
punishing on FDN supply next turn. Reserve markers removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second Insurgency Disbandment: keeping insurgents this turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helicopter Transport: FSLN has no helicopters in this scenario.
Bummer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Return to Base: no helicopters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Reinforcement: No reinforcements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fdn-phases">FDN phases</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Supply: Turn 1 all units considered in supply unless dictated
otherwise by the scenario.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ground unit reorganization: No reorganization points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Regular Ground Unit Movement: The FDN <em>Leg</em> and <em>Cim</em> regiments need
to stay put in Las Vegas, that's victory ground after all. This leaves
the Honduran unit:
    <ul>
      <li>HN <em>4</em> moves 2 hexes along road from 1811 to 1910.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Insurgency Movement: the <em>Salz</em>, <em>Sjec</em> and <em>Seg</em> insurgent units:
    <ul>
      <li>The insurgents move from 2612 to 2511, reserve marker placed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insurgency Placement: Definitely need some insurgents here. FDN has 4
points to spend:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>First attempt, emplace <em>FRDA</em> at 2511. Roll 1, +1 DRM for home country,
unsuccessful. Down to 3 IP. Try again…</li>
      <li>Second attempt, emplace <em>Qui</em> at 2511, roll 1, unsuccessful.  Again…</li>
      <li>Third attempt: <em>MLN</em> at 2511, roll 1, no dice.</li>
      <li>Fourth attempt: <em>Cond</em> at 2511, roll 6, success.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Well, that surely sucked for the Allied forces, considering the +1
provided about an 83% chance of success. Three 1s in row. Sheesh.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>FSLN Aerial Counterinsurgency</em>: ain't got no wings, so there's no
aerial counterinsurgency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First Insurgency Disbandment: not disbanding any insurgents this turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Air Mission: FDN has CIA helicopter support. How shall these allows
employ this asset? Three options for this bird:
    <ol>
      <li>Air to ground combat, seems to be covered by the Bombardment
rules.</li>
      <li>Close air support, requires ground combat on same target.</li>
      <li>Transport.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In this case, close air support of ground combat is warranted. Since
there is no other air asset, a +1 Close Air Support marker is placed
on <em>Lopz</em> at 2510, as this is the unit coming under Allied attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Ground Combat, one attack, as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>On the attack:
        <ul>
          <li>(1) <em>SJec</em> from 2610</li>
          <li>(1) <em>Salz</em> from 2610</li>
          <li>(1) <em>Cond</em> from 2511</li>
          <li>(1) <em>Cim</em> from 2410</li>
          <li>(1) <em>Leg</em> from 2410</li>
          <li>(1) CIA helicopter</li>
          <li>6 Total</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Defending:
        <ul>
          <li>(3) <em>Lopz</em> at 2510</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Odds 6:3 yeild 2:1, defender is leg unit in forested terrain, roll 2,
+1 for Close Air Support, +1 for insurgent unit attacking, one column
shift right for attack helicopter, from CRT value 4 yeilds <code>-/1,R</code>
defender step loss and retreat to 2408. Not bad, <em>Lopz</em> is a powerful unit.</p>

    <p>Attacker chooses not to pursue, as the leg units would be giving up a
lot of defensive strength in the entrenched hex, and insurgency
reserve move can occupy that area anyway.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Reserve Movement:
    <ul>
      <li><em>SJec</em> and <em>Seg</em> from 2610 to 2510</li>
      <li><em>Salz</em> from 2610 to 2511</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second Insurgency Disbandment: Keeping the single unit activated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helicopter Transport: mission already flown in CAS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Return to Base: helicopter back to Silca.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Reinforcement: no reinforcements in this scenario.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, that's it for Turn 1, and we're talking hours of work. Here's a
snapshot, blurry from mobile phone but still useful:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/bloody_march_turn_1_cropped_resized.jpg" alt="Bloody March end of Turn
1" /></p>

<p>Score: FDN 4, FSLN 0.</p>

<p>This is the FDN's game to lose, by dint of setting up on the Las Vegas
village for 4 VPs.</p>

<p>Play continues with <a href="/2014/07/27/bloody-march-turn-2.html">Bloody March
Turn 2</a>.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
