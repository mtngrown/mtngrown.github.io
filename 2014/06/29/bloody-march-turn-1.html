                Bloody March Turn 1
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 29 2014</time>
              <p>Now that it's a week after my <a href="/2014/06/21/bloody-march-first-turn.html">initial aborted attempt at playing
              Bloody March</a>,
              let's give Bloody March another try with the full rule set.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p>Back to business. I don't see any way around going through each phase in
              gruesome detail. That's the best I've found to learn for myself, even if
              it is the most boring.</p>
              
              <h3 id="fsln-phases">FSLN phases</h3>
              
              <p>Scenario 1 uses standard rules, all the intervention rules phases are
              ignored.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Supply: all FSLN units in supply, by definition all units are
              considered to be in supply on the first game turn unless the scenario
              dictates otherwise. (In the this scenario, the Honduran 4th regiment
              at Mandasta is out of supply until the start of Game Turn 4).
              Since there are no Supply Depots available, Communist supply phase is
              over.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Ground unit reorganization: no reorg points, skip.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Regular Ground Unit Movement: FSLN moves to encircle fortified
              position. Note that this is only the regular forces, insurgents
              can move on this phase as regular units, or the next phase as
              insurgent units. Details:
                  <ul>
                    <li>NI 50-02 X moves from 2311 to 2310 Las Trojes. This is within the
                ZOC of the FDN forces on 2410 (Las Vegas), so it requires the entire
                movement allowance (normally 4).</li>
                    <li>NI Lopz X moves from 2511 to 2510, again, a single hex due to FDN
                ZOC centered on 2410. This concludes FSLN regular movement.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Insurgency Movement: as it turns out, I could have just moved the
              current insurgents during regular movement phase, as I don't need to
              leverage the "insurgent reserve." But since I didn't move them during
              regular movement, I'll move them now:
                  <ul>
                    <li>NI Pom II: from 2511 to 2510. I could move further as insurgents
              aren't bound by ZOCs, but that's where I want it anyway.
              Insurgency Reserve status marked. Note that the insurgent unit
              doesn't have to pay normal movement costs.</li>
                    <li>NI Uman II: from 2411 to 2310, leveraging the ability to move
              through the Allied ZOC with impunity. Insurgency Reserve status
              marked.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Insurgency Placement: I think this is a good idea, because FSLN have
              only 2 insurgency points against FDN 4, and needs to get as much combat
              as fast as possible:
                  <ul>
                    <li>First attempt is to emplace regiment of MRH (an attractive yellow
              colored counter). Costs 1 insurgency point to make the attempt.
              Die roll 4, +1 for placing in home country, success for forest
              placement at hex 2411.</li>
                    <li>Since insurgent units are considered support units for stacking
              purposes, let's try to place another one at 2411: Die roll 5,
              success and an MRP unit enters the game.</li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <p>Neither of these units can move this turn, but they can fight.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><em>Allied Aerial Counterinsurgency</em>: The successful placements are bad
               for the Allies. Unfortunately, 3 Bombardment points are necessary to
               undertake an Aerial Counterinsurgency, so the CIA helicopter stays
               home (in Silca).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>First Insurgency Disbandment: will keep insurgents this turn for
               fighting.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Air Mission: no air assets for FSLN in this scenario.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Ground Combat: FSLN attacks FDN in fortified postion 2410:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Attacking:
                      <ul>
                        <li>(2) Lopz from 2510</li>
                        <li>(2) 50 02 from 2310</li>
                        <li>(2) Veng from 2411</li>
                        <li>(1) Uman 2310</li>
                        <li>(1) Pom from 2510</li>
                        <li>8 total attack</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Defending FDN from entrenchment:
                      <ul>
                        <li>(2) Leg</li>
                        <li>(2) Cim</li>
                        <li>4 total defend</li>
                      </ul>
              
                      <p>Odds 8:4, 2:1, roll 3, -2 DRM defender advantage for fortification,
              +1 DRM for attacking insurgent, result 2 yeilds attacker step loss
              with no retreat. That's actually not bad. <em>Veng</em> takes the step loss.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <p>Note that I'm assuming that the entrenchment forces combined defense
                as a stack. If this is not the case, a better attack would be 4:1,
                which would give a 2/3 chance of defender step loss and retreat. In
                this case, that would be an elimination. Except! Defenders in a
                fortification or entrenchment can ignore retreats.</p>
              
                  <p>Rules clarification: Each of these units may be attacked separately,
                but they both have to be attacked. That is, the rules specify that
                if a unit in a hex is attacked, all the units in that hex must be
                attacked, but each unit may be attacked independently.</p>
              
                  <p>A better attack may have been to attempt to get a 3:1 on one unit
                and a 1:1 on another. This would have almost certainly resulted in
                an attacker step loss (perhaps more than one), but it would have a
                higher probability of a defender step loss as well.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Reserve Movement: Since the FDN <em>Leg</em> and <em>Cim</em> units have only 1 AF,
              I'll move the NI <em>Uman</em> from 2310 and <em>Pom</em> from 2510 to 2409, which will be
              punishing on FDN supply next turn. Reserve markers removed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Second Insurgency Disbandment: keeping insurgents this turn.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Helicopter Transport: FSLN has no helicopters in this scenario.
              Bummer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Return to Base: no helicopters.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Reinforcement: No reinforcements.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3 id="fdn-phases">FDN phases</h3>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Supply: Turn 1 all units considered in supply unless dictated
              otherwise by the scenario.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Ground unit reorganization: No reorganization points.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Regular Ground Unit Movement: The FDN <em>Leg</em> and <em>Cim</em> regiments need
              to stay put in Las Vegas, that's victory ground after all. This leaves
              the Honduran unit:
                  <ul>
                    <li>HN <em>4</em> moves 2 hexes along road from 1811 to 1910.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Insurgency Movement: the <em>Salz</em>, <em>Sjec</em> and <em>Seg</em> insurgent units:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The insurgents move from 2612 to 2511, reserve marker placed.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Insurgency Placement: Definitely need some insurgents here. FDN has 4
              points to spend:</p>
              
                  <ul>
                    <li>First attempt, emplace <em>FRDA</em> at 2511. Roll 1, +1 DRM for home country,
              unsuccessful. Down to 3 IP. Try again…</li>
                    <li>Second attempt, emplace <em>Qui</em> at 2511, roll 1, unsuccessful.  Again…</li>
                    <li>Third attempt: <em>MLN</em> at 2511, roll 1, no dice.</li>
                    <li>Fourth attempt: <em>Cond</em> at 2511, roll 6, success.</li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <p>Well, that surely sucked for the Allied forces, considering the +1
              provided about an 83% chance of success. Three 1s in row. Sheesh.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><em>FSLN Aerial Counterinsurgency</em>: ain't got no wings, so there's no
              aerial counterinsurgency.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>First Insurgency Disbandment: not disbanding any insurgents this turn.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Air Mission: FDN has CIA helicopter support. How shall these allows
              employ this asset? Three options for this bird:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Air to ground combat, seems to be covered by the Bombardment
              rules.</li>
                    <li>Close air support, requires ground combat on same target.</li>
                    <li>Transport.</li>
                  </ol>
              
                  <p>In this case, close air support of ground combat is warranted. Since
              there is no other air asset, a +1 Close Air Support marker is placed
              on <em>Lopz</em> at 2510, as this is the unit coming under Allied attack.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Ground Combat, one attack, as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>On the attack:
                      <ul>
                        <li>(1) <em>SJec</em> from 2610</li>
                        <li>(1) <em>Salz</em> from 2610</li>
                        <li>(1) <em>Cond</em> from 2511</li>
                        <li>(1) <em>Cim</em> from 2410</li>
                        <li>(1) <em>Leg</em> from 2410</li>
                        <li>(1) CIA helicopter</li>
                        <li>6 Total</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Defending:
                      <ul>
                        <li>(3) <em>Lopz</em> at 2510</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <p>Odds 6:3 yeild 2:1, defender is leg unit in forested terrain, roll 2,
              +1 for Close Air Support, +1 for insurgent unit attacking, one column
              shift right for attack helicopter, from CRT value 4 yeilds <code>-/1,R</code>
              defender step loss and retreat to 2408. Not bad, <em>Lopz</em> is a powerful unit.</p>
              
                  <p>Attacker chooses not to pursue, as the leg units would be giving up a
              lot of defensive strength in the entrenched hex, and insurgency
              reserve move can occupy that area anyway.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Reserve Movement:
                  <ul>
                    <li><em>SJec</em> and <em>Seg</em> from 2610 to 2510</li>
                    <li><em>Salz</em> from 2610 to 2511</li>
                  </ul>

              <p>Ok, that's it for Turn 1, and we're talking hours of work. Here's a

              <p>This is the FDN's game to lose, by dint of setting up on the Las Vegas

                  any plays at all, and Situation 7 only a single solo play. Situations 10

                <li>
                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
