                Objective Kiev
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  2 2014</time>
              <p>One of the cool things about magazine games is small size, which usually
              means fast setup and always means portability. Objective Kiev and Battle
              for Moscow can be bagged together in a slim, plastic folio for
              protection. The resulting package looks vaguely official, something that
              might carry a boring lease contract, or the collected gas bills for the
              year, instead of something plastered with panzers and sure to attract
              unwanted attention if not outright ridicule.</p>
              
              <p>Solo play through.</p>
              
              <p>Setup is about 30 minutes, this is the second time. With a little
              practice, should be 5-10 minute set up in the future.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img title="Objective Kiev Setup" src="/images/objective_kiev_setup.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
              
              <p>Time to start rolling dice.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p>This is where I learn the rules, and why things are the way they are.</p>
              
              <p>For example, the initial setup dictates that Russian armies must not be
              placed adjacent to each other. This results in armies (infantry)
              alternating with corps (mechanized). One reason this makes sense is game
              play, setting up two mechanized next to each other is inviting a fast
              German punch through the line.</p>
              
              <p>The Germans more or less punch a hole, but don't advance as far as they
              could.</p>
              
              <p>The Russians beat a fast retreat and will attempt to defend the cities
              in the southwest part of the map: Iasi, Chernovtsy, and Stanislav. This
              is going to be impossible, though, because they need to stay in supply.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
              
              <p>Hungarian and Slovakian corps enter as reinforcements. German infantry
              is going to swing a bit east, then south, to try and cut off Russian
              supply.</p>
              
              <p>Germans attempting to squeeze the Russians out of supply such that DR
              results in elimination.</p>
              
              <p>Russians start to get replacements now.</p>
              
              <p>I have to speed this up, I don't have all day.</p>
              
              <h2 id="several-more-turns-transpire">Several more turns transpireâ€¦</h2>
              
              <p>I've got to be someplace in 30 minutes, and the game is at the top of
              Turn 6. It looks a lot like the Russians will win it, mainly by bogging
              down the German at the south end of the map. The German would now be in
              the position of moving long distances across the map for lower adds
              attacks. The main problem for the Germans is the defense in depth
              guarding Kirovograd. It looks like it would be really difficult to take
              Kirovograd in two turns, given 5 steps of Russian replacements will come
              in right there.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img title="Objective Kiev Top of Turn 6" src="/images/objective_kiev_turn_6_start.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
              
              <p>As you can see, the Germans would need to either swing around from the
              north, or punch a hole through a developing line. The north has those
              pesky forest hexes which slow down movement. Punching a hole would be
              easy given three turns to ensure the hole is exploited.</p>
              
              <p>In this game as in Battle for Moscow, once a defending unit is in a
              position where retreat will cause step losses or outright elimination,
              lower odds attacking becomes a viable. A unit doesn't need to be
              destroyed if it's pinned without a way to move, and not strong enough to
              attack.</p>
              
              <p>Definitely looking forward to playing this one with an opponent.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.

                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.

                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
