Terrans get tooled
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  6 2014</time>

<p>Got in a quick game of Starship Troopers, Scenario 1, this time played
correctly.</p>

<p>Here's the set up for the Skinnies:</p>

<p><img src="/images/starship-troopers/scenario_1_setup.jpg" alt="Skinny set up for Scenario
1" /></p>

<p>This picture is terrible, it was at night with an old iPhone camera. At
some point I'll replace it. Regardless of the picture quality the
important thing is the positioning for the Skinnies, which is shown
clearly enough.</p>

<p>The idea is set up all the targets behind a defensive line along the
road, where the Skinnies get road bonus moving from strong point to
strong point.</p>

<h2 id="terrans-all-over-the-map">Terrans all over the map</h2>

<p>The Skinnies had the Terran forces running all over the map.</p>

<p>Final score was Humanoids 29, Terrans 25.</p>

<p>And this is with unavoidable "intelligence" attempting to play both
sides fairly solitaire. I think this could be pretty hard to win as the
Terrans, against someone who really has it together playing the
Humanoids in Scenario 1.</p>

<p>Shouldn't be too hard to handicap though, just reduce decoys and
workers. Alternatively, with a powerful Terran player, add decoys and
workers.</p>

<p>Pretty good game, really. The only thing I found kind of wack was
massive counter stacking, but I understand this was not uncommon in '70s
era games. And it makes sense given this game and the unit scale.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
