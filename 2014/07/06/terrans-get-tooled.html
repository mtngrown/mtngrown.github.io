                Terrans get tooled
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  6 2014</time>
              <p>Got in a quick game of Starship Troopers, Scenario 1, this time played
              correctly.</p>
              
              <p>Here's the set up for the Skinnies:</p>
              
              <p><img alt="Skinny set up for Scenario
              1" src="/images/starship-troopers/scenario_1_setup.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>This picture is terrible, it was at night with an old iPhone camera. At
              some point I'll replace it. Regardless of the picture quality the
              important thing is the positioning for the Skinnies, which is shown
              clearly enough.</p>
              
              <p>The idea is set up all the targets behind a defensive line along the
              road, where the Skinnies get road bonus moving from strong point to
              string point.</p>
              
              <h2 id="terrans-all-over-the-map">Terrans all over the map</h2>
              
              <p>The Skinnies had the Terran forces running all over the map.</p>
              
              <p>Final score was Humanoids 29, Terrans 25.</p>
              
              <p>And this is with unavoidable "intelligence" attempting to play both
              sides fairly solitaire. I think this could be pretty hard to win as the
              Terrans, against someone who really has it together playing the
              Humanoids in Scenario 1.</p>
              
              <p>Shouldn't be too hard to handicap though, just reduce decoys and
              workers. Alternatively, with a powerful Terran player, add decoys and
              workers.</p>
              
              <p>Pretty good game, really. The only thing I found kind of wack was
              massive counter stacking, but I understand this was not uncommon in '70s
              era games. And it makes sense given this game and the unit scale.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Something new: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last few years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something classic: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something again: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something Vietnam as I'm on a Vietnam binge.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air ware in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
