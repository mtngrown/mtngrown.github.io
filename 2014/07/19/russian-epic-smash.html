<p>Finished up game 2 of PanzerBlitz Situation #9. It was a decisive German
victory.</p>

<p>This was largely due to 3 factors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Russians entered in road march order, which allowed some
immediate German action to eliminate truck transports.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Russians attempted to take the "fast road" through Bednost,
which is the obvious thing, but had to tread lightly as the Germans
emplaced a pair of 75mm ATGs. That hill top is just small enough
to put enemy armor into the doubled AF range.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Germans were able to move some units to block the exit road
wrapping around Hill 135. This was a huge Russian blunder, and may
have been a result of losing track of the turn counter.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, as mentioned in the writeup for the first game of Situation #9,
it feels fairly well-balanced, but it demands a high level of skill to
play either side effectively. For the Germans, getting the initial
emplacement is critical. For the Russians, slowing down to fight is
probably a mistake, except that the victory conditions require a certain
number of German eliminations.</p>

<p>Overall, good game. I've had it on the table all week, and was able to
get through the first five turns during the week, and finished up it
today.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
