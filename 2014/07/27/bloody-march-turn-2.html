Bloody March Turn 2
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul 27 2014</time>

<p>Picking up from <a href="/2014/06/29/bloody-march-turn-1.html">Bloody March Turn
1</a>â€¦</p>

<h3 id="fsln-phases">FSLN phases</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Supply: On Turn 1, it's a reasonable assumption that all units are in
supply, given that the Honduran unit (CES) is specifically marked out of
supply. (Which turns out to be specified in Section 9.4.)
The situation hasn't changed all that much for Turn 2, but it's
worth working through the supply rules in more detail, as it might be a
way to dislodge the FDN from their entrenched position in Las Vegas.</p>

    <p>Recall that each player must trace supply during Supply Phase
regardless of which is the phasing player.</p>

    <p>First, supply can be obtained from</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Supply Sources, which come in two flavors:  green-bordered hexes,
and Supply Source markers</li>
      <li>Supply Depots, which are counters placed in specific hexes and used
once. No Supply Depots in this scenario.</li>
      <li>Moving Logistical Support Units (counters markers "lsu"), none in
this scenario.</li>
      <li>Friendly fortifications and entrenchments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since there are no Supply Depots or LSUs in this scenario, we use green-bordered
hexes.</p>

    <p>Tracing supply for FSLN: pretty much everything can be traced into the
town of Ocotal (hex 2012). Note that the Honduran unit (HN CES) is
threatening the FSLN's supply line.</p>

    <p>For FDN, the supply lines can (evidently) source from the entrenchment
at Las Vegas (hex 2410), or trace overland through 2611 and 2712 to
the trial connecting to the road to La Rosita (hex 3211).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ground unit reorganization: skip, no reorganization points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Regular Ground Unit Movement:
    <ul>
      <li>Lopz: 2309 -&gt; 2310.</li>
      <li>Uman &amp; Pom: 2310.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This results in a 2 brigade, 2 insurgency stack in 2310, which is
allowed under stacking rules as the insurgents count as support units.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insurgency Movement: I'm not moving any of the other insurgents, as
I'm going to use them in an attack on the entrenched position.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insurgency Placement: Out of insurgency points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Allied Aerial Counterinsurgency</em>:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First Insurgency Disbandment: Keeping all the insurgents for this turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Air Mission: No air.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ground Combat: All of the FSLN units attack the FDN entrenchment at
2:1 odds. DRM -2 for entrenchment, +1 for insurgent attacking, -1
total DRM. Roll 4 - 1 yeilds 3 on 2:1 which is <code>-:-</code>. Better than
attacker losses, but still not seeing how FSLN can win this one
without dislodging entrenchment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reserve Movement: No reserves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second Insurgency Disbandment: Keeping all insurgents for now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helicopter Transport: No helicopters for FSLN.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Return to Base: No helicopters for FSLN.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Reinforcement: No reinforcements.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I'm playing this wrong, but I can't figure out how to crack the
entrenched position. It supplies itself, which makes it tough. One thing
I might have been able to do is keep the entrenchment surrounded such
that it couldn't be reinforced by insurgents. Unfortunately, that lends
itself to being attrited due to low defense factors. Big stack yeild
large defense factors.</p>

<h3 id="fdn-phases">FDN phases</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Supply: All units in supply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ground unit reorganization: no reorganization points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regular Ground Unit Movement: HN CES to 1909, this unit hurting do to
out of supply. SJac and Sag to 2509, Cong to 2510, 2509. Salz stacking
onto 2410, nearly impregnable, now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insurgency Movement: moved as regular units.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insurgency Placement: No more insurgency points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>FSLN Aerial Counterinsurgency</em>: FSLN ain't got no wings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First Insurgency Disbandment: not disbanding any.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Air Mission: none.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ground Combat: Forget it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reserve Movement: Everything moved as regular infantry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second Insurgency Disbandment: keeping insurgents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helicopter Transport: Didn't do it, but might have been smart to
pick up, say, the HN unit, or an insurgency unit in case the FSLN come
knocking at Silca.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Return to Base: N/A</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reinforcement: no reinforcements.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Score: FDN 4, FSLN 0.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
