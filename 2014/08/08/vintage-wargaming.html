<p>Why play wargames which are 20, 30 or even 40 or more years old?</p>

<p>Many reasons could be given, but the most important reason is
many of these games are still fun to play!</p>

<p>The state of the art has advanced considerably, in all respects.
Computers have provided sophisticated graphical design tools,
manufacturing techniques have greatly improved, and the fundamental
mechanics of modern games probably, on average, are better than
most vintage games.</p>

<p>From what I understand, until recently, older games of all sorts
could be acquired cheaply on EBay, second hand shops and related
venues. Within the last couple of years, prices for many older
games have skyrocketed.</p>

<p>However, a large number of excellent games are still available
for anyone making even cursory effort, and relatively inexpensively.
Considering the cost of a new wargame, with hundreds of counters
and one or more mounted mapboards, the original purchase price
of $10-$12 seems like a great deal, even if the used price is
$20-$30.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-older-games-cheap">How to get older games cheap</h2>

<p>It's not that difficult. Look for games for which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the pieces are punched,</li>
  <li>the box has considerable wear,</li>
  <li>the price is significantly lower than mint or new copies.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can find scanned copies of rules, counters, maps or
other game pieces, it's sometimes possible to find <em>mostly</em>
complete games for very cheap.</p>

<p>This strategy works for me because once I take interest in a particular
game, I don't mind buying a couple of battered copies and bashing a
playable set together (with spares!). For example, I have three copies
of PanzerBlitz. While it turns out that two of the boxes are in pretty
good shape, the third box is battered and taped together. This is the
box I actually play. (It also turns out the all three copies were
complete when I received them, a grateful surprise.)</p>

<h2 id="punched-or-unpunched">Punched or unpunched?</h2>

<p>Another benefit of buying used games already punched is you don't
have to punch them. I have a copy of Victory Game's <em>Viet Nam 1965
1975</em> which I can't bring myself to punch. Consequently, I'm looking
for a couple of cheap copies which may or may not be complete.</p>

<p>The best of both worlds here is "partially punched," because it's
easy to determine whether any counters are missing, and being
partially punched is license to complete punching it out.</p>

<h2 id="playing-vintage-wargames">Playing vintage wargames</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Record keeping: I've taken to stocking most of my older games
with a couple of cheap mechanical pencils and a pad or two of
Post-It notes. Neither take up a lot of space, and having a scratch
pad handy for calculations is indispensible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Players aids: may or may not extensive, but if they are extensive, you
have a related problem: game playing space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Physical space. Where to put everything? Some of these older games
just take up a <em>lot</em> of space.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you find a game you like, and you can get inexpensive copies, or
find "print and play" components, seriously consider annotating and
modifying your game to fit your taste. Obviously, this isn't something
you would want to do with a brand new game which may have considerable
resale value, but your second or third copy of game won't have much
resale value in any case.</p>

<h2 id="more-benefits">More benefits</h2>

<p>Good vintage games acquire a community of dedicated players, and quite
often, a raft of player aids, new scenarios, counters, etc. For example,
the PanzerBlitz series of games has hundreds of community created
counters, and dozens of different maps.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
