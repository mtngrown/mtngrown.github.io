                Vintage Wargaming
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug  8 2014</time>
              <p>Why play wargames which are 20, 30 or even 40 or more years old?</p>
              
              <p>Many reasons could be given, but the most important reason is
              many of these games are still fun to play!</p>
              
              <p>The state of the art has advanced considerably, in all respects.
              Computers have provided sophisticated graphical design tools,
              manufacturing techniques have greatly improved, and the fundamental
              mechanics of modern games probably, on average, are better than
              most vintage games.</p>
              
              <p>From what I understand, until recently, older games of all sorts
              could be acquired cheaply on EBay, second hand shops and related
              venues. Within the last couple of years, prices for many older
              games have skyrocketed.</p>
              
              <p>However, a large number of excellent games are still available
              for anyone making even cursory effort, and relatively inexpensively.
              Considering the cost of a new wargame, with hundreds of counters
              and one or more mounted mapboards, the original purchase price
              of $10-$12 seems like a great deal, even if the used price is
              $20-$30.</p>
              
              <h2 id="how-to-get-older-games-cheap">How to get older games cheap</h2>
              
              <p>It's not that difficult. Look for games for which:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>all the pieces are punched,</li>
                <li>the box has considerable wear,</li>
                <li>the price is significantly lower than mint or new copies.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>If you can find scanned copies of rules, counters, maps or
              other game pieces, it's sometimes possible to find <em>mostly</em>
              complete games for very cheap.</p>
              
              <p>This strategy works for me because once I take interest in a particular
              game, I don't mind buying a couple of battered copies and bashing a
              playable set together (with spares!). For example, I have three copies
              of PanzerBlitz. While it turns out that two of the boxes are in pretty
              good shape, the third box is battered and taped together. This is the
              box I actually play. (It also turns out the all three copies were
              complete when I received them, a grateful surprise.)</p>
              
              <h2 id="punched-or-unpunched">Punched or unpunched?</h2>
              
              <p>Another benefit of buying used games already punched is you don't
              have to punch them. I have a copy of Victory Game's <em>Viet Nam 1965
              1975</em> which I can't bring myself to punch. Consequently, I'm looking
              for a couple of cheap copies which may or may not be complete.</p>
              
              <p>The best of both worlds here is "partially punched," because it's
              easy to determine whether any counters are missing, and being
              partially punched is license to complete punching it out.</p>
              
              <h2 id="playing-vintage-wargames">Playing vintage wargames</h2>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Record keeping: I've taken to stocking most of my older games
              with a couple of cheap mechanical pencils and a pad or two of
              Post-It notes. Neither take up a lot of space, and having a scratch
              pad handy for calculations is indispensible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Players aids: may or may not extensive, but if they are extensive, you
              have a related problem: game playing space.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Physical space. Where to put everything? Some of these older games
              just take up a <em>lot</em> of space.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>If you find a game you like, and you can get inexpensive copies, or
              find "print and play" components, seriously consider annotating and
              modifying your game to fit your taste. Obviously, this isn't something
              you would want to do with a brand new game which may have considerable
              resale value, but your second or third copy of game won't have much
              resale value in any case.</p>
              
              <h2 id="more-benefits">More benefits</h2>
              
              <p>Good vintage games acquire a community of dedicated players, and quite
              often, a raft of player aids, new scenarios, counters, etc. For example,
              the PanzerBlitz series of games has hundreds of community created
              counters, and dozens of different maps.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.

                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
