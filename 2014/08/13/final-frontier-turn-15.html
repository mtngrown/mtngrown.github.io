                Final Frontier Turn 15
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 13 2014</time>
              <p>Cranked out 5 turns of The Final Frontier last night, putting me through
              the end of Turn 15. Notable events include Chartreuse getting that
              Colony 4 emplaced on Mars ahead of Magenta, and eliminating <em>another</em>
              of Magenta's mines in the ensuing Random Events roll. In response to
              this, Magenta spent all saved build points populating the Asteroid Belt
              with more mines, got a mine placed on Europa, and will emplace a Colony
              2 on Europa on Turn 16. This should help reduce the GNP disparity
              Magenta has been suffering from, as Chartreuse has to play catch-up on
              the Jovian.</p>
              
              <p>It seems to be allowed in the rules to move mines after being replace by
              colonies, provided the appropriate build points for transport are paid.
              There might be a good house rule here charging 1 BP to decommission a
              mine, and another BP to recommission it.</p>
              
              <p>Here's the state of the Solar System:</p>
              
              <p>Chartreuse:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Income: Mercury 2 x 5 + Moon 2 x 4 + Mars 3 x 5 + Mines 5 + 4 + 2 + 1
              = 50</li>
                <li>GNP: 115 + 50 = 165</li>
                <li>NI: 5</li>
                <li>BP: 11 + 1</li>
                <li>Spend: M1 Mars 2 BP and launch 1 BP; M1 Earth and launch 2 + 1 BP;
              activate M1 0525 2 BP = 8 BP, 4 BP carry over.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Deep space: M1 to 0525, M1 from Mars to 0423.</p>
              
              <p>Magenta:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Income: Mercury 2 x 5 + Moon 2 x 4 + Mars 2 x 5 + Mines 5 + 1 + 2 + 1</li>
                <li>5 = 47</li>
                <li>GNP: 100 + 47 = 147</li>
                <li>NI: 5</li>
                <li>BP: 9</li>
                <li>Spend: Activate 0323 2 BP; build C2 Earth and launch 4 + 1 BP; 7 BP
              spent, 2 carry over.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Deep space: M1 to Europa, C2 to 0422.</p>
              
              <p>Status:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Chartreuse: Mercury C2, Moon C2, Mars C4, Active M1 on 0123, 0222,
              0322, 0525, 0526, M1 deep space to Europa 0422.</li>
                <li>Magenta: Mercury C2, Moon C2, Mars C3, Europa M1, active M1 on 0123,
              0222, 0323, 0524, 0525, 0526; C2 deep space to Europa on 0422.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Summary: Magenta's intended strategy of moving up the NI chart is being
              confounded by Chartreuse's ability to outbuild and dice luck. Hence,
              Magenta switching to building a lot more to generate revenue, and
              protect against the loss of a mine given another unlucky espionage
              event.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
