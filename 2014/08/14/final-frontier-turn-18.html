Final Frontier Turn 18
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 14 2014</time>
<p>This is the last turn of "Game 1.5" as Chartreuse seems to be in a
runaway leader situation. This is partly due to the initial purchase
decisions, but I think mostly due to luck, which I'll document in detail
below.</p>

<p>(Game "0.5" was a 5 turn game played with someone else.)</p>

<p>But first, let's get the stats down for this turn.</p>

<p>Chartreuse:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income: Mercury 10, Moon 8, Mars 20, Europa 8, Ganymede 1, AB
5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 68</li>
  <li>GNP: 115 + 68 = 183</li>
  <li>NI: 5</li>
  <li>BP: 14 + 8</li>
  <li>Spend: Build C2 on Earth and launch to Jupiter: 5 BP, 17 carryover.</li>
  <li>Deep space: C2 on 0523, M1 0824.</li>
</ul>

<p>Magenta:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income: Mercury 10, Moon 8, Mars 15, Europa 8, Ganymede 6, Callisto 3,
AB 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 64</li>
  <li>GNP: 100 + 64 = 164</li>
  <li>NI: 5</li>
  <li>BP: 11 + 9</li>
  <li>Spend: Colony 4 on Earth launch to Mars, 17 BP, 3 carry over.</li>
  <li>Deep space: M1 to 1125</li>
  <li>Random events: roll 3:3 for 8:3, NI - 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Status:</p>

<p>Chartreuse: Mercury C2, Moon C2, Mars C4, Europa C2, Ganymede M1, AB
fully occupied with M1, C2 in transit to Jupiter in 0523, M1 in transit
to Saturn in 0824.</p>

<p>Magenta: Mercury C2, Moon C2, Mars C4, Europa C2, Ganymede C2, Callisto
M1, all AB occupied, M1 in transit to Saturn in 1125.</p>

<p>I'm conceding this game as Magenta, too much bad luck has let Chartreuse
pull too far ahead. Here's how the cookie crumbled:</p>

<p>The combination starting second with less GNP, losing mines on random
events, and frankly, mostly bad die rolls puts Magenta in a bit of hole.</p>

<p>If this were a 4 player game, as Magenta, I would probably sit back and
let the others play "bash the leader" while I worked at building
production capacity, and trying very hard to maintain a lead in NI.</p>

<p>As this game unfolded, the 1 point lead in NI was not enough to offset
Chartreuse's initial choices and luck.</p>

<p>My plan was to play this one out to either 60 turns or 300 GNP,
whichever came first, modulo World War event. What I'll do instead
is close this game here, and pick it back up at Turn 19 assuming
Magenta rolled a NI + 1 on the random events roll. That should help
even it up a bit.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
