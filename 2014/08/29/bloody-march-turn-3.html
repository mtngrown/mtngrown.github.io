                Bloody March Turn 3
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 29 2014</time>
              <p>Time again for my once-a-month foray into the beastly Central America. I
              really like the <em>concept</em> of this game, but I haven't quite picked up
              the flow of it yet, and that's only using the ground forces. But let's
              continue on.</p>
              
              <p>The score so far is FDN 4, FSLN 0, by dint of the FDN occupying the Las
              Vegas village which is worth 4 VPs.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
              
              <p>Picking up from <a href="/2014/07/27/bloody-march-turn-2.html">Bloody March Turn 2</a>,
              it appears that the FDN is impregnable in their entrenchment at the town
              of Las Vegas, so the FSLN needs to find better hunting elsewhere. For
              example, picking on the out-of-supply Honduran unit CES.</p>
              
              <h3 id="fsln-phases">FSLN phases</h3>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Supply: All FSLN units are in supply with the green-bordered hex 2012
              containg the town of Ocotal.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Regular Ground Unit Movement:</p>
              
                  <ul>
                    <li>Veng: 2411 to 2212. Only 3 MP! Entering a forest hex costs 2 MP. So
              take the road south.</li>
                    <li>Lopz: 2310 to 2208, road movement.</li>
                    <li>50-02: 2310 to 1910, getting behind the HN unit using road movement.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Insurgency Movement:</p>
              
                  <ul>
                    <li>Uman, Pom: 2310 to 1908, HDN is now ZOC'ed, insurgency units exert a ZOC
              for combined defense value of 2 or more.</li>
                    <li>Mrh, Estr, PVP: 2411 to 2208.</li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <p>Insurgents ignore terrain costs for movement.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>First Insurgency Disbandment: None.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Ground Combat:
              Pom, Uman and 50-02 take on HN CES, which is out of supply in 1909. The
              odds are 4:1, +1 DRM for attacking insurgency units. Allied force
              decides to not use air defense as that would use up the helicopter
              activation for this turn. At 4:1 +1 DRM, minimum attacker step loss plus
              retreat. Since HN CES is EZOC'ed, that's two step losses for an
              elimination, and a VP for the commies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Reserve Movement: None.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Second Insurgency Disbandment: None.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Reinforcement: No reinforcements.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>The Communist phase went pretty fast this time. I'm getting the hang of
              where to find the right rule when I need it.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Supply: All units in supply given the entrenchment provides supply at
              Las Vegas. Otherwise, in supply from trail connection to La Rosita.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Regular Ground Unit Movement: None, holding fast at Las Vegas.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Insurgency Movement:</p>
              
                  <ul>
                    <li>Sjac, Cond, Seg from 2509 to 2107 to reinforce the helicopter on the
              entrenched position at Silca.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Air Mission: None, will use helicopter mission for ground combat
              support. This was a mistake; had I used the helicopter for ground combat
              defense of HN, it would have resulted in an attacker step loss (because
              I recomputed the odds and rolled to see what would have happened). I
              had intended on using the helicopter on the proceeding ground combat
              phase, but there won't be one this turn for the FDN.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Ground Combat: None, holding fast.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Reserve Movement: All insurgents moved.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Second Insurgency Disbandment: None.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Helicopter Transport: None, HN got eliminated.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Return to Base: Never left base.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Reinforcement: No reinforcements.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Score: FSLN 1, FDN 4</p>
              
              <p>This game isn't all that difficult, but there are a lot of different
              capabilities to keep in mind. It's getting easier, and will get a lot
              easier once I've pushed a lot more pieces around the board.</p>
              
              <p>One interesting thing which I've noticed from the initial game up until
              now in this game, is if there is any chance at all of getting a
              unilateral attacker step loss during the communist combat phase, I've
              been getting it. What are the odds? The only success I've had so far is
              overwhelming odds where I don't have to roll the die. Seriously, while
              there isn't much rolling, I seem to be consistently rolling 1s and 2s
              every one all the communist attacks.</p>
              
              <p>This turn took about an hour to play, including the writeup and all
              associated rules lookups.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Bloody March end of Turn 3" src="/images/bloody_march_turn_3.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Here's what it looks like at the end of Turn 3. Veng is probably out of
              play, it won't be able to get anywhere useful in 2 turns.</p>

                  this game is still in shrink.
