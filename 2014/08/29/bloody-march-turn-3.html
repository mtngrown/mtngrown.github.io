<p>Time again for my once-a-month foray into the beastly Central America. I
really like the <em>concept</em> of this game, but I haven't quite picked up
the flow of it yet, and that's only using the ground forces. But let's
continue on.</p>

<p>The score so far is FDN 4, FSLN 0, by dint of the FDN occupying the Las
Vegas village which is worth 4 VPs.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Picking up from <a href="/2014/07/27/bloody-march-turn-2.html">Bloody March Turn 2</a>,
it appears that the FDN is impregnable in their entrenchment at the town
of Las Vegas, so the FSLN needs to find better hunting elsewhere. For
example, picking on the out-of-supply Honduran unit CES.</p>

<h3 id="fsln-phases">FSLN phases</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Supply: All FSLN units are in supply with the green-bordered hex 2012
containg the town of Ocotal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regular Ground Unit Movement:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Veng: 2411 to 2212. Only 3 MP! Entering a forest hex costs 2 MP. So
take the road south.</li>
      <li>Lopz: 2310 to 2208, road movement.</li>
      <li>50-02: 2310 to 1910, getting behind the HN unit using road movement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insurgency Movement:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Uman, Pom: 2310 to 1908, HDN is now ZOC'ed, insurgency units exert a ZOC
for combined defense value of 2 or more.</li>
      <li>Mrh, Estr, PVP: 2411 to 2208.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Insurgents ignore terrain costs for movement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First Insurgency Disbandment: None.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ground Combat:
Pom, Uman and 50-02 take on HN CES, which is out of supply in 1909. The
odds are 4:1, +1 DRM for attacking insurgency units. Allied force
decides to not use air defense as that would use up the helicopter
activation for this turn. At 4:1 +1 DRM, minimum attacker step loss plus
retreat. Since HN CES is EZOC'ed, that's two step losses for an
elimination, and a VP for the commies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reserve Movement: None.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second Insurgency Disbandment: None.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reinforcement: No reinforcements.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Communist phase went pretty fast this time. I'm getting the hang of
where to find the right rule when I need it.</p>

<h3 id="fdn-phases">FDN phases</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Supply: All units in supply given the entrenchment provides supply at
Las Vegas. Otherwise, in supply from trail connection to La Rosita.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regular Ground Unit Movement: None, holding fast at Las Vegas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insurgency Movement:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sjac, Cond, Seg from 2509 to 2107 to reinforce the helicopter on the
entrenched position at Silca.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First Insurgency Disbandment: None.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Air Mission: None, will use helicopter mission for ground combat
support. This was a mistake; had I used the helicopter for ground combat
defense of HN, it would have resulted in an attacker step loss (because
I recomputed the odds and rolled to see what would have happened). I
had intended on using the helicopter on the proceeding ground combat
phase, but there won't be one this turn for the FDN.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ground Combat: None, holding fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reserve Movement: All insurgents moved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second Insurgency Disbandment: None.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helicopter Transport: None, HN got eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Return to Base: Never left base.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reinforcement: No reinforcements.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Score: FSLN 1, FDN 4</p>

<p>This game isn't all that difficult, but there are a lot of different
capabilities to keep in mind. It's getting easier, and will get a lot
easier once I've pushed a lot more pieces around the board.</p>

<p>One interesting thing which I've noticed from the initial game up until
now in this game, is if there is any chance at all of getting a
unilateral attacker step loss during the communist combat phase, I've
been getting it. What are the odds? The only success I've had so far is
overwhelming odds where I don't have to roll the die. Seriously, while
there isn't much rolling, I seem to be consistently rolling 1s and 2s
every one all the communist attacks.</p>

<p>This turn took about an hour to play, including the writeup and all
associated rules lookups.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/bloody_march_turn_3.jpg" alt="Bloody March end of Turn 3" /></p>

<p>Here's what it looks like at the end of Turn 3. Veng is probably out of
play, it won't be able to get anywhere useful in 2 turns.</p>

<p>The saga continues in <a href="/2014/09/01/bloody-march-turn-4.html">Bloody March Turn
4</a>.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
