A first look at SPI's StarForce
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep  1 2014</time>
<p>This article will end up getting written over the course of several days
to a week, or more. It's Labor Day evening, and work kicks off tomorrow
morning, and I need to get the games out of my head for a few weeks.
Work will be busy, and some career stuff is coming up as well.</p>

<h2 id="scenario-2">Scenario 2</h2>

<p>The initial move allows positioning at Epsilon Indi before the Solar
Hegemony arrives, which puts the SH at a combat disadvantage.</p>

<p>Victory conditions, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Occupy Epsilon Indi (2325/-10)for 2 consecutive turns, or</li>
  <li>neutralize opposing stargate, where neutralizing opposing
stargate trumps occupation of Epsilon Indi.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the following, SH stands for Solar Hegemony, EEF stands for Epsilon
Eridani Forces.</p>

<p>Here's the initial set up showing the EEF's preliminary shift:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/starforce_scenario_1_initial.jpg" alt="Initial position of starforces in Scenario
1" /></p>

<p>The yellow forces (A, B and C) are Epsilon Eridani, the blue Solar
Hegemony (J, K, L and M).</p>

<h3 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h3>

<p>EEF shifts 2 star forces to occupy Epsilon Indi system.</p>

<p>SH shifts 2 star forces to position above Epsilon Indi.</p>

<h3 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h3>

<p>EEF holds fast, SH shifts zulu down to occupy Epsilon Indi as well.</p>

<p>Now it's time to battle it out. This is going to be interesting as
combat relies on imperfect imformation, bidding on atteck versus
defensive strength points, but I'll know both. Hopefully the scenario is
odds-balanced 50/50 on each side making perfect moves and combats. It
probably isn't, but it might well be close.</p>

<h4 id="turn-2-combat">Turn 2 combat</h4>

<p>Segment 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SH: 2/2, -1, roll d10: 1, result 0.</li>
  <li>EEF: 3/3, +1, roll d10: 1, result 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Segment 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SH: 3/3, 0, roll d10: 2, result 0.</li>
  <li>EEF: 3/3, 0 roll d10: 5, result 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>One SH starforce is eliminated.</p>

<p>Segment 3:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SH: 2/1, 0, roll d10: 2, result 0.</li>
  <li>EEF: 4/2, 2, roll d10: 1, result 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Segment 4:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SH: 2/1, 0, roll d10: 9, result 1.</li>
  <li>EEF: 4/2, +2, roll d10: 4, result 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both EEF and SH lose a starforce. Since one faction is completely
  eliminated, this battle, and turn, is over.</p>

<p>The EEF now has to expose their stargate to get 2 starforces onto
Epsilon Indi for a win. The SH needs to knock out the EEF stargate.</p>

<h3 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h3>

<p>EEF holds fast at Epsilon Indi to establish 2 turn occupation. The Solar
Hegemony makes a desperate gamble and shifts towards Epsilon Eridani. If
they can just neutralize the Epsilon Eridani stargate, they win.</p>

<h3 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h3>

<p>EEF is occupying Epsilon Indi with 2 starforces (B and C), SH has to shift L and M
to the EEF stargate and neutralize to win.</p>

<h4 id="turn-4-combat">Turn 4 combat</h4>

<p>Segment 1: Since a stargate cannot attack or be attacked in the first
combat segment, we move to segment 2 where the invading SH forces L and
M are allowed full combat effectiveness.</p>

<p>Segment 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EEF, 3/2, +1, roll d10: 8, result 2.</li>
  <li>SH, 4/2, +2, roll d10: 2, result 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Result 2 eliminates both SH starforces for an EEF win.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This is a very odd little game, and feels quite elegant. The odds are
such that one side or another should have an advantage, but it's not
clear to me which side it will be. It actually feels pretty well
balanced, given the amount of chance involved.</p>

<p>Another cool thing about the game is a "push your luck" mechanic with
both combat and shifting. This ensures both glorious victories and
horrible defeats. While at the same time, someone could play a very
conservative game close to the odds, and systematically chip away at his
or her opponent.</p>

<p>I will definitely be playing this again!</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
