                Bloody March Turn 4
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep  1 2014</time>
              <p>Turn 3 was so much easier (and more fun) than any of the previous turns
              in this game or the first that it's not even 3 days and I'm motivated to
              get through another turn. And maybe even finish up the Bloody March
              scenario through Turn 5. We'll see.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>
              
              <p>Continuing from <a href="/2014/08/29/bloody-march-turn-3.html">Bloody March Turn
              3</a>, we find that the Honduran CES
              has been sent packing, and the FDN forces are all huddled up in
              entrenched positions, half at Las Vegas, the remaining with the CIA
              helicopters at Silca.</p>
              
              <p>The FSLN has decided this is <em>most</em> unsatisfactory, and will attempt to
              dislodge the CIA forces at Silca.</p>
              
              <p>This will take more than one turn as 50-02 moves slowly north.</p>
              
              <h3 id="fsln-phases">FSLN phases</h3>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Supply: In supply.</li>
                <li>Regular Ground Unit Movement:
                  <ul>
                    <li>50-02: from 1909 to 1908</li>
                    <li>Lopz: from 2208 to 2108</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Insurgency Movement:
                  <ul>
                    <li>PVP, Estr from 2208 to 2108</li>
                    <li>MRH from 2208 to 2007</li>
                    <li>Pom, Uman from 1909 to 2007</li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <p>What FSLN is trying to do here is manage a 1:1 attack which is going
              to almost certainly cost an insurgency unit, but has a small (1/6) of
              reducing the defenders by one unit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>First Insurgency Disbandment: None.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Ground Combat: Actually, this is the game, as the defender is in a
              mountain jungle hex, with a ground combat helicopter of AF with column
              shift 1L, and insurgents in the defense. The net result is -2 DRM which
              will be defender retreat at best. There is no possibility of defender
              step reduction.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Since I could easily move all FSLN units pretty much out of easy reach of
              FDN, such that if the FDN went chasing one group of commies, the other
              would swoop in and take the position at Silca.</p>
              
              <p>Final score: FDN 4, FSLN 1, Marginal Victory for FDN.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Final configuration at end of FSLN phase, Bloody March Turn
              4" src="/images/bloody_march_turn_4.jpg" />.</p>
              
              <p>This is where I called the game. It might have been mildly interesting
              to see whether the FDN could have achieved better than Marginal Victory,
              but it's Labor Day, and I have stuff to do which is more interesting.</p>
              
              <h2 id="after-action-report">After Action Report</h2>
              
              <p>This was a long adventure for such a short game.</p>
              
              <p>As it turns out, the historical result was a Decisive Victory for the
              FDN forces.</p>
              
              <p>Had this game played out completely, that could have still been a
              possibility. On the other hand, the FSLN forces were in pretty good
              position to repulse attacks, and some bad die rolling could also reduce
              it to a Stalemate.</p>
              
              <h3 id="some-thoughts-on-the-game">Some thoughts on the game</h3>
              
              <p>This first full play through has been quite a challenge. This is definitely
              the most complex game I've played. In terms of absolute complexity, my
              hunch is that it's near the top of a middle tier complexity, perhaps a
              6, or the bottom of top tier of complexity, maybe 7, out of 9. Most of
              the complexity is associated with the following:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Long phase sequence on each turn, 16 phases for the standard game, 19
              for the intervention game.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Large variety of combat types, including ground to ground with armor
              and infantry, air to ground, ground to air, close air support, air to
              air, probably more with the intervention game and naval and marine
              forces coming into play.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Combat and movement factors are very small compared with other games.
              For example, with a movement factor of 3, in the forest, crossing a
              river hex requires the entire MF of 2 for forest hex entry plus one for
              crossing a river. Note that this applies to regular units. Insurgent
              units do not pay movement penalties.</p>
              
                  <p>This has a side effect (or maybe a main effect) of making roads and
              trails extremely valuable to control.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The insurgency rules add an unusual dimension to the game, almost like
              having a second game running underneath the main game. The movement,
              combat advantages and ephemeral nature of the insurgent forces requires
              a fair bit of thought for effectively employing these forces.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>While the above adds a fair bit of complexity, it turns out the that
              record tracks manage what could have been a bookkeeping blowout. Other
              than perhaps figuring odds, there is no need (so far) in the standard
              game to break out the Mark I lead pencil. That in itself feels like
              quite an acheivement to me.</p>
              
              <p>The rule book is one of the best I've seen. While it's thick-ish (~60
              pages for the standard game, 40 more for the intervention game), the
              rules are remarkably clear. So much so that the few rules which are
              vague or ambiguous really stand out. When the ambiguity is easily
              noticed, it's much easier to infer intent, or at least provide a
              reasonable house rule in lieue of a ruling.</p>
              
              <h3 id="no-dispersal">No dispersal</h3>
              
              <p>One of the odd things about the game is that it feels smaller scale than
              it is. That is, it feels company sized, but it's not, it's brigade and
              regiment sized. At a certain scale, step losses probably make more sense
              than dispersals, especially with the reorganization mechanism for
              rebuilding units.</p>
              
              <h3 id="closing-observations">Closing observations</h3>
              
              <p>Some people are bothered that one of the basic premises of the game is
              Sandinistas acting as Soviet proxies.</p>
              
              <p>I can definitely understand why this is bothersome to many people, and
              to some extent, I find it a small bit bothersome myself.</p>
              
              <p>However, this conflict with all its associated Iran-Contra drama made
              headlines for the better part of at least a couple of years. Its one of
              only a couple of topics I recall listening to on NPR pretty much daily.
              (Another being the savings and loan scandal. I was framing houses in
              Austin at the time.)</p>
              
              <p>It didn't seem to be clear to NPR what, exactly, was going on down
              there.</p>
              
              <p>So hindsight, as they say, is 20-20.</p>
              
              <p>Fast forward to now, playing what was a state-of-the-art game when it
              was published, I don't have any problem suspending disbelief.</p>
              
              <p>In fact, if CA is "fantasy," it's no more or no less fantasy than
              Victory Games popular Fleet series, which clearly (and thankfully!)
              models hypothetical conflicts.</p>
              
              <p>Here's my impression after spending a bit of time with the game:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>The rules are very clear to me, and contain a <em>lot</em> of worked
              examples. Bear in mind I do network application development for day job,
              so rules with this sort of clarity and precision are a welcome change
              from what I deal with day-to-day at work (where quality is correlated to
              WTFs/minute).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Handling insurgent activation and deactivation is critically
              important, and allows hit and run technique. <em>Poof</em> call up a unit or
              three of insurgents, do some hit and run (insurgents immune to ezocs),
              and <em>poof</em> stand them down for future reactivation. Opponent can't
              eliminate what's not on the board. CA models this much more explicitly
              than the COIN games.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>All the accounting information is on the <em>single</em> map, really
              important for me as my table is about 2' x 3' Having record tracks
              off-map is a major pain.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Mark Herman helped develop it. =)</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>CA isn't for everyone, but I like it, and as noted above, would be
              delighted to acquire a spare copy for parts.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.

                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
