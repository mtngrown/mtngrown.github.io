StarForce Scenario 1 Tactical combat at Alpha Centauri
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep  5 2014</time>

<p>Alpha Centauri (AC) forces begin Turn 1 already in the LiteZulu (LZ),
and so choose to deploy dead center of the Tactical Display: 100/0.</p>

<p>Solar Hegemony (SH) forces have to shift in on Turn 1, and choose to
enter the Tactical Display (TD) at hexes 540/0 and 541/0. (Note the
misprint "451" on the TD.)</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Turn 1 starts in the TD, and more or less defines the entire scenario:
whoever wins the tactical phase wins the game for Scenario 1. The AC
starforce is allowed to set up anywhere on the TD, chooses colocating
with the stargate.</p>

<p>The SH forces enter on hexes 541 and 540.</p>

<h3 id="tac-turn-1">Tac Turn 1</h3>

<p>Tac Turns are comprised of two phases.</p>

<h4 id="phase-1">Phase 1</h4>

<p>Once the SH forces enter the TD, they need to get close enough to the
stargate to cast. They have two choices: battle mode now, then slow
shift, or stellar shift close in, then change to battle mode. Either
way, the Tac Turn they change to battle mode leaves them vulnerable to
opposing casts. In this case, J and K change to battle mode, and L and M
stellar shift to 150/-1 and 110/+1. This costs 28 teles, leaving 4
anti-cast.</p>

<p>The AC forces could choose to be in battle mode to start, given their
location in the LZ implies 11.11 Step 3: A. In this game, the AC starts
in stellar mode. The point is probably moot, either way, unless the SH
does something really stupid (likely!), AC won't have much chance of an
effective cast.</p>

<p>The stargate can perform up to 12 casts. For this TT1, the stargate will
cast 8 points in the 1, 5 and 9 directions, both positive and negative,
for a total of 48 teles in casting, leaving 16 teles in anti-casting.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stargate to L: 8 attenuates to 4, against anti-cast 4, 0 column, result D.</li>
  <li>Stargate to M: 8 attenuates to 4, against anti-cast 4, 0 column, result D.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good work AC! Put the Sollies on the run.</p>

<h4 id="phase-2">Phase 2</h4>

<p>No starforces choose to shift this phase.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stargate to L: 8 attenuates to 4, against anti-cast 4, 0 column, result D
again, which results in R, randomized BreakOff to LZ 1722, out of play.</li>
  <li>Stargate to M: 8 attenuates to 4, against anti-cast 4, 0 column, result D,
again, which results in R, randomized to LZ 3710/+10, out of play.</li>
</ul>

<p>As it turns out, the above describes "lucky" rolls, when in fact I had
miscomputed the tac shift tele cost for L and M as 32 instead of 28.
During the game, the stargate casts were rolled on +8 instead of 0,
which is almost sure disruption. However, the next tac turn, L and M
would be helpless as they would then need to change to battle mode
leaving no teles for anti-casting. The result at the end of Tac Turn 2
would very likely be the same.</p>

<p>End of Tac Turn 1: L and M are out of play, A, J and K are in Battle
Mode.</p>

<p>Not looking good for the Solar Hegemony.</p>

<h3 id="tac-turn-2">Tac Turn 2</h3>

<p>The Alpha Centaurians are off to a commanding lead.
Let's see how they fare now the Solar Hegemony has its nose
bloodied.</p>

<h4 id="phase-1-1">Phase 1</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A: 32T to 240/0</li>
  <li>J: 56T to 341/-1, 8A.</li>
  <li>K: 56T to 332/+1, 8A</li>
  <li>SG20: 64C7p, range 3, roll on the 0 column, no effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="phase-2-1">Phase 2</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A: 16C5p, 16C5n (note: this was a blunder. Unlike stargates,
starforces are only allowed a single cast per Tac Phase).
Casting against J, 16 attenuate to 8 - 8 roll d10 for 9 on
the 0 column, D! 10% chance, great lucky roll.</li>
  <li>SG20: 64C7n, range 3, roll on the 0 column,  no effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>AC needed the lucky roll on Phase 1 with a followup to Randomize in
Phase 2. Net result, nothing, as J recovers at the end of Tac Turn 2.
Solar Hegemony is doing better.</p>

<h3 id="tac-turn-3">Tac Turn 3</h3>

<p>Nothing changed in Tac Turn 2. Let's see what Tac Turn 3 brings.</p>

<h4 id="phase-1-2">Phase 1</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A: 32T to 140/0</li>
  <li>J: 48T to 150/-1</li>
  <li>K: 48T to 130/+1</li>
  <li>SG20, casting:
    <ul>
      <li>32-C-7-n, no effect</li>
      <li>32-C-5-p, no effect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="phase-2-2">Phase 2</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A: 16-C-11-n</li>
  <li>J: 8-C-3-p, no effect even combined with K</li>
  <li>K: 8-C-3-n, no effect</li>
  <li>SG20, casting:
    <ul>
      <li>16-C-7-n combine with A, disrupt J</li>
      <li>16-C-5-p, no effect</li>
      <li>32A</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Upshot: J is disrupted in Phase 2, which doesn't really matter.</p>

<h3 id="tac-turn-4">Tac Turn 4</h3>

<p>It looks like the only way to win for the SH is using both J and K to
full blast the stargate, right away. The stargate has a couple of
options: defend at full strength both phases, or take a chance on being
able to disrupt J or K.</p>

<h4 id="phase-1-3">Phase 1</h4>

<p>J and K both commit: 64T in the appropriate direction of the stargate.
At range 1, this is 32 + 32 = 64 total on SG20, which now has a choice.
Technically, SG20 won't know what J and K are committing, if anything,
but the risk of disruption is high if SG20 doesn't provide any anti-cast
teles. The options are A64, and less than A64. In this case, let's play
a hunch that J and K are going to commit, and play the odds with two
casts, 8C in both directions.</p>

<p>Which is better?</p>

<p>Let's try both and see what happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A64: 64 - 64 = 0, 10% chance of D, roll d10 for 0, no effect.
However, it turns out a "D" result on a stargate has no effect anyway.</li>
  <li>A48: 64 - 48 = 12, 30% of an R (see note just above), roll 7, stargate
is disrupted!</li>
  <li>SG20 casting to J: on the +4 column roll d10 for 1, no effect, but it doesn't
matter because J has no more teles to spend in Phase 2.</li>
  <li>SG20 casting to K: on the +4 column roll d10 for 4, D, but again it doesn't
matter because K has no more teles to spend in Phase 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now if the SH only had the other two starforces, there would be a chance
of winning this on Tac Phase 2.</p>

<p>At this point I called the game without starforce A's cast. While A had
a pretty good chance of randomizing either J or K, it didn't matter for
this game, at this point.</p>

<h4 id="phase-2-3">Phase 2</h4>

<p>Not necessary, SH has lost.</p>

<p>AC carries the day!</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Working through a set of tactical turns was time consuming, with the
initial tac turn taking several hours of intermittent work. The sequence
of play isn't that difficult, or long, but it is <em>different</em>. Later tac
turns went much more quickly.</p>

<p>As with many other vintage wargames, there is a certain amount of
critically important record keeping necessary for game play.
The Simultaneous Movement (SiMov) ledger is critically important, and
could be improved. There is no dedicated ledger for
Tactical Turns, which differ from Stellar Turns just enough to make the
SiMov ledger annoying to use for tactical combat. A dedicated player
aid for tactical turn and combat sequencing would be nice as well.</p>

<p>A case could be made that the single Alpha Centauri starforce is already
in battle mode, instead of having to change modes on Tac Turn 1. It may
not really matter, because it's allowed to position itself anywhere in
the Tac Display, and it won't know which boundary hexes the SH is going to
occupy. The entering forces will spend the entire tac turn changing
mode.</p>

<p>There is a possibility of having the stargate disrupted in Tac Turn 4.
In this case, it might be reasonable to call it a draw.</p>

<p>The scenario description states that this is not to be considered
balanced, but I don't think it's that bad. Certainly, had the SH not
blundered into the stargate casting range quite so early, the outcome
could have been significantly different. If it is unbalanced, it's not
yet apparent to me which faction has the advantage, and how big that
advantage is. As usual, this means <em>it must be played again!</em></p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
