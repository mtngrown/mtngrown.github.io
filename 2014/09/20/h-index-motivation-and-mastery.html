H-Index, motivation and mastery
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 20 2014</time>
<p>Finding motivation is perennially difficult.</p>

<p>One way to find motivation is measuring one's effort against an external
rather than internal benchmark. One such benchmark useful benchmark is
the "h-index," which measures the count of games with plays. An h-index
of 10 means 10 different games played 10 times.</p>

<p>The notion of h-index is present in the game community. At the moment,
my h-index is 4. With a small amount of effort, it could get to 5.
Getting to 6 and beyond would take a slightly different strategy than
what I'm doing right now.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm pursuing mastery in a couple of games, and playing most
of the others once or twice. Building an h-index requires gradually
increasing both depth and breadth. Probably the best way to do this
would be to commit to playing everything I own at least once solo to get
a feel for the mechanics. If I like the game, or think it's worthwhile
in some other sense, play a couple more times, once as each side.</p>

<p>If the game inspires a desire for mastery, move it to a list of games
for multiple replays to start building depth as the next member of the
h-index list. While replaying this game, the other games can get a play
each to bump their number to support the h-index.</p>

<p>For example, to get to h-index 5, I need one more play of Battle for
Moscow, and 3 more plays of any one of a half-dozen remaining games.
I think I'll choose StarForce as the next h-index candidate.</p>

<p>Thinking about games this way drops some replays pretty much off the
list permanently. For example, The Final Frontier is a cute little game,
but not one I think I would want to play indefinitely, or even more than
once or twice more.</p>

<p>Also, h-index isn't everything. There are bound to be a large number of games
which are worth playing once or twice, and they should be. Examples here
include Duel on the Steppe, the S&amp;T Tobruk game which is currently
unpunched, probably most of the OCS games as lengthy play time simply
doesn't support large numbers of replays.</p>

<p>Games that will support it include everything in the PanzerBlitz family,
and Tobruk (Tank Battles), the Ogre family, VPG's States of Siege games,
fast playing games such as Chadwick's Battle for Moscow.</p>

<p>Other games such as Starship Troopers fit somewhere in the middle. It
has seven scenarios, which would be fun to play, but possibly not much
long term replay value solo.</p>

<p>Building an h-index isn't unlike building a resume. Resume building gets
an undeservedly bad rap.  While it's true that "resume building" may
have a connotation of empty achievement, this doesn't have to the case.
Approached correctly, resume building provides a wonderful way to stay
interested and motivated in an activity, while ensuring what you're
doing is meaningful and relevant. Likewise, filling an h-index with
games of no substance has little value, while using an h-index to
provide motivation for mastery has great value.</p>

<h3 id="skill-building">Skill building</h3>

<p>I have a few oddball games such as Chad and Nicaragua, with Tito and
Warsaw Rising on the way, that seem to have been games which did not
quite hit the mark, despite being historically significant and
interesting. I'm considering adding these to my h-index efforts as part
of a redevelopment investigation. Why did these games not work?  What
could be done to make them work better? Is it worth the effort, and why?
Since I haven't gotten any of these to the table yet, it's not worth
writing much more. If I do put in the effort, it will require dozens of
plays for each game.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
