                H-Index, motivation and mastery
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 20 2014</time>
              <p>Finding motivation is perennially difficult.</p>
              
              <p>One way to find motivation is measuring one's effort against an external
              rather than internal benchmark. One such benchmark useful benchmark is
              the "h-index," which measure the count of games with plays. An h-index
              of 10 means 10 different games played 10 times.</p>
              
              <p>The notion of h-index is present in the game community. At the moment,
              my h-index is 4. With a small amount of effort, it could get to 5.
              Getting to 6 and beyond would take a slightly different strategy than
              what I'm doing right now.</p>
              
              <p>Currently, I'm pursuing mastery in a couple of games, and playing most
              of the others once or twice. Building an h-index requires gradually
              increasing both depth and breadth. Probably the best way to do this
              would be to commit to playing everything I own at least once solo to get
              a feel for the mechanics. If I like the game, or think it's worthwhile
              in some other sense, play a couple more times, once as each side.</p>
              
              <p>If the game inspires a desire for mastery, move it to a list of games
              for multiple replays to start building depth as the next member of the
              h-index list. While replaying this game, the other games can get a play
              each to bump their number to support the h-index.</p>
              
              <p>For example, to get to h-index 5, I need one more play of Battle for
              Moscow, and 3 more plays of any one of a half-dozen remaining games.
              I think I'll choose StarForce as the next h-index candidate.</p>
              
              <p>Thinking about games this way drops some replays pretty much off the
              list permanently. For example, The Final Frontier is a cute little game,
              but not one I think I would want to play indefinitely, or even more than
              once or twice more.</p>
              
              <p>Also, h-index isn't everything. There are bound to be a large number of games
              which are worth playing once or twice, and they should be. Examples here
              include Duel on the Steppe, the S&amp;T Tobruk game which is currently
              unpunched, probably most of the OCS games as lengthy play time simply
              doesn't support large numbers of replays.</p>
              
              <p>Games that will support it include everything in the PanzerBlitz family,
              and Tobruk (Tank Battles), the Ogre family, VPG's States of Siege games,
              fast playing games such as Chadwick's Battle for Moscow.</p>
              
              <p>Other games such as Starship Troopers fit somewhere in the middle. It
              has seven scenarios, which would be fun to play, but possibly not much
              long term replay value solo.</p>
              
              <p>Building an h-index isn't unlike building a resume. Resume building gets
              an undeservedly bad rap.  While it's true that "resume building" may
              have a connotation of empty achievement, this doesn't have to the case.
              Approached correctly, resume building provides a wonderful way to stay
              interested and motivated in an activity, while ensuring what you're
              doing is meaningful and relevant. Likewise, filling an h-index with
              games of no substance has little value, while using an h-index to
              provide motivation for mastery has great value.</p>
              
              <h3 id="skill-building">Skill building</h3>
              
              <p>I have a few oddball games such as Chad and Nicaragua, with Tito and
              Warsaw Rising on the way, that seem to have been games which did not
              quite hit the mark, despite being historically significant and
              interesting. I'm considering adding these to my h-index efforts as part
              of a redevelopment investigation. Why did these games not work?  What
              could be done to make them work better? Is it worth the effort, and why?
              Since I haven't gotten any of these to the table yet, it's not worth
              writing much more. If I do put in the effort, it will require dozens of
              plays for each game.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.

              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
