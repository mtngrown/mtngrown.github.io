                Human League Rising
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 27 2014</time>
              <p>The main goal for this game is digging into the mechanics of shifting,
              especially Enhanced and Enhanced Gate shifting, both of which provide
              increased range, but also require thinking ahead to carefully place
              shift enhancing starforces. Tough to do in 3D on a flat piece of paper.</p>
              
              <p>I'm reexamining combat as well, because I'm pretty sure I've been "Doing
              It Wrong" somehow, to be expected from lack of experience.</p>
              
              <p>The Basic Combat rules will be used for this game. A future game will
              explore how the Advanced Combat rules play out.</p>
              
              <h2 id="scenario-background">Scenario background</h2>
              
              <p>Scenario 3 follows Scenario 2 in the timeline, postulating the Solar
              Hegemony collapsed and was replaced by the Pan-Human Hegemony. Humans
              being what they are, friction with the Human League ensure hostilities
              continued.</p>
              
              <p>The PHH player has Sol and Alpha Centauri, and is using the blue
              counters in the following screenshots. The Human League is using the tan
              counters.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p>The Pan-Human Hegemony (PHH) makes a Gate Shift from Alpha Centauri to
              Epsilon Indi, it's a single shift, total no brainer to pick up a first
              victory condition.</p>
              
              <p>The Human League (HL)</p>
              
              <p>Here's what it looks like at the end of Turn 1:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Situation at the end of Turn
              1" src="/images/starforce/starforce_scenario_3_turn_1.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>For some reason, it seems to be really difficult to get a good photo of
              the StarForce map under plexi in any lighting conditions. I'll keep
              trying.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
              
              <p>Hl and PHH are jockeying for position, getting starforces in range of
              enemy gates to ensure overwhelming combat.</p>
              
              <p>At the end of Turn 2:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Situation at the end of Turn
              2" src="/images/starforce/scenario_3_turn_2.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Is the Human League really going after Sol? Or is that just a feint when
              the real target is Alpha Centauri?</p>
              
              <p>This scenario feels like it has a lot of replay value.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
              
              <p>Setting up for some combat. Note the PHH is positioned to accept an
              Enhanced Shift from starforces A and B.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Situation at the end of Turn
              3" src="/images/starforce/scenario_3_turn_3.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Combat looks likely next turn. Modulo breakoffs, Turn 4 might be the
              last turn. Or, the invading starforces may all get wiped out and no
              gates taken at all. We'll see.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>
              
              <p>Looks like the Human League faked out the PHH after all, and will be
              attempting to neutralize Alpha Centauri.</p>
              
              <p>The PHH is definitely attempting Epsilon Eridani, they can't get
              anywhere else within the next turn.</p>
              
              <p>Here's what it looks like before combat gets under way:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Turn
              4 after shifting, before combat" src="/images/starforce/scenario_3_turn_4.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Time for combat. As noted at the beginning, this is Basic Game rules.</p>
              
              <h3 id="combat-at-alpha-centauri">Combat at Alpha Centauri</h3>
              
              <p>That's 4 HL starforces against a starforce and stargate at Alpha
              Centauri.</p>

              resident with one shifting in for defenders (2x3 + 2 = 8 in Segment 1),
              and 4 PHH starforces attacking.</p>
              
              <p>This should be a roughly even match.</p>

              <p>That was nasty. It could have gone either way, but the PHH should also
              have a slight statistical advantage. Trading losses 1 for 1 is a bad
              deal for the attacker in this case, as the star gate just sits there
              grinding down the attackers.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>Clear win for Human League, in part due to a large number of 6s rolled
              when outnumbered at Epsilon Eridani, which chewed away at the PHH
              starforces 1 at a time. That 9 for the HL was pretty helpful too.
              It went 5 combat segments, and the last of 4 PHH
              forces was in breakoff mode, but still was lost. It was just a bad day
              for the Pan-Human Hegemony. Murphy must have brought his whole family.</p>
              
              <p>The next time I play this either solo or as the PHH, I'm not going for
              Epsilon Indi right away. I'll deal with that later, after reducing some
              HL starforces and neutralizing an HL gate.</p>
              
              <p>I really like this game. The mechanics are simple, but the decisions are
              truly agonizing.</p>
              
              <p>StarForce would be a <em>fantastic</em> game to umpire for people playing
              double blind. I believe I'd want some sort of intelligence capability
              though, such that at least some of the enemy OOB was exposed.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.

              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
