<p>StarSoldier is "Volume 2" of SPI's StarForce Trilogy. Over the next few
days, I'll be going through the rule book to learn the mechanics,
without getting into serious gameplay. That said, some sort of game will get
played.</p>

<p>The first thing I like to do when looking at a new game is throw some
counters on the board and push them around. The counters from Scenario 1
will do just fine.</p>

<p>First, which is what.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Humans are the blue counters, and there should be 29 of them.</li>
  <li>L'Chal Dah are green counters, and there should be 25 of them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's dig a little deeper into the mechanics.</p>

<h2 id="fire-combat">Fire combat</h2>

<p>The next obvious thing (for me) is figuring out how to blow stuff up.
The best way I know how to do that is put a couple of soldiers on the
map and have them shoot at each other.</p>

<p>Attack strength = 3 x 2 = 6. Defense strength = 2RA + 2CM x 2 + 6
(terrain) = 12</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ss203 (EE)</li>
</ul>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Attack strength = 3TP x 2 = 6. Defense strength = 2RA + 2CM x 2 + 3
(organic cover)  = 9.</p>

<p>As it turns out, AS - DS &lt;= 0 for both units, hence, no fire.</p>

<p>DF stands for Direct Fire, CM for Counter Measures which will add to the
effective defense strength, RA for Range Attenuation.</p>

<p>We're ready to play through Scenario 1.</p>

<h2 id="scenario-1-the-epsilon-eridane-campaign">Scenario 1 The Epsilon Eridane Campaign</h2>

<p>Scenario 1 is a human-human engagement pitting the Solar Hegemony
against the Epsilon Eridane. The SH will be the Alpha Force,
the Epsilon Eridane the Bravo force. This scenario is specified to use
the Patrol Situation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solar Hegemony, Alpha: 1 squad</li>
  <li>Epsilon Eridane, Bravo: 1 fire team, 1 heavy weapons section</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Special Rules</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>All urban areas treated as organic cover.</li>
  <li>Epsilon Eridane is allowed Orbital Ground Support, maximum <strong>per turn</strong>:
  * 4 Orbital Bombardment Explosives,
  * 2 Orbital Laser Barrages,
  * 2 Orbital Opcaity Bombs.</li>
  <li>No homing missiles for either side.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="more-about-the-patrol-situation">More about the Patrol Situation</h3>

<p>In the Patrol Situation, a base is defined to exist off the east or the
west edge of the map, whence the Bravo force sets up on the map and the
Alpha force enters the map on the opposite side of the base.</p>

<p>In this case, because my game table is roughly 2' by 3', and I have no
convenient place for record tracks, the Alpha Force (SH) will enter the
north edge of the map, with the base off map to the south. The record
tracks go under plexiglas on the western half of the map, leaving the
eastern half for game play.</p>

<p><strong>Patrol-specific Rules</strong></p>

<p>Although StarSoldiers uses a simultaneous movement system, since the
Bravo Force (EE) is already deployed, the first turn is the Alpha force
moving on to the map. In the Patrol Situation, <em>Alpha can only task
movement (MV) and countermeasures (CM) on entry</em>.</p>

<p>Alpha may enter the map in any mode.</p>

<p><strong>Patrol victory conditions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Alpha:
    <ul>
      <li>2 points for every Task Point loss in PL of Bravo force;</li>
      <li>10 point for every starsoldier exited from map</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bravo:
    <ul>
      <li>3 points for every Task Point loss on Alpha's Preservation Level.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setting-up">Setting up</h3>

<p>Typically, I spend a lot of time setting up solitaire games so that I
can get a feel for the system. Part of the setting up process often
involves taking detailed notes while setting up the game, and photos and
locations of units at setup.</p>

<p>This is in part to provide a record of what I did, in part to allow
replaying the same situation exactly in the future, and in part to allow
tearing the game down after the initial setup to use the table for
something else. Perhaps a different game. In any case, recording the
setup in detail allows play to proceed in stages. Sometimes, by the time
I've set everything up and written it all down, I'm bored and want to
examine a different game.</p>

<p>There is a <em>lot</em> of record keeping in StarSoldier, and it doesn't look
like the fun kind. I don't necessarily have much of a problem with that,
but it makes it hard to find opponents.</p>

<p>The first task is assigning "serial numbers" to each starsoldier such
that their Task Points can be tracked.</p>

<p><strong>House Rule</strong> because the map is "short," Force Bravo will set up on
the map first, and the Alpha Force will enter with 9 task
points. This will allow for a positioning move, which is mostly to help
me wrap my head around the mechanics. Here's what it looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/starsoldier/situation_1_setup.jpg" alt="After initial &quot;emplacement&quot; move for Situation
1" /></p>

<p>Note the star soldier record tracks are under the plexi with the
counters riding on top just as the playing pieces. This is a consequence
of having a very small playing area.</p>

<p>The actual locations are listed below:</p>

<p>Time to play the game.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>(November 1, 2014)</p>

<p>As it turns out, further reading of the rules indicates I've set this up
as a Recon scenario rather than a Patrol scenario. My intention was to
speed up the game play a bit by emplacing the EE forces. But that
changes the balance of the scenario, as all the EE forces got put into
defensible positions.</p>

<p>Another thing I intended was to provide a selection of activities for
each unit on the Alpha team, then select at random. This was too much
work. I don't know the game well enough to evaluate "good" versus "bad"
moves, at least anything more than staying in cover and out of the
clear.</p>

<p>Here's something else interesting: there is no combined fire. Each
unit's attacks are resolved one at a time.</p>

<p>Here's the Solar Hegemony plan:</p>

<h3 id="resolving-direct-fire-attacks">Resolving direct fire attacks</h3>

<p>(November 2, 2014)</p>

<p>Computing attack factors is easy: \(AF = TP \times ER\).</p>

<p>Computing defense factor \(DF\) is a little more involved:</p>

<p>\(DF = A_T + A_R + A_M + A_{CM}\),</p>

<p>where \(A_T\) is the attenuation due to terrain, \(A_R\) is the
attenuation due to range, \(A_M\) is the attenuation due to movement,
and \(A_{CM} = CM \times ER\) is the attenuation from the target's
countermeasures.</p>

<p>\(AF = 6\) for all attacking units. As noted above, there is no combined
fire effect in this game, attacks are resolved individually, for each
unit firing. It turns out that \(DF &gt; 6\) for all Solar Hegemony units,
hence, no combat occurs.</p>

<p>I wrote out tables for all seven EE units firing, but the tables are too
wide to fit into a browser screen. We'll examine one combat in detail
which differs mostly in range attenuation from the others.</p>

<p>Ss201 in hex 0544 fires on hex 2137 containing Hw121 at High Altitude
with 3 TP at 2 ER for \(AF = 6\). In defense we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Range 17 + 5 (HA) yields \(A_R = 3\).</li>
  <li>Hw121 allocated 1 TP to movement, resulting in \(A_M = 1\).</li>
  <li>High Altitude gives \(A_T = 1\).</li>
  <li>Hw121 allocated \(CM = 5\), with \(ER = 1\) because of movement,
yielding \(A_{CM} = 5\).</li>
  <li>Total \(DF = 10\).</li>
</ul>

<p>This results in combat differential \(\Delta = AF - DF = 6 - 10 = -4\),
no combat allowed.</p>

<p>It looks like if I want to actually damage another unit, I'm going to
have to be willing to spend enough Task Points to risk taking
considerable damage myself. Devious.</p>

<p>Here's the end of Turn 1:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/starsoldier/scenario_1_game_1_turn_1.jpg" alt="End of Turn 1" /></p>

<p>The Solar Hegemony really ought to be making a beeline for the south
edge of the map, but they are staying in cover as much as possible along
the way.</p>

<p>Score: SH 0, EE 0.</p>

<p>The Solar Hegemony really gets hurt. This is the consequence of allowing
the EE to set up in advance on the high ground. Very difficult for the
SH to hurt the EE. Also, the EE have 3 Hw units, which double the ER on
direct and opportunity fire. Yikes!</p>

<p>Score: EE 70, SH 0.</p>

<p>So far, so good. But this game could really use some decent player's
aids.</p>

<p>As I worked my way through Turn 1, my impression was that the rules of
the game aren't that difficult, and there aren't that many, but the
number of choices available for each unit feels large. Several kinds
of movement, several types of fire, several types of weapons, all add to
an excellent recipe for analysis paralysis.</p>

<p>These types of games are best learned either solo, or with someone at an
equal level of skill. Otherwise, the more experienced player is likely
to get really, really bored.</p>

<p>On the other hand, StarSoldier and StarForce are difficult to <em>play</em>
solo, because the dominant mechanism in both games is the Simultaneous
Movement, which induces a huge element of uncertainty difficult to
recreate when playing solo. One way to get that uncertainty back is to
draft two or more possible moves for each faction on each turn, then
resolve the which set of moves is used at random. Easier said than done,
and proved to be too much burden for the first turn.</p>

<p>Player aids:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Record sheets similar to Starship Troopers would be much easier to
handle than counters on a track.</li>
  <li>At least two different ledgers, one for tasking, and one for fire. The
mechanisms are very simple, keeping track of what's going on is
difficult.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
