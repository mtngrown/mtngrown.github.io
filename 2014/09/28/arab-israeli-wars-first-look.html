Arab Israeli Wars first look
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 28 2014</time>
<p>I have an opponent for plyaing this game in the future, so I'm going
through the first scenario solo to learn the basic rules.</p>

<p>Situation B-1 (B for Basic) models a clash of armor as the Israeli 7th
Armored Brigade is intercepted by the Egyptian 1st Armored Brigade.</p>

<p>The scenario as written is felt to be unbalanced in favor of the
Israelis, at 15 turns with the given victory conditions. The Israelis
definitely have much better armor on average, with longer range, better
guns, and better ability to fire in hull-down positions. The Egyptians
have more tanks.</p>

<p>Over the first 6 turns, the Egyptians seem to be all 5s and 6s at 3:1
and 4:1 odds. They just cannot get a break against the Israeli armor,
which is systemically dismantling them.</p>

<p>This continued through the next several turns, where the Egyptians
continued to roll 5 and 6s. They did, however, manage to score 1 direct
fire kill, and another kill on an already dispersed Israeli unit with a
roll of 5, yielding a DD.</p>

<p>Final scoring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Israeli: 4 kills for 8 points + 4 units exited = 12.</li>
  <li>Egyptian: 2 kills for 4 points, 6 Israelis on the board = 10.</li>
</ul>

<p>Israeli win, no surprise, and the margin would increase had the
next 6 turns played out, modulo stupendous bad luck on Israeli rolls,
coupled with stupendous good luck on Egyptian rolls.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I called this game at Turn 9, in part because I could see there really
wasn't possibility of an Egyptian win under the original scenario
victory conditions.</p>

<p>Another reason I called it was other players recommend playing B-1 8
turns, and scoring Egyptian VPs as 3 points per Israeli unit eliminated.
I wanted to score it up and see how it worked. In this case, it would
have been a tie game. Given the ridiculously bad Egyptian rolls, it
looks like it would be challenging for the Israelis to win in 8 turns.
Which brings Situation B-1 right back into balance.</p>

<p>Overall, I <em>really</em> like this game. The tank on tank action in the open
feels a lot more like Ogre than like PanzerBlitz, where there are always
line of sight and slope issues to contend with. And that damnable
Russian infantry, none here.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<p>Learning a new game always results in blunders as rules are overlooked,
ignored or forgotten.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Not</em> subtracting 1 from die rolled against already dispersed
opponents. This probably benefitted the Israelis at least once. As it
turns out, I always forget about this in PanzerBlitz as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably more, but I'll have to play again after another rules reread.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
