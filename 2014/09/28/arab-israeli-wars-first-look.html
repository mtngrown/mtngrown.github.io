                Arab Israeli Wars first look
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 28 2014</time>
              <p>I have an opponent for plyaing this game in the future, so I'm going
              through the first scenario solo to learn the basic rules.</p>
              
              <p>Situation B-1 (B for Basic) models a clash of armor as the Israeli 7th
              Armored Brigade is intercepted by the Egyptian 1st Armored Brigade.</p>
              
              <p>The scenario as written is felt to be unbalanced in favor of the
              Israelis, at 15 turns with the given victory conditions. The Israelis
              definitely have much better armor on average, with longer range, better
              guns, and better ability to fire in hull-down positions. The Egyptians
              have more tanks.</p>
              
              <p>Over the first 6 turns, the Egyptians seem to be all 5s and 6s at 3:1
              and 4:1 odds. They just cannot get a break against the Israeli armor,
              which is systemically dismantling them.</p>
              
              <p>This continued through the next several turns, where the Egyptians
              continued to roll 5 and 6s. They did, however, manage to score 1 direct
              fire kill, and another kill on an already dispersed Israeli unit with a
              roll of 5, yielding a DD.</p>
              
              <p>Final scoring:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Israeli: 4 kills for 8 points + 4 units exited = 12.</li>
                <li>Egyptian: 2 kills for 4 points, 6 Israelis on the board = 10.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Israeli win, no surprise, and the margin would increase had the
              next 6 turns played out, modulo stupendous bad luck on Israeli rolls,
              coupled with stupendous good luck on Egyptian rolls.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>I called this game at Turn 9, in part because I could see there really
              wasn't possibility of an Egyptian win under the original scenario
              victory conditions.</p>
              
              <p>Another reason I called it was other players recommend playing B-1 8
              turns, and scoring Egyptian VPs as 3 points per Israeli unit eliminated.
              I wanted to score it up and see how it worked. In this case, it would
              have been a tie game. Given the ridiculously bad Egyptian rolls, it
              looks like it would be challenging for the Israelis to win in 8 turns.
              Which brings Situation B-1 right back into balance.</p>
              
              <p>Overall, I <em>really</em> like this game. The tank on tank action in the open
              feels a lot more like Ogre than like PanzerBlitz, where there are always
              line of sight and slope issues to contend with. And that damnable
              Russian infantry, none here.</p>
              
              <h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>
              
              <p>Learning a new game always results in blunders as rules are overlooked,
              ignored or forgotten.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><em>Not</em> subtracting 1 from die rolled against already dispersed
              opponents. This probably benefitted the Israelis at least once. As it
              turns out, I always forget about this in PanzerBlitz as well.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Probably more, but I'll have to play again after another rules reread.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
