<p>(<em>Note: I played reserve offensives as guaranteed success in this game,
which is wrong. Reserve offensive only allow the opportunity to roll
again.</em>)</p>

<p>This was a notable game, starting from the first card.</p>

<div>
8. Bukharin fights! Crazy that this is the first card.

<br />

20.

<br />

27. German Capitulation! Dawn cards already. This is crazy, all the
    cards are in play by Turn 4. This might be an interesting game.

<br />

57. Removed Southern Front from play. Awesome.

<br />

3. Need to drive baltic back from Petrograd, took 3 rolls to go back 2
box. This could have been game ending.

<br />

11. Baltic back to 3.

<br />

23. Attack Eastern, no effect.

<br />

4. No effects.

<br />

32. Baltic is killing me this game

<br />

5. Good rolls, pushed back some fronts.

<br />

42. Baltic back 2, regained political dissent loss.

<br />

52.

<br />

29. +2 drm against baltic, yes please.

<br />

1. Allies back to Archangel.

<br />

56. Drive on Eastern Front succeeds, back to Omsk.

<br />

33. Whiffed

<br />

24. Whiffed

<br />

26. +1 for Reorganization, roll 5, 5, Communist Subversion, Actions before
    Events. I don't know how to play this yet, but I suspect it's quite
    powerful if used correctly.  This is cool because it won't expire,
    we're already in Dawn Epoch.

    Poland and Eastern driven back.

<br />

50. Allies advance, then driven back to Archangel.

<br />

21. Czar's Fate! And Eastern is in Ekaterinburg! Oh noes! But. But
but but, the communists are subverting, hence, I can play the
actions before the events. I'll play a Reserve Offensive first
to frive Eastern to Omsk, then get +1 drm on all other
offensives. I do need to watch my political track though. Allies
back to Archangel, whiffed a political roll.

<br />

13. Eastern and Poland back.

<br />

51. Bad luck! Curzon line activated. Whiffed two political
rolls. Maybe one political roll succeeded in this game so
far. Mote than half through the cards though.

<br />

44. Drive Eastern off the board: subversion scores again.
Roll 6 to get to Omsk, play reserve to Irkutsk. Also,
drive Baltic back from Petrograd, that would be bad if
it advanced into Moscow.

<br />

49. Polish advance on Lvov, political point list.
Bummer. Allies driven back from Vologda to Lake
Onega.

<br />

25. Baltic advance into Moscow from
    Petrograd...except subversion. Roll 6, it moves
    back to Pskov, then advance back to Petrograd.
    As long as I have reserves, I can work with
    this. And Finland is removed.

<br />

59. Poland is off the map with roll 5! Now to
focus on Allies and controlling Baltic.

<br />

7. Push Allies back to Archangel.

<br />

12. Baltic back to Pskov.

<br />

40. No op, Southern is off the map.

<br />

43. Time to get Allies off map. Roll 6, spend
reserve offensive and the Allies are sent packing.
Political roll 2. Cripes.

<br />

46. Petrograd fortified, take that Baltic.

<br />

60. Baltic is contained, 4 actions available on
this turn. Roll politics: 2, 1, 2, 3. Dang.

<br />

35. All active fronts advance, which means
Baltic, except that it rolled 5, so too bad,
stay in Pskov you losers.

<br />

54. Political roll succeeds, now at 3 with
both reserves available.

<br />

6. Baltic advance, but no offensives
 allowed. Too bad their still stuck
 inPskov. Losers. Political now at 4.

<br />

15. Baltic back to Estonia.

<br />

47. Another Baltic advance, but +1 drm
with 2 actions; back to Estonia.

<br />

17. A nasty card, but +1 on Reorg roll.
Let's try it: nada.

<br />

14. 4 actions! Baltic back to Estonia,
Political back to 4.

<br />

30. Political roll fest: 1, boo. Action:
   Baltic back to Riga. If I get through
   thenext couple of cards, should be a
   military win.

<br />

41. Political dissent roll: add one
for Political at 5.

<br />

53. Political: whiffed.

<br />

22. Lose 1 political, boohoo, advance
1 political on roll.

<br />

55. Political at 6, now 7.

<br />

2. Political at 8.

<br />

34. +1 drm for reorg, yes! Another
Communist Subversion, whatever.

<br />

16. Last card, military victory,
first time for me.
</div>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 fronts removed times 6 points
each: 30.</li>
  <li>Political: 8.</li>
  <li>Available resources, 4 times 2: 8.</li>
  <li>Baltic in Riga: 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: 50.</p>

<p>International Victory!</p>

<p>As noted above, I broke at least one rule by playing the Reserve
Offensives as guaranteed success rather than rolling as usual.</p>

<p>However, this does show how it's possible to win, because I believe the
technique is viable: drive the offensive back and get them off the board
early. Having the subversion capability was extremely helpful.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
