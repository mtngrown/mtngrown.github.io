                Great Soviet International Victory

              <p>(<em>Note: I played reserve offensives as guaranteed success in this game,
              which is wrong. Reserve offensive only allow the opportunity to roll
              again.</em>)</p>
              
              <p>This was a notable game, starting from the first card.</p>
              
              <div>
              8. Bukharin fights! Crazy that this is the first card.
              
              <br />
              
              20.
              
              <br />
              
              27. German Capitulation! Dawn cards already. This is crazy, all the
                  cards are in play by Turn 4. This might be an interesting game.
              
              <br />
              
              57. Removed Southern Front from play. Awesome.
              
              <br />
              
              3. Need to drive baltic back from Petrograd, took 3 rolls to go back 2
              box. This could have been game ending.
              
              <br />
              
              11. Baltic back to 3.
              
              <br />
              
              23. Attack Eastern, no effect.
              
              <br />
              
              4. No effects.
              
              <br />
              
              32. Baltic is killing me this game
              
              <br />
              
              5. Good rolls, pushed back some fronts.
              
              <br />
              
              42. Baltic back 2, regained political dissent loss.
              
              <br />
              
              52.
              
              <br />
              
              29. +2 drm against baltic, yes please.
              
              <br />
              
              1. Allies back to Archangel.
              
              <br />
              
              56. Drive on Eastern Front succeeds, back to Omsk.
              
              <br />
              
              33. Whiffed
              
              <br />
              
              24. Whiffed
              
              <br />
              
              26. +1 for Reorganization, roll 5, 5, Communist Subversion, Actions before
                  Events. I don't know how to play this yet, but I suspect it's quite
                  powerful if used correctly.  This is cool because it won't expire,
                  we're already in Dawn Epoch.
              
                  Poland and Eastern driven back.
              
              <br />
              
              50. Allies advance, then driven back to Archangel.
              
              <br />
              
              21. Czar's Fate! And Eastern is in Ekaterinburg! Oh noes! But. But
              but but, the communists are subverting, hence, I can play the
              actions before the events. I'll play a Reserve Offensive first
              to frive Eastern to Omsk, then get +1 drm on all other
              offensives. I do need to watch my political track though. Allies
              back to Archangel, whiffed a political roll.
              
              <br />
              
              13. Eastern and Poland back.
              
              <br />
              
              51. Bad luck! Curzon line activated. Whiffed two political
              rolls. Maybe one political roll succeeded in this game so
              far. Mote than half through the cards though.
              
              <br />
              
              44. Drive Eastern off the board: subversion scores again.
              Roll 6 to get to Omsk, play reserve to Irkutsk. Also,
              drive Baltic back from Petrograd, that would be bad if
              it advanced into Moscow.
              
              <br />
              
              49. Polish advance on Lvov, political point list.
              Bummer. Allies driven back from Vologda to Lake
              Onega.
              
              <br />
              
              25. Baltic advance into Moscow from
                  Petrograd...except subversion. Roll 6, it moves
                  back to Pskov, then advance back to Petrograd.
                  As long as I have reserves, I can work with
                  this. And Finland is removed.
              
              <br />
              
              59. Poland is off the map with roll 5! Now to
              focus on Allies and controlling Baltic.
              
              <br />
              
              7. Push Allies back to Archangel.
              
              <br />
              
              12. Baltic back to Pskov.
              
              <br />
              
              40. No op, Southern is off the map.
              
              <br />
              
              43. Time to get Allies off map. Roll 6, spend
              reserve offensive and the Allies are sent packing.
              Political roll 2. Cripes.
              
              <br />
              
              46. Petrograd fortified, take that Baltic.
              
              <br />
              
              60. Baltic is contained, 4 actions available on
              this turn. Roll politics: 2, 1, 2, 3. Dang.
              
              <br />
              
              35. All active fronts advance, which means
              Baltic, except that it rolled 5, so too bad,
              stay in Pskov you losers.
              
              <br />
              
              54. Political roll succeeds, now at 3 with
              both reserves available.
              
              <br />
              
              6. Baltic advance, but no offensives
               allowed. Too bad their still stuck
               inPskov. Losers. Political now at 4.
              
              <br />
              
              15. Baltic back to Estonia.
              
              <br />
              
              47. Another Baltic advance, but +1 drm
              with 2 actions; back to Estonia.
              
              <br />
              
              17. A nasty card, but +1 on Reorg roll.
              Let's try it: nada.
              
              <br />
              
              14. 4 actions! Baltic back to Estonia,
              Political back to 4.
              
              <br />
              
              30. Political roll fest: 1, boo. Action:
                 Baltic back to Riga. If I get through
                 thenext couple of cards, should be a
                 military win.
              
              <br />
              
              41. Political dissent roll: add one
              for Political at 5.
              
              <br />
              
              53. Political: whiffed.
              
              <br />
              
              22. Lose 1 political, boohoo, advance
              1 political on roll.
              
              <br />
              
              55. Political at 6, now 7.
              
              <br />
              
              2. Political at 8.
              
              <br />
              
              34. +1 drm for reorg, yes! Another
              Communist Subversion, whatever.
              
              <br />
              
              16. Last card, military victory,
              first time for me.

              <p>As noted above, I broke at least one rule by playing the Reserve
              Offensives as guaranteed success rather than rolling as usual.</p>
              
              <p>However, this does show how it's possible to win, because I believe the
              technique is viable: drive the offensive back and get them off the board
              early. Having the subversion capability was extremely helpful.</p>
