Flash Point Fire Rescue first play
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov  1 2014</time>
<p>Work is really heavy on my mind at the moment. I don't have the mental
energy to set up something heavier like a wargame. Even light wargames
are far heavier than most other games.</p>

<p>Today I decided to break out Flash Point, one of the first (if not the
first) "real" game I purchase a couple of years ago. I wanted to get
Pandemic as I had just played it at the time, but the game store didn't
have it in stock. They recommended Flash Point.</p>

<p>I took it home, but did no more than rip the shrink off. Didn't even
punch the pieces. Hence, a perfect game for today. While I'd prefer to
play this with other people, I do like learning the rules on my own in
advance. Just seems to work out better that way.</p>

<p>Per the rules recommendation, I set up the "Family Game" to teach
myself. This is a simpler stripped down scenario. I decided not to take
copious notes on this game, instead, just focus on the game play and
understanding how the rules work. To keep it simple, I chose to use 1
firefighter, the red one of course.</p>

<h2 id="a-surprise-win-for-game-1">A surprise win for Game 1</h2>

<p>Given that I wasn't "playing for a win" it's a bit surprising that a
single firefighter was able to win it. The results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>14 damage markers placed,</li>
  <li>25 fires on the board,</li>
  <li>7 rescued,</li>
  <li>1 lost on a flashover, which turned out to be a false alarm victim.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what it looked like at the end of the game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/flash_point_game_1_end.jpg" alt="Flash Point 1 firefighter win" /></p>

<p>I'd say I got pretty lucky on this game. The fire advances and POI
placements all turned out to be pretty convenient for my firefighter
running around.  The dice could have just as easily knocked me off the
board 2 or 3 times.  It feels like the board was 2 or 3 turns away from
going totally nuts.</p>

<p>The new iPhone 6+ takes much better pictures than the old 3G I used to
have.</p>

<h2 id="upshot">Upshot</h2>

<p>Flash Point "Family Game" plays fast and easy. I can see the appeal. The
basic mechanics admit a lot of chrome, that's evident from even a single
play. I'll definitely be playing this again, and hopefully with some
others for coop play.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
