                Flash Point Fire Rescue first play
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov  1 2014</time>
              <p>Work is really heavy on my mind at the moment. I don't have the mental
              energy to set up something heavier like a wargame. Even light wargames
              are far heavier than most other games.</p>
              
              <p>Today I decided to break out Flash Point, one of the first (if not the
              first) "real" game I purchase a couple of years ago. I wanted to get
              Pandemic as I had just played it at the time, but the game store didn't
              have it in stock. They recommended Flash Point.</p>
              
              <p>I took it home, but did no more than rip the shrink off. Didn't even
              punch the pieces. Hence, a perfect game for today. While I'd prefer to
              play this with other people, I do like learning the rules on my own in
              advance. Just seems to work out better that way.</p>
              
              <p>Per the rules recommendation, I set up the "Family Game" to teach
              myself. This is a simpler stripped down scenario. I decided not to take
              copious notes on this game, instead, just focus on the game play and
              understanding how the rules work. To keep it simple, I chose to use 1
              firefighter, the red one of course.</p>
              
              <h2 id="a-surprise-win-for-game-1">A surprise win for Game 1</h2>
              
              <p>Given that I wasn't "playing for a win" it's a bit surprising that a
              single firefighter was able to win it. The results:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>14 damage markers placed,</li>
                <li>25 fires on the board,</li>
                <li>7 rescued,</li>
                <li>1 lost on a flashover, which turned out to be a false alarm victim.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Here's what it looked like at the end of the game:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Flash Point 1 firefighter win" src="/images/flash_point_game_1_end.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>I'd say I got pretty lucky on this game. The fire advances and POI
              placements all turned out to be pretty convenient for my firefighter
              running around.  The dice could have just as easily knocked me off the
              board 2 or 3 times.  It feels like the board was 2 or 3 turns away from
              going totally nuts.</p>
              
              <p>The new iPhone 6+ takes much better pictures than the old 3G I used to
              have.</p>
              
              <h2 id="upshot">Upshot</h2>
              
              <p>Flash Point "Family Game" plays fast and easy. I can see the appeal. The
              basic mechanics admit a lot of chrome, that's evident from even a single
              play. I'll definitely be playing this again, and hopefully with some
              others for coop play.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.

                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
