                Solo learning
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov  2 2014</time>
              <p>Since you askedâ€¦</p>
              
              <p>I just don't worry about it, not even a little bit.</p>
              
              <p>This may be a result of programming web applications for a living, where
              almost every day finds an opportunity to practice humility. Also known
              as having one's face shoved into a steaming pile of ignorance.</p>
              
              <p>As a result, I don't expect to get the rules right. In fact, I expect to
              get them wrong, if not laughably wrong.</p>
              
              <p>For example, I just wrapped up my first game of StarSoldier (solo), a
              vintage game from the Redmond Simonsen stable, for which scenarios
              should be fairly well-balanced. I managed to score 70 to 20, where a
              decisive win is 26+. Obviously, I did something really, really wrong.
              Most likely, several things, as I can think of a couple right off the
              top of my head.</p>
              
              <p>This is fine, not a problem at all.</p>
              
              <p>There is this notion in software that one should work as hard as
              possible on the first version of a code, because you're going to throw
              it away and write it over. That seems unintuitive, but it's good
              practice. Without putting in the heavy lifting on the first version, the
              important lessons don't get learned.</p>
              
              <p>That solo game of StarSoldier (above) occupied probably 8 hours of time
              spread over 3 sessions while laid out on the table for two weeks. It
              went 2 full turns, with Turn 3 being basically a no-op with the losing
              force exiting the board. This is that "version 1," a throwaway game
              filled with BS&amp;T, which will make all succeeding games that much the
              easier.</p>
              
              <p>Just as I take notes at work when developing software, I take <em>copious</em>
              notes while playing initial games to learn rules. At work, the notes go
              into a paper notebook which legally belongs to my employer. For games, I
              usually end up publishing notes on Github, more or less in blog form. I
              find that writing every move out helps me learn. And when I'm playing
              out of the house, I can sneak a look at my notes using my iphone. Handy!</p>
              
              <p>One nice side effect of sweating the rules solo is that I rarely suffer
              from AP when playing an opponent. I've already done the analysis, so
              there is no paralysis.</p>
              
              <p>YMMV of course, but try writing out at least a couple of turns in
              excruciating detail. Maybe not every turn, maybe not the first turn, but
              at least for a of couple of the early turns, write it all out. It's a
              lot of work, but I find it really helpful and so might you.</p>
              
              <h2 id="self-teaching-strategy">Self-teaching strategy</h2>
              
              <p>I find I'm unable to really dig into a new game solitaire if I don't
              take copious notes on game play. But not just a lot of notes, the notes
              have to be structured appropriately. My most efficient way of
              structuring for learning is to write out the turn sequence in detail,
              then follow the turn sequence through every move of the game. This is
              time consuming, probably more time consuming than just setting up and
              running with it. However, I've found I won't take the time to play at
              all unless I'm following the script laid out in the turn sequence.</p>
              
              <p>A case in point: I've had Tonkin set up for a month, and have been stuck
              on the first turn in the first movement phase for the first player. I do
              have the turn sequence written out and I'm following it, but I don't
              quite get how the counters are laid out, nor how movement is handled via
              ZOCs and terrain. I'll have to write out a complete movement sequence
              for several units so that I'll understand what to do for any arbitrary
              unit. That will increase playing time, but it will cycle the game across
              my table faster with respect the wall clock, and will help me bust
              through the sticking point.</p>
              
              <p>The lesson here is trying to take short cuts just doesn't work for me
              for learning new games.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
