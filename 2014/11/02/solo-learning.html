                Solo learning
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov  2 2014</time>
              <p>Since you askedâ€¦</p>
              
              <p>I just don't worry about it, not even a little bit.</p>
              
              <p>This may be a result of programming web applications for a living, where
              almost every day finds an opportunity to practice humility. Also known
              as having one's face shoved into a steaming pile of ignorance.</p>
              
              <p>As a result, I don't expect to get the rules right. In fact, I expect to
              get them wrong, if not laughably wrong.</p>
              
              <p>For example, I just wrapped up my first game of StarSoldier (solo), a
              vintage game from the Redmond Simonsen stable, for which scenarios
              should be fairly well-balanced. I managed to score 70 to 20, where a
              decisive win is 26+. Obviously, I did something really, really wrong.
              Most likely, several things, as I can think of a couple right off the
              top of my head.</p>
              
              <p>This is fine, not a problem at all.</p>
              
              <p>There is this notion in software that one should work as hard as
              possible on the first version of a code, because you're going to throw
              it away and write it over. That seems unintuitive, but it's good
              practice. Without putting in the heavy lifting on the first version, the
              important lessons don't get learned.</p>
              
              <p>That solo game of StarForce (above) occupied probably 8 hours of time
              spread over 3 sessions while laid out on the table for two weeks. It
              went 2 full turns, with Turn 3 being basically a no-op with the losing
              force exiting the board. This is that "version 1," a throwaway game
              filled with BS&amp;T, which will make all succeeding games that much the
              easier.</p>
              
              <p>Just as I take notes at work when developing software, I take <em>copious</em>
              notes while playing initial games to learn rules. At work, the notes go
              into a paper notebook which legally belongs to my employer. For games, I
              usually end up publishing notes on Github, more or less in blog form. I
              find that writing every move out helps me learn. And when I'm playing
              out of the house, I can sneak a look at my notes using my iphone. Handy!</p>
              
              <p>One nice side effect of sweating the rules solo is that I rarely suffer
              from AP when playing an opponent. I've already done the analysis, so
              there is no paralysis.</p>
              
              <p>YMMV of course, but try writing out at least a couple of turns in
              excruciating detail. Maybe not every turn, maybe not the first turn, but
              at least for a of couple of the early turns, write it all out. It's a
              lot of work, but I find it really helpful and so might you.</p>

                  any plays at all, and Situation 7 only a single solo play. Situations 10

                  Arab Israeli Wars is coming!

                <li>
                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
