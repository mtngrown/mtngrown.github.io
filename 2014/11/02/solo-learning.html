<p>Since you askedâ€¦</p>

<p>I just don't worry about it, not even a little bit.</p>

<p>This may be a result of programming web applications for a living, where
almost every day finds an opportunity to practice humility. Also known
as having one's face shoved into a steaming pile of ignorance.</p>

<p>As a result, I don't expect to get the rules right. In fact, I expect to
get them wrong, if not laughably wrong.</p>

<p>For example, I just wrapped up my first game of StarSoldier (solo), a
vintage game from the Redmond Simonsen stable, for which scenarios
should be fairly well-balanced. I managed to score 70 to 20, where a
decisive win is 26+. Obviously, I did something really, really wrong.
Most likely, several things, as I can think of a couple right off the
top of my head.</p>

<p>This is fine, not a problem at all.</p>

<p>There is this notion in software that one should work as hard as
possible on the first version of a code, because you're going to throw
it away and write it over. That seems unintuitive, but it's good
practice. Without putting in the heavy lifting on the first version, the
important lessons don't get learned.</p>

<p>That solo game of StarSoldier (above) occupied probably 8 hours of time
spread over 3 sessions while laid out on the table for two weeks. It
went 2 full turns, with Turn 3 being basically a no-op with the losing
force exiting the board. This is that "version 1," a throwaway game
filled with BS&amp;T, which will make all succeeding games that much the
easier.</p>

<p>Just as I take notes at work when developing software, I take <em>copious</em>
notes while playing initial games to learn rules. At work, the notes go
into a paper notebook which legally belongs to my employer. For games, I
usually end up publishing notes on Github, more or less in blog form. I
find that writing every move out helps me learn. And when I'm playing
out of the house, I can sneak a look at my notes using my iphone. Handy!</p>

<p>One nice side effect of sweating the rules solo is that I rarely suffer
from AP when playing an opponent. I've already done the analysis, so
there is no paralysis.</p>

<p>YMMV of course, but try writing out at least a couple of turns in
excruciating detail. Maybe not every turn, maybe not the first turn, but
at least for a of couple of the early turns, write it all out. It's a
lot of work, but I find it really helpful and so might you.</p>

<h2 id="self-teaching-strategy">Self-teaching strategy</h2>

<p>I find I'm unable to really dig into a new game solitaire if I don't
take copious notes on game play. But not just a lot of notes, the notes
have to be structured appropriately. My most efficient way of
structuring for learning is to write out the turn sequence in detail,
then follow the turn sequence through every move of the game. This is
time consuming, probably more time consuming than just setting up and
running with it. However, I've found I won't take the time to play at
all unless I'm following the script laid out in the turn sequence.</p>

<p>A case in point: I've had Tonkin set up for a month, and have been stuck
on the first turn in the first movement phase for the first player. I do
have the turn sequence written out and I'm following it, but I don't
quite get how the counters are laid out, nor how movement is handled via
ZOCs and terrain. I'll have to write out a complete movement sequence
for several units so that I'll understand what to do for any arbitrary
unit. That will increase playing time, but it will cycle the game across
my table faster with respect the wall clock, and will help me bust
through the sticking point.</p>

<p>The lesson here is trying to take short cuts just doesn't work for me
for learning new games.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
