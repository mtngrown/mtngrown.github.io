Flash Point redux
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov  3 2014</time>
<p>Played another beginner setup of Flash Point this evening. Here's how it
went:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Played with two firefighters instead of 1.</li>
  <li>Figured out carrying a victim costs 2 AP instead of 1 AP. This slows
it down a lot!</li>
  <li>Not so lucky rolls this time. One of the firefighters was Knocked
Down, although it was lucky he was right by a door next to the Ambulance
area, so no big deal.</li>
  <li>Rescued 5 victims, lost two, one of which was a False Alarm.</li>
  <li>A couple of unlucky Explosions ate up damage markers, so I lost by
Building Collapse.</li>
</ul>

<p>This game, even though I lost, felt a bit more satisfying than the
previous, which I probably won because of not paying two AP for carrying
victims.</p>

<p>I'll probably play more of these kinds of games in the evenings. There
is a good cost benefit ratio here, better than reading expensive books.
I'd prefer to wargame in general, but that's proven a bit too heavy for
evening entertainment to date. We'll see what happens in the future.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
