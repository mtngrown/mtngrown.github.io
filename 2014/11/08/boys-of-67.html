Boys of '67
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov  8 2014</time>
<p>Al S and I are going to play through the Snoopy's Nose scenario in the
Vietnam Battles issue of Modern War. This game uses the "Fire and
Movement" system common to several other games in the Decision Games
portfolio.</p>

<p>Before then, I'd like to get a grip on how fire and movement actually
work in this game, hence, setting up the learning scenario "Boys of '67"
for a fast solitaire play through.</p>

<h2 id="setting-it-up">Setting it up</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/snoopys/boys67/boys_of_67_setup.jpg" alt="Boys of '67 set up" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>US moves to surround VC and attack:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/snoopys/boys67/turn_1_us_attacks.jpg" alt="Combat Turn 1 US attacks" /></p>

<p>Combat, US attacks 514/1:</p>

<p>US total: 16
VC total: 10</p>

<p>Delta +6, roll 4, no effect. (This was a blunder, I read from the +5
column. The result should have been an exchange.)</p>

<p>The VC moves to escape:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/snoopys/boys67/turn_1_vc_move.jpg" alt="VC move" /></p>

<p>Fire support for VC attack shown above.</p>

<p>The VC have 3 options for attacking here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Both 514/1 and 514/2 attack Cav 5/3, with best delta of +2 after fire
support factored in and countered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either 514/1 or 514/2 attack Cav 5/3, best delta in this case is -1,
which is almost certain elimination as there is no EZOC-free retreat
for VC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do nothing, which reduces risk of an attacker loss, but loses
opportunity to inflict at least some damage.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>VC choose Option 1.</p>

<p>Delta +2, roll 2, Ex(change), step loss for 514/2 and Cav 5/3.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>The idea here is to not let the 514/1 get away while finishing off the
512/2. Cav 5/3 is out of the action for the moment.</p>

<p>Bombardment won't have any effect by itself due to counterbattery
augmenting the 514/2's defense strength.</p>

<p>This leaves 4/47 B and C companies to attack.</p>

<p>The delta is +5, roll 4, no effect, same as last.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/snoopys/boys67/us_turn_2.jpg" alt="VC move" /></p>

<p>Note: The monitor, for reasons unknown, did not fire, otherwise this
would have been an Exchange result in the +6 column. It pays to pay
attention.</p>

<p>The VC decide to keep running. No profit in this fight.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/snoopys/boys67/vc_turn_2.jpg" alt="VC move" /></p>

<p>We're half done.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>The "game" is half over, and there are still VC on the map. The US needs
to get busy.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/snoopys/boys67/us_turn_3.jpg" alt="VC move" /></p>

<p>Combat:</p>

<p>US needs +8 minimum for best results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monitor: 1</li>
  <li>3/47 A: 2</li>
  <li>3/47 B: 2</li>
  <li>4/47 B: 3</li>
  <li>4/47 C: 3</li>
  <li>FS: 12</li>
  <li>Total: 23</li>
</ul>

<p>VC defends with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>514/2: 4</li>
  <li>FS: 11</li>
  <li>Total: 15</li>
</ul>

<p>Delta: +8, roll 2, D2, 514/2 eliminated, no retreat through EZOC.</p>

<p>514/1 continues moving east.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>US nearly surrounds 514/1.</p>

<p>Bombard to use up counterbattery, has no other effect. US fields 5 + 5
bombardment, 514/1 counters with 5 + 2. This removes the +5
counterbattery from the VC arsenal for this turn, providing 1 less delta
for defensive fire support.</p>

<p>Here's the situation with bombardment counters shown, and the VC in
position after Turn 3:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/snoopys/boys67/us_turn_4.jpg" alt="VC move" /></p>

<p>Combat:</p>

<p>US attacks with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monitor: 1</li>
  <li>3/47 A: 2</li>
  <li>3/47 B: 2</li>
  <li>3/47 C: 2</li>
  <li>4/47 B: 3</li>
  <li>4/47 C: 3</li>
  <li>FS: 12</li>
  <li>Total: 25</li>
</ul>

<p>VC defends with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>514/1: 5</li>
  <li>FS: 10</li>
  <li>Total: 14</li>
</ul>

<p>Delta: +11 for US.</p>

<p>The odds are 50% retreat with D2 or D3 which would be a US win, or an
Ex(change), which would result in a draw.</p>

<p>Roll 5, Exchange, VC moves to 0820, and it's draw.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Ok, that was interesting. Definitely a bit different from other combat
resolutions I've played. The results most closely resemble the low
combat factors and hard-to-kill results from Central America.</p>

<p>Not clear on the Bombardment system. Feels a bit contrived. But I don't
really care overmuch as long as the scenarios are mostly balanced in the
end.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
