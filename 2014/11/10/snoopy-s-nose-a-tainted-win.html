<p>Played the 13 turn Snoopy's Nose scenario with AS today. Was a very
fun game, and came down to the last turn, superior firepower carried
the day.</p>

<p>The premise of the game is for US and ARVN forces to conduct what would
be an Assault Operation in Fire in the Lake. With respect to that game,
a Sweep Operation has located VC within a small part of the Mekong
Delta, and forces are transported in by boats (Tangos) and helicopters
(Slicks).</p>

<p>The exact position of VC forces is not known, however, which is modeled
in the game by secret deployment. The VC player writes out the location
of all the forces and VC bases, showing just a handful on the map.</p>

<p>The US/ARVN player then needs to locate these forces by moving through
the Area of Operation, where moving through hexes adjacent to VC exposes
the VC position.</p>

<h2 id="turns-5-13">Turns 5-13</h2>

<p>At this point, we got very involved in the game and didn't feel like
taking the time to record the play turn by turn.</p>

<h2 id="after-action-report">After Action Report</h2>

<p>This game felt like a VC win until about Turn 10, then the tide turned.</p>

<p>The key to the game is exposing the VC fast, by Turn 8 or 9, all the
bases need to be exposed or the US is going to have a really hard time
of it.</p>

<p>Overall, there is not a lot of replay in the game straight of the "box,"
The main stumbling block is that there aren't that many places to hide
VC base camps which can't be exposed via road or river, and those few
places can be exposed via helicoptered troops pretty fast.</p>

<p>But there seems like potential for plays with the map, system and
counters. There just has to be more which can be done with this.</p>

<p>This would be a fantastic game to loan to - and referee for - two players
who haven't ever played it before.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<p>I'm pretty sure I moved the mech units too fast across rivers on the
last two turns. I think it costs them all MP to get across without
having engineer close by for building bridge. I was charging an extra MP
similar to the leg units.</p>

<p>If this is the case, our game was very, very close.  Restricting mech
movement more would have made the final two turns way closer on the
rolls.  Pretty sure I played the mech more or less correctly up until
then though, as the mech stayed mainly on roads and in clear.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we forgot about the fire support penalty against VC
losing bases: each base costs an extra fire support marker.</p>

<p>Here's a convenient list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile units cost all MP crossing river without bridge.</li>
  <li>VC fire support is reduced as each base is taken by US.</li>
  <li>Tangos, the riverine transports, do not expose VC (but monitors do).</li>
  <li>River landing on a concealed VC-occupied hex induces an ambush.</li>
  <li>Fire supporting a riverine landing is limited to one marker the turn
of the landing.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the game we played, it felt the like the last couple of turns were
almost a walk-over, despite the last two die rolls which could have lost
it for the US had the combat differential been lower by a single point.
Eliminating the blunders listed above would go a long way to tilting the
game back in the VC's favor.</p>

<h3 id="development-opportunity">Development opportunity</h3>

<p>The game is pretty good as-is, although as usual for magazine games,
there are no player aids. A couple could be helpful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Letter-sized full color laminated map for both players. The VC can
mark their units, the US can mark the areas which have been swept.
This would be so phenomenally useful for the US player that it might
unbalance the game with respect to 13 turns.</li>
  <li>CRT as its own sheet, mitigates passing the rules back and forth.
Of course the rules can be copied allowing each player their own set,
definitely not a problem with 16 page rule book.</li>
</ul>

<p>Increasingly replayability:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow for mixed results or a draw. For example, if the US eliminates
all bases and all units by Turn 12, decisive victory. All bases or all
units by Turn 12, tactical victory, All bases or all units by Turn 13,
marginal victory. For the VC, losing all bases should be a loss, but not
losing all units should allow for a draw in some condition.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
