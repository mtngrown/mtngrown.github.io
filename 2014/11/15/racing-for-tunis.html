                Racing for Tunis
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 15 2014</time>
              <p>Playing Germans against CC Allies.</p>
              
              <p>I established a pretty good line early on, then took a bit of a risk by
              briefly taking Le Ket. Unfortunately, this thinned out my line a liitle
              too much and Allies took a couple of my units off the board. A fast
              regroup wasn't enough to firm up the line, had to start retreating by
              Nov 30.</p>
              
              <p>Dec. 2 Germans could be in a lot of trouble really soon. The line
              forward of Bizerta needs to be pulled back.</p>
              
              <p>Dec. 6, Germans breaking out to retake lost ground. Operationally, some
              of the Allied units are enveloped to the east.</p>
              
              <p>Dec. 8, some break out by the Germans to recapture lost ground, but
              conceded as a decisive Allied Victory. The Germans just gave up too much
              ground early on attempt to maintain a defense of Tunis, and the Aliies had
              to catch a train back to Berkeley.</p>
              
              <p>Here's what it looks like set up:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Race for Tunis set up" src="/images/race_for_tunis_setup.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>A few units may be a hex out of place as I had bumped the table
              attempting the first picture. But the overall deployment shows the
              general idea: the Germans in a defensive line around Tunis and Bizerta
              to control the ports and airfields.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-length-and-timing">Turn length and timing</h2>
              
              <p>The standard game has 18 turns. Given 10 minutes per side, that's a game
              length of 6 hours.  However, as noted above, the game ended at roughly
              15 turns as some of our middle turns went longer than shorter.</p>
              
              <p>We went closer to 7.5 hours, having started around 3 pm, ending around
              11:30, with an hour off for dinner.  It felt like a lot longer. Two
              immediate reasons for this are 1. 11:30 pm is later than I usually like
              to stay up, and 7.5 hours is longer than I usually play. Writing this
              the following morning, I recall having to suck it up during the last few
              turns.</p>
              
              <h2 id="how-to-win-as-germans">How to win as Germans</h2>
              
              <p>In short, I don't know. I'm pretty sure the Germans have to be played a
              lot more agressively than I was playing them though. We didn't play with
              the optional supply rules, and I think that would have made a difference
              in both side's play. Certainly the Germans would have attempted to cut
              off extreme eastern Allied advancement.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
