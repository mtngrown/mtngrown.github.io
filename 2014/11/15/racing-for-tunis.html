Racing for Tunis
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 15 2014</time>
<p>Playing Germans against CC Allies.</p>

<p>I established a pretty good line early on, then took a bit of a risk by
briefly taking Le Ket. Unfortunately, this thinned out my line a liitle
too much and Allies took a couple of my units off the board. A fast
regroup wasn't enough to firm up the line, had to start retreating by
Nov 30.</p>

<p>Dec. 2 Germans could be in a lot of trouble really soon. The line
forward of Bizerta needs to be pulled back.</p>

<p>Dec. 6, Germans breaking out to retake lost ground. Operationally, some
of the Allied units are enveloped to the east.</p>

<p>Dec. 8, some break out by the Germans to recapture lost ground, but
conceded as a decisive Allied Victory. The Germans just gave up too much
ground early on attempt to maintain a defense of Tunis, and the Aliies had
to catch a train back to Berkeley.</p>

<p>Here's what it looks like set up:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/race_for_tunis_setup.jpg" alt="Race for Tunis set up" /></p>

<p>A few units may be a hex out of place as I had bumped the table
attempting the first picture. But the overall deployment shows the
general idea: the Germans in a defensive line around Tunis and Bizerta
to control the ports and airfields.</p>

<h2 id="turn-length-and-timing">Turn length and timing</h2>

<p>The standard game has 18 turns. Given 10 minutes per side, that's a game
length of 6 hours.  However, as noted above, the game ended at roughly
15 turns as some of our middle turns went longer than shorter.</p>

<p>We went closer to 7.5 hours, having started around 3 pm, ending around
11:30, with an hour off for dinner.  It felt like a lot longer. Two
immediate reasons for this are 1. 11:30 pm is later than I usually like
to stay up, and 7.5 hours is longer than I usually play. Writing this
the following morning, I recall having to suck it up during the last few
turns.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-win-as-germans">How to win as Germans</h2>

<p>In short, I don't know. I'm pretty sure the Germans have to be played a
lot more agressively than I was playing them though. We didn't play with
the optional supply rules, and I think that would have made a difference
in both side's play. Certainly the Germans would have attempted to cut
off extreme eastern Allied advancement.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
