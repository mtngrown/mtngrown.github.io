                Race for Tunis redux

              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 26 2014</time>
              <p>Another play of Race for Tunis with CC. We switched side from the last
              game: I played Allied forces here and CC the Axis.</p>
              
              <p>We decided to play the standard scenario with all the optional rules.</p>
              
              <p>Here is the game recapped turn by turn.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: destroys bridge south of Bizerta, moves forces out of Bizerta
              and Tunis, aggressively establishing an offensive line push south and
              west.</li>
                <li>Allies: Shoring up line as best as possible to prevent large Axis push
              to the west.</li>
              </ul>

                <li>Allies: Holding.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: big reinforcement arrival, destroy bridge east of Mateur.
              Continuing to put pressure southeast.</li>
                <li>Allies: Still holding, looks like will need to start yeilding ground
              soon.</li>

                <li>Axis: Still moving south, targeting French for elimination.</li>
                <li>Allies: Working hard to hold the line, French are getting sacrificed,
              which is bad, as they cannot come in as replacements.</li>

              unable to move into city. Holding elsewhere. Air on dirt strips
              grounded.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: Chasing the para and commando units, holding elsewhere. Really
              bad luck see 2 Para destroying an attacking force.</li>
                <li>Allies: Reinforcements coming in north and south, driving east at high speed.
              overextending in an attempt to cut supply.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: Feeling some pressure, what with Allied special forces units
              running around in the hinterland. They may be out of supply, but they're
              still dangerous.</li>
                <li>Allies: Paras drop onto Djebaba, lost commando unit at El Anuiona. No
              big deal, will bring this back in as a replacement.</li>

              recapture airfield at Djebaba.</li>

              west of due south from Bizerta. Eliminated a powerfull allied mech
              unit with application of a lot of air power.</li>
                <li>Allied: Yeilding the line, buying time for reinforcements to come in
              and shore it up.</li>

              also took airfield at Bizerta in combat. Had positioned supporting
              artillery in earlier turns. Waited for clear weather to apply all
              air assets to combat for airfield.</li>

                <li>Allied: consolidate at Bizerta, attack south of Robaa successfully
              driving Germans out of supply in that area.</li>

              fails.</li>
                <li>Allies: Counterattacking at Bizerta employing all available air power
              with clear weather, eliminate huge stack of Axis armor, bad blow for
              Axis.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: Eliminated some para and commando units, but left Tunis open
              again, whenceâ€¦</li>
                <li>Allies: Replacement commandos land at Tunis, again, taking the city,
              which is promptly reinforces with units from Bizerta, with a combined
              defensive value of 8-10 (iirc), which is doubled for city defense.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h2 id="dec-9-1942">Dec. 9, 1942</h2>
              
              <p>Axis concedes, having lost too many units to slow down a certain mauling
              from Allied forces during the next two days. Plus, 10 pm.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>Excellent game overall. CC played the Germans <em>brilliantly</em> through the
              first half of the game, forcing the Allies back even as they were
              reinforced, and holding a very string defensive line stretching due
              south and a little west of Bizerta. However, this line was established
              at the expense of leaving Bizerta and Tunis open, and leaving other
              airfields undefended. When the Allies started exercising commando and
              para drops, it changed the nature of the game considerably.</p>
              
              <p>However, even with the Allied forces operating behind the lines, had the
              Axis provided even nominal garrison forces at Bizerta and Tunis, it is
              highly unlikely the Allies would have been able to take them.</p>
              
              <p>Overall, an excellent game, very tense with a lot grappling over terrain
              and a major seesaw in the action.</p>
              
              <p>We're playing Bloody Kasserine next.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>

                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
