                Race for Tunis redux

              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 26 2014</time>
              <p>Another play of Race for Tunis with CC. We switched side from the last
              game: I played Allied forces here and CC the Axis.</p>
              
              <p>We decided to play the standard scenario with all the optional rules.</p>
              
              <p>Here is the game recapped turn by turn.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: destroys bridge south of Bizerta, moves forces out of Bizerta
              and Tunis, aggressively establishing an offensive line push south and
              west.</li>
                <li>Allies: Shoring up line as best as possible to prevent large Axis push
              to the west.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: Pushing hard to the southwest; eliminated French unit.</li>
                <li>Allies: Holding.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: big reinforcement arrival, destroy bridge east of Mateur.
              Continuing to put pressure southeast.</li>
                <li>Allies: Still holding, looks like will need to start yeilding ground
              soon.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: Still moving south, targeting French for elimination.</li>
                <li>Allies: Working hard to hold the line, French are getting sacrificed,
              which is bad, as they cannot come in as replacements.</li>
              </ul>

                <li>Axis: Pushing hard to the west, targeting weak French units.</li>
                <li>Allies: Paras drop east of Tunis to attempt to capture Tunis, but
              unable to move into city. Holding elsewhere. Air on dirt strips
              grounded.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: Some inclusive jockeying about; retreated the Allied paras.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: Chasing the para and commando units, holding elsewhere. Really
              bad luck see 2 Para destroying an attacking force.</li>
                <li>Allies: Reinforcements coming in north and south, driving east at high speed.
              overextending in an attempt to cut supply.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: Feeling some pressure, what with Allied special forces units
              running around in the hinterland. They may be out of supply, but they're
              still dangerous.</li>
                <li>Allies: Paras drop onto Djebaba, lost commando unit at El Anuiona. No
              big deal, will bring this back in as a replacement.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: Crappy reinforcement. Destroyed more bridges, attempted to
              recapture airfield at Djebaba.</li>
                <li>Allies: Chewing away at Axis engineer units.</li>

                <li>Axis: Stalling for time now, trying to hold a line almost a little
              west of due south from Bizerta. Eliminated a powerfull allied mech
              unit with application of a lot of air power.</li>
                <li>Allied: Yeilding the line, buying time for reinforcements to come in
              and shore it up.</li>

                <li>Allies: Took Bizerta and Tunis with daring commando and para raid,
              also took airfield at Bizerta in combat. Had positioned supporting
              artillery in earlier turns. Waited for clear weather to apply all
              air assets to combat for airfield.</li>

                <li>Allied: consolidate at Bizerta, attack south of Robaa successfully
              driving Germans out of supply in that area.</li>

              fails.</li>
                <li>Allies: Counterattacking at Bizerta employing all available air power
              with clear weather, eliminate huge stack of Axis armor, bad blow for
              Axis.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>Axis: Eliminated some para and commando units, but left Tunis open
              again, whenceâ€¦</li>
                <li>Allies: Replacement commandos land at Tunis, again, taking the city,
              which is promptly reinforces with units from Bizerta, with a combined
              defensive value of 8-10 (iirc), which is doubled for city defense.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h2 id="dec-9-1942">Dec. 9, 1942</h2>
              
              <p>Axis concedes, having lost too many units to slow down a certain mauling
              from Allied forces during the next two days. Plus, 10 pm.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>Excellent game overall. CC played the Germans <em>brilliantly</em> through the
              first half of the game, forcing the Allies back even as they were
              reinforced, and holding a very string defensive line stretching due
              south and a little west of Bizerta. However, this line was established
              at the expense of leaving Bizerta and Tunis open, and leaving other
              airfields undefended. When the Allies started exercising commando and
              para drops, it changed the nature of the game considerably.</p>
              
              <p>However, even with the Allied forces operating behind the lines, had the
              Axis provided even nominal garrison forces at Bizerta and Tunis, it is
              highly unlikely the Allies would have been able to take them.</p>
              
              <p>Overall, an excellent game, very tense with a lot grappling over terrain
              and a major seesaw in the action.</p>
              
              <p>We're playing Bloody Kasserine next.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking

                  this game is still in shrink.
