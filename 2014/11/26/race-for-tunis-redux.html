<p>Another play of Race for Tunis with CC. We switched side from the last
game: I played Allied forces here and CC the Axis.</p>

<p>We decided to play the standard scenario with all the optional rules.</p>

<p>Here is the game recapped turn by turn.</p>

<h2 id="nov-25-1942">Nov. 25, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: destroys bridge south of Bizerta, moves forces out of Bizerta
and Tunis, aggressively establishing an offensive line push south and
west.</li>
  <li>Allies: Shoring up line as best as possible to prevent large Axis push
to the west.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nov-26-1942">Nov. 26, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Pushing hard to the southwest; eliminated French unit.</li>
  <li>Allies: Holding.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nov-27-1942">Nov. 27, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: big reinforcement arrival, destroy bridge east of Mateur.
Continuing to put pressure southeast.</li>
  <li>Allies: Still holding, looks like will need to start yeilding ground
soon.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nov-28-1942">Nov. 28, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Still moving south, targeting French for elimination.</li>
  <li>Allies: Working hard to hold the line, French are getting sacrificed,
which is bad, as they cannot come in as replacements.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nov-29-1942">Nov. 29, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: Rain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Pushing hard to the west, targeting weak French units.</li>
  <li>Allies: Paras drop east of Tunis to attempt to capture Tunis, but
unable to move into city. Holding elsewhere. Air on dirt strips
grounded.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nov-30-1942">Nov. 30, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: Clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Some inclusive jockeying about; retreated the Allied paras.</li>
  <li>Allies: Falling back slowly to the west, trying to bait the Axis into</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dec-1-1942">Dec. 1, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: Rain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Chasing the para and commando units, holding elsewhere. Really
bad luck see 2 Para destroying an attacking force.</li>
  <li>Allies: Reinforcements coming in north and south, driving east at high speed.
overextending in an attempt to cut supply.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dec-2-1942">Dec. 2, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: clear</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Feeling some pressure, what with Allied special forces units
running around in the hinterland. They may be out of supply, but they're
still dangerous.</li>
  <li>Allies: Paras drop onto Djebaba, lost commando unit at El Anuiona. No
big deal, will bring this back in as a replacement.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dec-3-1942">Dec. 3, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: Rain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Crappy reinforcement. Destroyed more bridges, attempted to
recapture airfield at Djebaba.</li>
  <li>Allies: Chewing away at Axis engineer units.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dec-4-1942">Dec. 4, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Stalling for time now, trying to hold a line almost a little
west of due south from Bizerta. Eliminated a powerfull allied mech
unit with application of a lot of air power.</li>
  <li>Allied: Yeilding the line, buying time for reinforcements to come in
and shore it up.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dec-5-1942">Dec. 5, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: Clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Holding, no combat.</li>
  <li>Allies: Took Bizerta and Tunis with daring commando and para raid,
also took airfield at Bizerta in combat. Had positioned supporting
artillery in earlier turns. Waited for clear weather to apply all
air assets to combat for airfield.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dec-6-1942">Dec. 6, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: Rain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Retook Tunis, could not retake Bizerta.</li>
  <li>Allied: consolidate at Bizerta, attack south of Robaa successfully
driving Germans out of supply in that area.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dec-7-1942">Dec. 7, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: Clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Attempt to take Bizerta at low odds with huge stack of armor
fails.</li>
  <li>Allies: Counterattacking at Bizerta employing all available air power
with clear weather, eliminate huge stack of Axis armor, bad blow for
Axis.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dec-8-1942">Dec. 8, 1942</h2>

<p>Weather: Rain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Axis: Eliminated some para and commando units, but left Tunis open
again, whenceâ€¦</li>
  <li>Allies: Replacement commandos land at Tunis, again, taking the city,
which is promptly reinforces with units from Bizerta, with a combined
defensive value of 8-10 (iirc), which is doubled for city defense.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dec-9-1942">Dec. 9, 1942</h2>

<p>Axis concedes, having lost too many units to slow down a certain mauling
from Allied forces during the next two days. Plus, 10 pm.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Excellent game overall. CC played the Germans <em>brilliantly</em> through the
first half of the game, forcing the Allies back even as they were
reinforced, and holding a very string defensive line stretching due
south and a little west of Bizerta. However, this line was established
at the expense of leaving Bizerta and Tunis open, and leaving other
airfields undefended. When the Allies started exercising commando and
para drops, it changed the nature of the game considerably.</p>

<p>However, even with the Allied forces operating behind the lines, had the
Axis provided even nominal garrison forces at Bizerta and Tunis, it is
highly unlikely the Allies would have been able to take them.</p>

<p>Overall, an excellent game, very tense with a lot grappling over terrain
and a major seesaw in the action.</p>

<p>We're playing Bloody Kasserine next.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
