Wood gas, charcoal trucks and North Africa
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec  2 2014</time>
<p>I'm setting up Scenario 1, the "Race for Tunis" in the OCS <em>Tunisia</em>
game. There is a lot of vocabulary I to learn, some of which seems to be
assumed known to the player. For example, the setup OOB calls for
"charcoal trucks," which I've never heard of. Cursory examination of
relevant forums didn't turn up much information. So I had to go to
Google, where I found the following links.</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the
<a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Da4hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rpoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3499%2C2992632)">Reading Eagle</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll46/id/529">Shanghai Times</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=X1EEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=tunisia+charcoal+truck+points&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_Z1Jh6LuAD&amp;sig=U9xmhcnPjQEXl7RoBcirsjfgQgg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jyp-VKTOCq_0iAL9t4HwBQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Life Magazine, March 8, 1943</a>
has a very interesting human interest article by Corporal Robert
Hopkins, who turns out to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hopkins">Harry
Hopkins</a> son.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that's pretty cool.</p>

<p>We're not going to ever run out fuel, not really. We might get low for a
few decades before finding a sustainable steady state, but the fuel is
there. It grows by itself, for free.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-tunisia">Setting up Tunisia</h2>

<p>Setting up an OCS game which models an actual, historical battle is a
non-trivial exercise. Tunisia has the advantage of of having few units
on the map at the beginning of the game. However, this is offset by
having often substantial reinforcements arriving nearly every single
turn. For game play reasons, these reinforcements should be organized in
advance. Unfortunately, I don't have the table space to organize that.
The space I have is roughly 2'x3' total, the size of a standard map.</p>

<p>The set up is interesting though. I recognize the general situation from
playing <a href="/tags/race-for-tunis.html">Chadwick's Race for Tunis</a> a couple of times.
For some reason, the map and counters are difficult to read on both
Chadwick's game and this OCS game, so they share that as well.</p>

<p>As it turns out, I didn't have enough time to devote learning the OCS
system to play 14 turns of this scenario, so I ended up tearind it down.
I'm still interested in it, but I want to get more comfortable with the
OCS system first.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
