Battling for Hue
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 25 2014</time>
<p>Back to Vietnam with a <em>very</em> early (1973) game entitled "Battle for
Hue," designed by John Hill of later Squad Leader fame.</p>

<p>Battle for Hue is not a "pretty" game, not at all. The map and counters
are workaday servicable, there is no eye candy here. That said, the type
on the 1/2" counters is large and easy to read, even in lower light.</p>

<p>More features of the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rules are one sheet of folded tabloid.</li>
  <li>There are no hex numbers on the map.</li>
  <li>CRT is bloody: there is no defense, simply firepower.</li>
  <li>The counters have firepower and range values, there is no defense
factor on any counter. There is no dispersion, step loss or
disorganization. A unit either survives an attack or it does not.</li>
  <li>Fire is "simultaneous." Units being fired on can (usually) return
fire. No units are removed until they can return fire.</li>
  <li>The game could run more than 36 turns, as the game ending condition is
"no more NVA/VC in the inner city." I may not play <em>this</em> game quite
that long.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lacking any idea of what I need to do, here's my initial set up for a
solo game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-hue/hue_g1_setup.jpg" alt="Battle for Hue initial setup" /></p>

<p>In the north, NVA focus is on capturing the armory as fast as possible to
get counter upgrades, including extra VC rolls. In the south, NVA will
attempt to roadblock and ZOC US entry from Phu Bai. Note that all the
NVA in the inner city start in built up areas, and have no stacking
capability.</p>

<p>Let's see what happens.</p>

<h2 id="january-31-1968-opening-moves">January 31, 1968: opening moves</h2>

<p><strong>NVA Move</strong> NVA moves up to ARVN armory, ARVN "first fire" fails with a d6 roll 6.
Rolling a 6 in this game is pretty much bad news at any odds, what with
the DRMs.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> NVA targets the ARVN armory. The choice is whether
to play it safe and wear down the bunkered and barbed wire defense (+4
DRM) over a couple of turns, or take the riskier option of trying to
eliminate more units with lesser firepower per unit. Since the NVA can
use rockets this turn, the safer alternative looks better: take out the
higher firepower ARVN defenders first. First roll is a 3 at
11<sup id="fnref:artillery-halved"><a href="#fn:artillery-halved" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, defender
eliminated. Second roll is a 2 at 11, also defender eliminated.  Follow
on attacks by W 3-6 units eliminate on a roll of 1: roll, 1, 3! Bunker
next to ARVN armory is clear, 1 unit in armory remains.</p>

<p>ARVN fires: roll 3 defender in clear, eliminated, roll 6 miss.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road Movement</strong> Police units move to flank NVA infantry unit.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road Movement</strong> close with NVA, first fire: NVA rolls 5
on firepower 2, miss.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong>: ARVN rolls 5, miss, NVA rolls 2, miss with +2
DRM in city hex.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-hue/hue_g1_jan31.jpg" alt="Battle for Hue January 31, 1968" /></p>

<p>NVA get 1 VP for each of the 3 ARVN eliminated and 1 VP for one turn in
inner city.</p>

<h4 id="score">Score</h4>

<ul>
  <li>NVA 4.</li>
  <li>ARVN/US 1.</li>

<p>And that's it for Turn 1, January 31, 1968.</p>

<h2 id="february-1-1968-vc-eruption">February 1, 1968: VC eruption</h2>

<p>The VC enter the game this turn, determined by rolling 2 d6: 9!
What a great roll for the commies. The few reviews for this game
emphasize the hopelessness of the NVA/VC situation, but it's looking
about as good as it could at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>NVA Move</strong> small repositioning to get better odds on armory and police
units.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> ARVN armory: roll 4, armory will belong to NVA next
movement turn. 2 more ARVN police units elminated by artillery fire.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road</strong> no movement.</p>

<p>(<em>Note: I forgot to bring in ARVN/US reinforcements on this phase. This
didn't matter for the US forces as the Phu Bai road was blocked by NVA.
It does make a difference for the ARVN forces as they come in on the
west edge and will certainly attempt to eliminate the NVA artillery as
soon as possible. The three ARVN units will come on February 2 with the
usual reinforcements.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road</strong> engage NVA/VC in southeast inner city, first fire
misses.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> 1 VC and 1 Police unit eliminated.</p>

<p><strong>NVA/VC Move</strong> Time to blow at least some bridges, and hope not to
get caught out.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> 2 more ARVN bite it. NVA artillery is very
effective. Marines come out to play, firing on VC blocking far egress on
eastern Perfume River bridge. FP 6, +2 DRM, roll 4, eliminate.  Return
fire ineffective.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road</strong> move into position to eliminate NVA artillery.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road</strong> positioning for massive fire onslaught against
NVA artillery.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> lots going on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ARVN eliminate an NVA artillery which was foolishly placed in a
wall corner.</li>
  <li>ARVN Eliminated the rockets. Bad news for NVA.</li>
  <li>The NVA rockets took out a stack of ARVN armor/infantry which was in the clear.
ARVN considers this a pretty good trade.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="february-3-1968-nva-arms-itself-at-arvn-expense">February 3, 1968: NVA arms itself at ARVN expense</h2>

<p>The NVA get to rob the ARVN armory captured a couple of days ago. Roll 2
d6 for 8, this is needed firepower what with the majority of the
artillery eliminated. Also, roll 1 d6 or VC activation: 4. This is a
pretty sweet upgrade for the communist forces.</p>

<p><strong>NVA Move</strong> VC placed in inner city to deny key intersections to slow
down ARVN movement.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> No firing units this phase.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road move</strong> inner city ARVN positioning to take out VC road
blocks one at a time. US slight repositioning to eliminate VC in
southwest corner. Other ARVN positioning to clear bridges into inner
city.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road move</strong> Position to fight!</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> Lots of action all over the board. Overall, ARVN
got a couple of unlucky rolls, VC got a lucky roll.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-hue/hue_g1_feb3.jpg" alt="Battle for Hue February 3, 1968" /></p>

<p>Score: NVA 15 kills + 4 turns = 19, ARVN/US 13 kills.</p>

<p>The NVA has a long, long way to go, and there are a lot of Marines in

<h2 id="february-4-1968-arvn-brings-the-big-guns">February 4, 1968: ARVN brings the Big Guns</h2>

<p>Only 1 VC unit rolls in.</p>

<p><strong>NVA Move</strong> New VC unit replaces eliminated unit at bridge along north
wall of inner city. ARVN will have to continue fighting, or just use the
non-road movement to cross into the inner city.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> Tit for tat mostly. At this point, that's bad for
NVA.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road move</strong> The ARVN rolls in to inner city to destroy VC
roadblocks. The Marines flood the inner city using road movement now
that there is a bridge open.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road move</strong> Allies close to fight! VC unable to score on
first fire.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> Tit for tat on a VC/ARVN exchange, not a bad deal
considering the VC outgunned here. Much more bloodiness ensues. NVA
picks off one of the Marine armor units, and another Marine unit, but
lost one of the HACs.</p>

<p>3 VC rolled in.</p>

<p><strong>NVA Move</strong> At this point, lacking the artillery, and having one of the
HAC eliminated without being used, the NVA/VC are in a bind. Movement
this phase is positioning for attrition combat.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> NVA did not use artillery effectively, probably
cost it at least 1 Marine casualty.</p>

<p><strong>US/ARVN Road move</strong> Marines moving away from Palace of Peace for now,
toward ARVN 1st Div HQ, ARVN doing the same. Will attempt to "sweep up"
NVA units before assaulting the HQ.</p>

<p><strong>US/ARVN Non-road move</strong> Position for combat in urban terrain.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> NVA Lucky shot, took out 4-4 Marine infantry!
There was a 1/6 chance; the NVA are getting really lucky this game. The
Marines are getting totally pwned.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-hue/hue_g1_feb5.jpg" alt="Battle for Hue February 5, 1968" /></p>

<p>Score: NVA 6 + 20 + 12 = 38, ARVN/US 12 + 12 + 2 (HAC) = 26.</p>

<p>Those Marines add up fast for NVA scoring.</p>

<h2 id="february-6-1968">February 6, 1968</h2>

<p>I need to start timing my plays. Once I know how long a turn takes,
I can figure out how to squeeze in a turn or two at random intervals.</p>

<p>First, NVA reinforcements. Up to 3 units may enter on a die roll of 1,2 or 3.
The first 2 rolls are 5, the second is "3," so the NVA get an another
piece of artillery. Also, roll 2 d6 to determine how much of the NVA 324B
enters on February 6, <em>super</em> lucky roll, 11! Only 1 VC though.</p>

<p><strong>NVA Move</strong> Bring in new reinforcements on the southeast side of the map,
half to relieve the inner city, the other half to attempt to destroy artillery.
One 324B 2-4 lost right away one an attempt on the USMC MACV armory. Not sure
this is a good idea for NVA, but feels like it's worth trying. Probably could
have committed more than 2 units to the MACV, but risked losing all of them
on ZOC-controlled first fire.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> Eliminated the USMC unit on the
armory hex. Won't be able to hold it, but it's another 2 VP.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road Move</strong> At this point, the ARVN/US needs to be a little more
careful in how hard to commit. The game looks in favor of the NVA given the
huge commitment from 324B. Only road move for now is bringing ARVN support
for MACV defense.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road Move</strong> ARVN moves in to attack MACV attacker. No other
ARVN moves.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> Killed NVA threatening MACV, that danger is probably passed.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-hue/hue_g1_feb6.jpg" alt="Battle for Hue February 6, 1968" /></p>

<p>Turn time: 59:44, but I had to install gimp, and I went to refresh my
tea while that was happening. I'd say between 30-60 minutes per turn.</p>

<h5 id="score-1">Score:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>ARVN/US: 17 units + 12 VC = 29.</li>
  <li>NVA/VC: 7 turns + 22 ARVN + 7x2 USMC = 43.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is going to be bloody. And long.</p>

<h2 id="february-7-1968">February 7, 1968</h2>

<p>It's January 9, 2015.  Busy work schedule and personal stuff have limited my
time for working through this game for the last couple of weeks. I'm going to
try and get a turn or two in today.</p>

<p>Bringing in 3 USMC units 1 turn late.</p>

<p>Roll for VC: 2.</p>

<p><strong>NVA Move</strong> Sweeping around from the southeast to either put pressure on
ARVN artillery, or getting into inner to block further ARVN entrance.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> Limited fire this turn, but another ARVN eliminated.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road Move</strong> Position to stand outside of NVA range and pick
them off one by one. Allied forces have taken too many losses.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road Move</strong> Get observation, but don't close.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> Allied picked off some commies without any losses. Good day for
Allies.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-hue/hue_g1_feb7.jpg" alt="Battle for Hue February 7, 1968" /></p>

  <li>ARVN/US: 35.</li>

<p>Allied forces are gaining.</p>

<h2 id="february-8-1968">February 8, 1968</h2>

<p>Roll for VC: 6 (!)</p>

<p><strong>NVA/VC Move</strong> Position along south wall with NVA, and move southern
NVA artillery up with flanking defensive units for protection.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> Frontal attack on the southern wall by NVA, kills
another USMC artillery unit. This is really bad for Marines. Rolling
in 11 NVA makes up for the NVA losing some of their artillery earlier
in the game. Some no effect fires from VC, but ARVN managed to pick off
an NVA weapons company (3-6) on the north side, which is good for ARVN.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road Move</strong> ARVN and USMC need to be <em>really</em> careful and move
into positions which are not exposed, and which will be costly for NVA
to dig them out of.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road Move</strong> Moving ARVN to protect USMC, and to start
chewing away at the defense around the southern NVA artillery position.
This is cool for ARVN as these defenders are 2-4 infantry companies which
cannot call for support during second fire phase.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> ARVN succeed in killing 2-4 infantry NVA, which
puts the NVA arty under pressure now.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-hue/hue_g1_feb8.jpg" alt="Battle for Hue February 8, 1968" /></p>

<p>Turn time: 59:32. I'd like to get turn times down around 20 minutes. Seems
hard. The photo stuff takes no more than 10 minutes to handle, and usually
around 5. Similarly, the writeup doesn't take that much time either. It's
probably the combination of both which makes it add up. This really is going
to be a long slog, but that's how the Battle for Hue really was.</p>

<h5 id="score-3">Score</h5>

<ul>
  <li>NVA/VC: 48.</li>

<p>Roll for VC: 2.</p>

<p><strong>NVA/VC Move</strong> VC placed in the city blocks on the north side, west of
the ARVN 1st HQ. Good for soaking up attacks and running the clock. All
commie movement this turn is to avoid firefights.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> No fire.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road Move</strong> Allied forces moving much more cautiously now, focusing
on attrition without taking casualties on the south side of the map.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road Move</strong> Close on VC to clear roads allowing USMC movement
into inner city.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> Knocked off a few VC.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-hue/hue_g1_feb9.jpg" alt="Battle for Hue February 9, 1968" /></p>

<p>Turn time: 30:23. This turn went fast I think because there was no firefights
in the first fire phase, and very few in the second.</p>

<p><strong>NVA/VC Move</strong> VC move to assault USMC leg company 1/5.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> VC assault fails, more VC lost.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road Move</strong> ARVN artillery move to SE corner of inner city
to get half range distance from 1st Div HQ. ARVN reinforcements arrive
to keep pressure on NVA artillery in the south.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road Move</strong> Close to assault.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> Taking out NVA and VC at the 12+ column, auto-kills.
Takes longer but less risky to concentrate firepower.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-hue/hue_g1_feb10.jpg" alt="Battle for Hue February 10, 1968" /></p>

<p>Turn time: 30:49, which is doable.</p>

<p>Should be able to finish out the game over the rest of January easily. I was
getting worried I'd get too bored with the length of it and just take it down.
But I'm starting to get interested in how the siege on both the 1st ARVN HQ and
the Palace of Peace is going to play out. The HQ needs to go first to get rid
of the pesky VC rolls every turn.</p>

</ul>

<p>Tied game. I suspect the Allies will pull ahead for a bit,
then fall behind as the seiges get underway.</p>

<h2 id="february-11-1968">February 11, 1968</h2>

<p>Roll for VC: 4.</p>

<p><strong>NVA/VC Move</strong> Not much do to: get the artillery out of the way (or try),
and use the VC to wear down ARVN or USMC. Most all NVA need to hold tight
at this point.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> Some trading.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road Move</strong> Moving conservatively, taking on small parts of defense
instead of trying to engage everything possible. This helps NVA last more turns,
but keeps me from getting confused with too much action going down all at once.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road Move</strong> None this turn, not necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> More NVA artillery eliminated, bad luck for NVA, rolled
"6" to miss on an +10. Bummer. Actually, would not have mattered as the 2-4
unit would not have been able to call in the indirect fire.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> NVA and VC got lucky, took out USMC 2/5 leg,
at no cost, return fire missed.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road Move</strong> Primary move here is swapping out a 4-4
unit for the 3-8 unit in the MACV. That 3-8 is better used where it can
stand off and hammer targets from a long ways out. Also, move the
ARVN artillery back to get the 10+ range, and the USMC artillery up
to get within 20 hex range.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road Move</strong> Close in east and north, NVA misses on all
first fire after close.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> Attrition comtinues. ARVN tooks some losses, but
it can better afford them. NVA cannot afford to take losses at this point.</p>

<p>Turn time: 35:48</p>

<p>At this point, I don't see how the NVA can win it, because they have much fewer forces
than the Allies, and staying within the inner city would result in them being
ZOC'ed in. But where they're at right now guarantees a siege, which is also a
loss, and possibly sooner than chasing all over the map.</p>

<p>From here out, my interest is how well the siege works, from both attacker
and defender points of view. I think this will bring the game to a faster
conclusion than having the NVA foxing around the map, however more historically
accurate that might be.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road Move</strong> Positioning for a big push for driving out NVA from 
both Palace of Peace and 1st Div HQ.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road Move</strong> Closing to assault on Palace of Peace and armory.
NVA got really lucky rolling a 1 to remove a 4-4 USMC with 1-4 unit, then
rolled a 1 to remove an ARVN from a built-up city hex with a 2-4 unit.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> NVA kicked major ass this turn.</p>

<p>Turn time: Did not time this turn.</p>

<h4 id="score-10">Score</h4>

<ul>
  <li>NVA/VC: 33 ARVN + 11x2 USMC + 16 turns = 71.</li>
  <li>ARVN/US: 40 VC + 36 NVA + 2x2 HAC = 80.</li>
</ul>

<p>NVA isn't done yet! I can see how the game could be dragged out at least
a few more turns, but I'm kind of bored with it at this point.</p>

<p>Also, I still haven't used the naval gunfire.</p>

<h2 id="february-16-1968">February 16, 1968</h2>

<p><strong>NVA/VC Move</strong> Some rearranging at the north end, putting a VC on the
1st Div HQ bunker. It survives 3 first fire attacks, which is pretty cool
as it likely adds a turn to the game. No movement in Palace of Peace.</p>

<p><strong>First Fire Phase</strong> The NVA and VC have a chance to get really lucky here,
or unlucky, we'll see how the die rolls. They got semi-lucky, the HAC
unit survived and took an ARVN unit.</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Road Move</strong> position for "final assault."</p>

<p><strong>ARVN/US Non-road Move</strong> Hopefully the final assault.
One first fire NVA 2-4 misses.</p>

<p><strong>Second Fire Phase</strong> HAC unit is out. NVA at north end reduced to a
single unit.</p>

<p>Turn time: did not time this turn.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-hue/hue_g1_feb16.jpg" alt="Battle for Hue February 16, 1968" /></p>

<h4 id="score-11">Score</h4>

<ul>
  <li>NVA/VC: 35 ARVN + 11x2 USMC + 17 turns = 74.</li>
  <li>ARVN/US: 38 NVA + 43 VC + 3x2 HAC = 87.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just for fun, I rolled a "3" on an attack at force 12 around Palace of Peace, which
would have eliminated final NVA unit in that area.</p>

<p>The final scores would have been something like 115-85 if it was
played all the way out such that the ARVN/US got the 20 point bonus
for clearning the inner city.</p>

<p>TODO: Post a note on the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/41835/paint-it-black-vietnam-era-wargames/page/1?">Vietnam BGG list</a>
for the Battle of Hue entry.</p>

<p>As usual for a first game, a lot of what I did was push counters around
to see what would happen. Between that and the blunders listed below,
there is surely vast opportunity for improving game play.</p>

<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>NVA need to protect artillery.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Clearly, the initial ARVN blunder was not packing in all available ARVN units
around the armory and 1st Div. HQ.</li>
  <li>Another ARVN/US blunder: not bringing reinforcements on Feb. 1 on
schedule. These units could have possibly taken out NVA artillery.</li>
  <li>Forgot about NVA artillery in the Palace of Peace on the first 2
turns.</li>
  <li>NVA blundered by not dropping as many bridges as possible using every
unit not tied up attacking the ARVN armory. Granted, blowing bridges is
an optional rule, and one would hope it's possible to win as NVA/VC
without blowing bridges, but it just seems to make good sense.</li>
  <li>ARVN 1st Div should have tried to blow the armory, although, the NVA
moved so fast and got so lucky they may not have been able to move
away in time.</li>
  <li>NVA made huge blunder by putting artillery in wall corner hexes, then
not moving them away, hence losing them to ARVN on turn 3.</li>
  <li>Forgot to roll for VC activation as a result of capturing the ARVN 1st
Div. HQ. I believe I missed only one turn though.</li>
  <li>Did not airlift ARVN on Feb. 3, despite having a clear airfield.
Conversely, did not block the arifield with VC or NVA to prevent
airlift.</li>
  <li>DRMs accumulate, and I've been Doing It Wrong for defensive positions in
behind walls in city hexes. For some reason I believed that was a +3
DRM, but it's really +4, as the wall is +2 and the city hex is +2.
This changes things quite a bit, as the odds shift towards the NVA/VC
defender from 5/6 to eliminate to 4/6. I can see why this game takes
so many turns: it's really tough to root out defenders.</li>
  <li>Remember that NVA 2-4 infantry can only spot on first fire phase, while
NVA 3-6 weapons can spot on both fire phases. This makes a difference
in play, and I'm sure that there were several Allied units knocked out
because of using NVA 2-4 spotting.</li>
  <li>Not bringing in naval gunfire on Turn 12.</li>
  <li>Torwards the end game, the VC could have made more blocking moves to
slow down ARVN retaking the 1st Div HQ. It wouldn't have changed the
outcome much, maybe swung it 10-15 points in favor of communists,
which would not have been enough.</li>
  <li>Not surrounding Palace of Peace with loads of units. The odds decrease
with units firing from outside the walls, but the problem with getting
inside the walls is losing units to first fire on ZOC entry, which is
what happened on Feb. 15 turn.</li>
  <li>Put a HAC unit in the Palace of Peace proper, and sell that thing dearly.
This could have increased NVA/VC score by a few points.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="handicapping">Handicapping</h3>

<p>Another cool thing about Battle for Hue is it admits two types of
handicapping immediately. The first is simply specifying the number of
VC coming in on February 1. The second is ???</p>

    <li id="fn:artillery-halved">
      <p>This was originally mis-computed as 12+ using the full strength of artillery against bunkers. The error was caught in Turn 2, and it turns out changing the first die roll from "4" to "3" leaves all results unchanged, so I decided to let it stand. Also, as noted in the "Blunders," the artillery in the Palace of Peace wasn't used, and would have given just enough to tip the firepower to the 12+ column.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:artillery-halved" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
