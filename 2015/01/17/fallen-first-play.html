                Fallen first play
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 17 2015</time>
              <p>For some reason, I've lately had problems with attention span.
              I set up a game, play enough of it to learn the rules, then I'm
              bored or stressed and don't feel like continuing.</p>
              
              <p>I believe this may be in part due to current project at work,
              which is taking much longer than it should (in my opinion).
              The scope of the work seems to increase the longer I work on it,
              so every time I think I have a handle on it, I end up finding
              another week's worth of effort is necessary. Along with that,
              stuff in my personal life is becoming very stressful. Without
              going into details, it's stuff that needs to get handled now
              or will be lost permanently. Add taxes and the usual end of year,
              start of year responsibilities, it adds up to a lot of distraction
              exactly when I need to be able to <em>really</em> decompress.</p>
              
              <p>Anyway, the Fallen Kickstarter finally shipped, and I have the game
              set up for the first time. So far, I'm really impressed. The
              production values are outstanding, and half way through the first
              "stroy card," the game play is pretty good as well.</p>
              
              <p>There is a lot going on in this games, and a lot of ways for both
              sides to come from behind.</p>
              
              <h2 id="two-stories-in">Two stories in</h2>
              
              <p>At the end of the second story, the game is nominally half over.
              There are three stories and one "final battle," obviously, not
              sure how long the final battle will take to play out.</p>
              
              <p>So far, the DL is ahead, and the Hero is in the hurt locker. I
              don't see how to turn it around, but there's enough dice rolling
              to make it possible. I'm not playing the DL all that smart anyway.</p>
              
              <h2 id="final-challenge">Final Challenge</h2>
              
              <p>The DL won the game, in part due to some super crappy rolls from
              the Hero.</p>
              
              <p>But it was pretty fun. Will be a great game to play with a good friend.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
