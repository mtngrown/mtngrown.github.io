                Lynn Willis' Olympica
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb  4 2015</time>
              <p>Back in the late 70s and early 80s, Austin-based Metagaming issued
              a series of "microgames" of varying quality. Supposedly, Olympica is
              one of their better microgames. The designer, Lynn Willis, is also
              known for "Bloodtree Rebellion," which evidently had a strong influence
              on Nick Karp's "Vietnam 1965-1975."</p>
              
              <p>Lacking any better notion of what to do, here's my initial setup
              for a solo game:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Olympica Initial Setup" src="/images/olympica/g1_setup.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>The red-orange hexes containing "hills" are <em>incline</em> hexes. The
              yellow hexes with three waves are <em>cliff</em> hexes. The yellow hexes
              with stipples in the middle area is the "caldera" portion where the
              web generator must be located.</p>
              
              <p>The flipped counters are the web faction, the white face up counters
              are the UN faction. The map was downloaded from the web, very nice
              other than missing three hexes of cliff in one spot.</p>
              
              <p>Before getting started, let's jot down some notes on turn sequence
              and related rules.</p>

              <p>Let's get this started.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Section 14.2 p. 16 deals with drop compulsion. One drop is within 2
              hexes, so the web moves them back 3 hexes, putting all the units in the
              drop into two incline and one cliff hexes. Rolling for avalanche, 5,
              no avalanche. Drop is safe, albeit the movement restrictions on incline
              and hex put these units out of action.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Sections 19. and 19.2, p. 20 define regular compulsion. Web chooses to
              move one of the Laser Tanks 3 spaces into incline hexes.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <h5 id="b-tunnel-phase-1">B. Tunnel Phase</h5>
              
              <p>No tunneling this game.</p>
              
              <h5 id="c-reinforcement-phase-1">C. Reinforcement Phase</h5>
              
              <p>No reinforcements yet.</p>
              
              <h5 id="d-movement-phase-1">D. Movement Phase</h5>
              
              <p>Section 7.0, p. 9 of the rules for movement, Section 11, p. 12
              for Close Assaults.</p>
              
              <p>In this turn, 56web units are going for close assault.</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Roll 5, DE.</li>
                <li>Roll 1, pass to defender, roll 5 attacker eliminated. Which was good for
              UN as this was a Laser Tank.</li>
                <li>Roll 5, DE.</li>
                <li>Oops, this was a strong point, should not have been moved, now exposed.</li>
                <li>Roll 6, one Laser Tank eliminated.</li>
                <li>Roll 4, heavy infantry eliminated.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>So, 4 UN units eliminated at the cost of 1 Web unit. Bummer for UN.</p>
              
              <p>I can see how this plays out I think, it's all about positioning for that
              close assault, with the web having some advantage due to freely moving
              through all terrain.</p>
              
              <h5 id="e-ranged-combat-phase-1">E. Ranged Combat Phase</h5>
              
              <p>Section 10, p. 11.</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>2:1 roll 1, AR2, this clears a bunch of Web forces away allowing
              possible UN advance to Web Generator. Web forces could have used
              Strongpoint on this attack, but overlooked it (blunder).</li>
                <li>1:1 Strongpoint on Laser Tank, roll 6, exchange. In this case, the SP
              is eliminated because it is within the laser tanks range.</li>
                <li>2:1 roll 4, DR2, light infantry unit moved away from action.</li>
                <li>4:1 roll 4, DE.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h5 id="f-dust-removal-phase-1">F. DUST Removal Phase</h5>
              
              <p>Remove DUST markers placed in previous turn, not this turn.</p>
              
              <p>This thing is bloody.</p>
              
              <h4 id="ii-un-player-1">II. U.N. Player</h4>
              
              <h5 id="a-drop-phase-1">A. Drop Phase</h5>
              
              <p>Since UN player dropped all unit during setup, there is nothing
              to drop for this phase.</p>
              
              <h5 id="b-movement-phase-1">B. Movement Phase</h5>
              
              <p>Get in close to the Web Generator.
              One unit decided to CAT an SP but rolled avalanche (6) on cliff
              entry. Bummer. Two Close Assaults:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Roll 5, DE.</li>
                <li>Roll 2, DR2, moved Web force directly away from Generator.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h5 id="c-ranged-combat-phase-1">C. Ranged Combat Phase</h5>
              
              <ol>

                <li>2:1 roll 4, DR2.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h5 id="d-dust-removal-phase-1">D. DUST Removal Phase</h5>
              
              <p>Nothing to remove on first turn.</p>
              
              <h5 id="e-second-movement-phase-and-close-assaults-1">E. Second Movement Phase and Close Assaults.</h5>
              
              <p>Light Infantry (LI) get to move and CAT again. This is good to know,
              makes LI worth having and spending wisely instead of using for
              cannon fodder.</p>
              
              <p>Here's what the end of Turn 1 looks like:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Olympica Turn 1" src="/images/olympica/g1_t1.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>As usual, I have time to play mostly in the evening or at night,
              when getting pictures is really hard. It's very difficult to
              control the shadows.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

                <li>Sections 19. and 19.2, p. 20 define regular compulsion.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Two choices here:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Move the LT, or</li>
                <li>move one of the HI which are threatening the Web Generator.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>I think the right thing to do here is move the HI out 3 spaces, which
              will put it another turn away from the WG.</p>

              <p>This turn just going to play it out fast, no need to record everything,
              as it's most likely a draw, but we'll see what the dice say. The Web
              strategy it to CAT all three UN, and follow up with ranged attack. That
              should eliminate at least two, with a good chance of putting any remaining
              as DR 2.</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>CAT against Laser Tank, roll 1, noooo! LT rolls 4, attacker eliminated, LT
              still on the board.</li>
                <li>Roll 2, DR 2, which is 2 spaces into incline, that UN unit is done for this game.</li>
                <li>Roll 6, DE.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Ranged combat is against Laser Tank, roll 4, AR2, and Web is done.</p>
              
              <p>Only the Laser Tank remains, and it does a close assault.</p>
              
              <p>And it turns out I've been playing this wrong the whole time. In a close
              assault, <em>the defender gets to roll first!</em></p>
              
              <p>That sure explains why this game has been so bloody.</p>
              
              <p>Anyway, the Laser Tank is going to go for it, because the game is a draw
              anyway, and this might pull out a win, if the Dice Gods smile. So, move
              Laser Tank on to WG, defender rolls 5, Laser Tank eliminated!</p>
              
              <p>Game over, draw.</p>

              <p>I'm playing this again with AW in a few days. He's made noises about
              building a "large" copy of this game, which, given his Iron Mountain
              Ogre build, might be pretty impressive. We'll see. It will be fun to
              play an opponent in any case.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
