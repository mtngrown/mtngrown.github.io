                Kasserine Pass OCS style
              </h1>

              <hr />
              <p><i>
              Some notes on how I'm playing this first game:</i></p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Combat mode only. I don't think the Germans can even come close to
              winning this unless they use movement mode, possibly even strat mode,
              but I want to play it out anyway to see what happens.</li>
                <li>Trace supply only. I realize this totally breaks the whole notion of
              OCS, but there are a lot of other mechanics in the OCS rules which I
              would like to master first. For example, the basic movement, combat
              and ZOC rules will provide enough challenge for this first play.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><i>
              The result of these simplifications will be interesting, and likely
              worthy of some discussion.</i></p>
              
              <p><i>The risk is that I will learn the rules "wrong," and have to unlearn to
              proceed further. But the rules aren't so much the issue as learning bad
              strategy and tactics. Still, trying to digest the whole of OCS rules all
              at once is just a little much.</i></p>
              
              <p><i>What the system needs is a set of scenarios like Operation Starlite in
              Vietnam 1965-1975, a single turn (or 2 or 3) with very low unit count
              and simple victory conditions. These scenarios don't even need to be
              balanced. Central America Scenario 1 is similar.

              <p>I'm taking on the three turn Kasserine scenario in Tunisia. This is going
              to take quite a while I'm sure, but what's not started never finishes.</p>
              
              <p>Because the phasing is so complicated, it won't be listed out here
              initially. The focus instead is on basic moving and shooting, and
              fitting the supply constraints for both.</p>
              
              <p>The Axis need to get enough force through Tebessa while stopping
              defensive action by US and French forces (but mostly US). How they do
              this is the central puzzle to this situation.</p>

              <p>The stack with the 185th artillery is misplaced. It was just plopped down on the map
              during the initial setup lacking any better notion of what to do. The hill might
              be a great place for the artillery, but not for the supplies and organic truck
              underneath it.</p>
              
              <p>Notes:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Superga is in supply by scenario if it can trace to A46.08, which is its
              starting location.</li>
                <li>
                  <p>Roll for surprise: 7 + 4, so no surprise either way.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Attacking, action rating 3:
                  <ul>
                    <li>136th Assault Gun Batt. CF3 x 2 for armor in the open: 6</li>
                    <li>1st Assault Gun Batt. CF2 x 2 for armor in the open: 4</li>
                    <li>91st Inf. Reg. 4</li>
                    <li>Total: 14</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Defending, action rating 3:
                  <ul>
                    <li>135th Inf. Reg. (34th Inf): 6</li>
                    <li>889 Anti tank Batt.: 5</li>
                    <li>Total: 11</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Odds are 1:1, no drm, roll 8 open terrain <code>AL1Do1</code>. In this case, I'll
              take a step loss for each, allowing the defender to hold the ground.
              The two units taking the step loss are 899th Antitank Batt. for the Allies,
              and the 1st Assault Gun Batt. for the Italians.  Since
              the Superga doesn't have enough MP to continue the overrun, this combat
              is over.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Possible blunder: the 91st Reg. probably didn't have enough movement to participate
              in this overrun. Oops.</p>
              
              <p>Continuing on with Axis movement phase, next up is 10th Pz.</p>
              
              <p><strong>10th Pz</strong> is sitting on 8 SP, and I believe the first thing I can do is spend an
              SP and fuel up the entire division. Some other things to note are that the US
              is pretty strong at Sidi Bou Zid, and the US 1st Armor did well there
              historically.  10Pz has a huge supply dump in its rear area, so it can't really
              go driving around the US. It's going to have to find a way to either clear or
              keep the US occupied while 15Pz is operating in its rear area. The choice is
              made: engage the US with 10 Pz.</p>
              
              <p><strong>21 Pz</strong> is directly south of the US, and it chooses to move to engage 1st Armor
              as well. Both 10 and 21 Pz stay in combat mode.</p>
              
              <p><strong>15 Pz</strong> is the tough one for me: I have no idea what to do with this
              division. Recap: raod movement is 1/3 MP on primary road, 1/2 MP on
              secondary road. The Italians head north to attempt to flank 1 Army units
              to prevent them from moving west through Kasserine. The rest of 15 Pz
              moves northwest to Fériana to blast the Rangers and the French
              out of the way.</p>
              
              <p>This conclude Axis movement phase, now it's time to check for Trace
              Supply.</p>

              strength 19, no armor or mechanized bonus as the fight is on hill

              <p>Units from the Fériana attack move to west of Thelepte to confront a
              huge stack of US 1st Army armor lodged in the valley. Nothing else seems
              viable, the US units are too strong to attack with defenive strength 15.
              The armor shift does allow doubled for mech as well, but only for
              attack. Actually it would go 3:1 in open terrain…let's do it…no
              surprise…roll 9 + 2 on 3:1 (open) <code>Ao1DL1o1</code> works for me…Germans
              take the loss in the 605 PJ, Allies in 81 Recon. The Allies take the
              retreat, leaving behind a truck and 1SP. Since we're not concerned with
              supply this game, it's not a problem.</p>
              
              <p>But let's take a look at capture rules. First, we need to deal with the
              truck. Aha. The truck is organic to 1st Army so it will retreat along
              with it (9.12d Tagalongs).</p>

              supply. Raw odds are 16:10 accounting for doubled armor bonus with
              halved attack factor from out of supply, which is 2:1. Need 8 for
              surprise, roll 3 shift 6, bummer because this is defender surprise
              which is going to roll on the 1:5 table. Germans need high, roll 9 + 2

              US in any case. Odds 13:1 with armor bonus to Italians, roll snake
              eyes shift 1 for surprise! Dang! At least it's only a single shift
              left, but it moves from the 13:1 column to the 11:1 column, roll 5 + 3
              yield 8 <code>Ae4DL1o2</code>. Will hold tight on the attacking hex to exploit

              which will be helpful. Probably won't go well for the Germans.
              Raw odds 15:12, with armor factor 26:12 for 2:1, AR +2 German favor,
              roll for surprise, fail, roll combat 9 + 2 yields <code>Ao1Do1</code>, attacker
              choose to retreat. This should have actually been fought on the Close
              odds at 1:1 which nullifies the armor factor as the defender chose to
              fight from rough terrain. That yields <code>AL1Do1</code>. Bummer. Germans are

                  <p>The Italians chose not to advance after combat, and will use this
              exploit phase to close with US 3-1 armor and 91 Art. As understand it,
              only 14 Bn armor will be able to overrun as it has 6 MP. The mech unit
              is in leg mode with 3 MP, and the last unit is 131 Art. which is also in
              leg mode for 3 MP. Attacking we have 4 x 2 for 8 against 6+1 which is
              1:1, roll for surprise need 8 rolled snakes and 1. This is the second
              time I've rolled 3 1s on surprise. Could be worse, could have been
              1,1, shift 6. Combat roll 11 (!) + 1 for 12 on the 1:2 table in Open
              yields <code>Ao1DL1o1</code>. The Italians will take the loss to enforce the <code>o1</code>
              on the defender, which is 91 SP Art Bn having to retreat through EZOC
              of 3/21 Pz (Recon) Bn. It's a pity the other two Italian units can't
              participate in the overrun, but I'm now wondering if they can actually
              move during the movement phase. That feels a bit like cheating, but
              still, it would be good to know. They could likely move elsewhere and
              attack, but that could be dicey. Actually the 131 Art. could barrage
              with 7 costing 2T, so let's try it, need a 9 or more, roll 6, no dice.</p>
              
                  <p>The Italians are done.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Germans at Sbeitla have 1-7 Pz and 10 armored Recon both from 10 Pz
              which will continue their attack on 65 SP Art. This is an overrun in
              the clear with armor against a DF 1 artillery unit, AR is +5 so
              minimum roll is 6 which is a <code>DL1</code> for 65 SP. The German units have MP
              8 and get 8/2 for exploit movement, and spend 3 MP to advance into the
              vacated hex. If they had more movement, they could continue the
              overrun against the US 1-1 armor Bn. They will instead fight. Putting
              10 Bn in lead with AR 5 against defending AR 2 roll for surprise get
              2,2 no surprise. Raw odds 22:4 which is 4.5:1 which is 5:1 in open
              terrain roll 7 + 3 for 10 yields <code>Ae4Dl1o2</code>. The Germans are cleaning
              up. However, this unit will be out of supply next German phase.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Germans at Thelepte, move towards Kasserine, except no, they can't as
              these units are all leg movement with 3 MP, so they move up the road
              to Dernia to face off against the French blocking the pass to Tebessa.
              Attacking here would be at 1/2 strength, with 2:1 final odds fighting
              in close terrain. Would have to roll a 6 to prevent any German loss.
              I could pay 4T for a huge barrage with a 6+ to DG, but the US forces
              could easily nullify any gains here by moving units up from Tebessa.
              Let's try it anyway, surprise roll 8, yes, shift 1 (?! jeebus this is
              like the 4th time in a row the red shift die has rolled a 1). So the
              attack is at 3:1 in close, roll 9 + 2 yields <code>Ao1DL1o1</code> which is fine,
              the Germans will take a 1 hex retreat here: the road over the
              mountains is open, at least for now.</p>

              <p>And that's a wrap. The Tebessa fight boiled down to the luck of the die,

              result, then exploit successfully.</p>

              <p>As can be seen, the Germans did not achieve their goals.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>A win for the Allies.</p>
              
              <p>What's crystal clear after Turn 1 is that there is no way for the
              Germans to achieve victory conditions using only combat mode with
              "strict" EZOC. They must go into movement mode and figure out how to
              swing around EZOCs to position themselves appropriately. The Allies, on
              the other hand, can move into blocking positions while staying in combat
              mode. This makes it even harder for the Germans as they will have to
              defend in move mode.</p>
              
              <p>I suspect that getting the first turn right will allow the Germans to
              conduct the remaining two turns in combat mode, providing they can
              survive the Allies first turn counter attacks. If the Germans can get
              the Allies rocked back a bit, and keep up the momentum, they may be able
              to succeed.</p>
              
              <h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>
              
              <p>Manifold and varied.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 1, the primary blunder was <em>not</em> putting the mechanized infantry
              into Truck mode and getting them around the back of the French at
              Fériana to cut off retreat and protect trace supply. A related blunder
              was not putting the leg infantry into strat mode for the same reason.
              I think this is just 1 para unit attached to 15 Pz, but it still would
              have been very useful to have on the next turn, given that it would be
              well-protected by the mechanized units. Acually, this wasn't a
              blunder, I'm specifically playing this game in combat mode only.
              But this would be a blunder if I were using all modes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Not using EZOC negation to get 10 Pz around Sidi Bou Zid. In truth,
              this won't matter as much with only combat mode. Using a move mode,
              this would be imperative. That would have the added benefit of putting
              the US units there out of supply.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>In the combat following exploitation (Turn 1), one of the US units is
              tracked artillery, with strength of 6. This may not have been allowed
              in the battle without spending extra supply is there had been supply.
              This would have put the odds at 5:1 for <code>Ae4DL1o2</code>, significantly
              different! However, I think since the Combat factor is not
              parenthesized, I did it right.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Units retreating 2 steps go into DG mode (5.10a.B). The French unit

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
