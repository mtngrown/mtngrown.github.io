Vietnam Solitaire first play
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 15 2015</time>
<p>In my quest to acquire a broad selection of English-language games
on Vietnam, I picked up the Special Edition of <em>Vietnam Solitaire</em>.
The original game is a $4 print-and-play. This one features extended
rules, 88 laser cut counters (thick!) and additional scenarios.</p>

<p>I'm not going to take a lot of notes on this play. Mostly will limit
myself to a few remarks per turn.</p>

<h4 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h4>

<p>Bombed the trail and did some combat with ARVN. Managed to
remove some VC.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/vietnam-solitaire/g1_turn1.jpg" alt="End of Turn 1" /></p>

<p>Political Points at 6. Not a good start!</p>

<h4 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h4>

<p>(I forgot to roll for Political Events.)</p>

<p>Phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Trail</strong> Rolled 1,1 for placing Trail counters, but there is already trail in
  Haiphong, lucky.</li>
  <li><strong>Attack Trail</strong> Green Beret roll 3 against Laos, no effect, and 2 against Hanoi,
  remove Hanoi trail marker. Advance PP by 2.</li>
  <li><strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN</strong> Put a few on the map to attempt to get some PP back by
  clearing occupied areas.</li>
  <li><strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong> VC rolls a 1, takes out an ARVN unit in Mekong, bummer. US take out that VC though.</li>
  <li><strong>Place VC/NVA</strong> VC placed into Highlands Area 5. NVA placed in Area 6 of Hue as
  only the Haiphong Trail is active.</li>
  <li><strong>Insurgency Combat</strong> none this turn.</li>
  <li><strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong> Roll 5, Mekong, no NVA or VC present, no offensive.</li>
  <li><strong>Air Cav Movement</strong> None on the map this turn.</li>
  <li><strong>Victory Check</strong> Mekong and Saigon are free of Communist forces, move PP back
  to 8. Political Events roll 5, no US/Allied ground units next turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>Last turn, I also carried the Political Points forward, which is a mistake,
it's to be reset at the current game turn. This really changes everything,
because I was at 9 political points, and really couldn't see how it would be
possible <em>not</em> to get creamed inside of 4-5 turns. So that makes more sense.</p>

<h4 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h4>

<p>Since the Political Points get reset after each turn, it's time to call in
the Cavalry, the Air Cav to be precise, which is expensive at 3 PP per unit.
Except, bummer, political roll means cannot emplace US/ARVN ground troops
this turn.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Trail</strong> Roll 3 and 6.</li>
  <li><strong>Attack Trail</strong> Since no US/ARVN ground troops can be placed this turn,
going all out on the trail. Trail marker removed from Haiphong, remains
in Laos, removed from Cambodia.</li>
  <li><strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN</strong> no ground troops allowed this turn.</li>
  <li><strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong> no ground troops allowed this turn.</li>
  <li><strong>Place VC/NVA</strong> VC placed in Northern Saigon. NVA placed in Area 3-4
of Highlands.</li>
  <li><strong>Insurgency Combat</strong> no insurgency this turn.</li>
  <li><strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong> NVA offensive in Region 1, Hue. ARVN make no hit,
lose 1 of 2 units, retreat to the Area 5 box.</li>
  <li><strong>Air Cav Movement</strong> no air cav units on the map.</li>
  <li><strong>Victory Check</strong> Only Mekong free of Communist forces, PP at 9. Roll 3,
no Green Beret attacks next turn.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Trail</strong> roll 3, 6, add Trail to Cambodia.</li>
  <li><strong>Attack Trail</strong> B52 on Laos, roll 2, remove; B52 Cambodia roll 4 remove.
There are no trail markers down.</li>
  <li><strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN</strong> Air Cav in Area 1-2 Cu Chi, move ARVN to Area 1.
More ARVN in Hue and Highlands, might be a bad idea.</li>
  <li><strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong> VC eliminated from Cu Chi. VC eliminated from N. Saigon.</li>
  <li><strong>Place VC/NVA</strong> VC placed in Area 1 of Region 5 (Mekong). No trail on map,
so no NVA placed this turn.</li>
  <li><strong>Insurgency Combat</strong> None this turn.</li>
  <li><strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong> Roll 6, offensives in all Regions.
  * Hue: ARVN roll 1,2 (lucky) destroy 1 VC and 1 NVA, suffer 1 loss and retreat.
  * Highlands, VC roll 1,1 both ARVN destroyed! 1 VC destroyed.
  * Mekong: 1 VC destroyed.</li>
  <li><strong>Air Cav Movement</strong> Air Cav stays in Cu Chi.</li>
  <li><strong>Victory Check</strong> PP 15, busted. Should have let Hue and the Highlands alone,
losing all those ARVN units hurt.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Pretty cool little game. I like it enough to play it several more times,
and I think it's definitely beatable.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
