                Olympica Big Board
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 20 2015</time>
              <p>Played two games with AW at his place on his custom, homebuilt edition.
              His counters are nominally 1" square, and mounted on ~3/8" wood or particle
              backing. (I need to ask about this.) The map was pieced together from
              scrap book paper and mounted on semi-stiff backing which could be rolled
              up. I'm thinking this would be a nice piece of work for a fully mounted
              folding map board from Print and Play Productions.</p>
              
              <p>In any case, it was great playing on his copy.</p>
              
              <h2 id="game-1">Game 1</h2>
              
              <p>First game with AW. He set up Web forces very tightly, and my UN forces were
              able to smash through very quickly for a win. I dropped all my forces on the
              initial turn, and used the Light Infantry second movement phase to occupy the
              web generator. I believe I had the web generator occupied at the end of Turn 2
              (maybe Turn 1, can't recall exactly, but it was very early in the game).</p>
              
              <p>The UN was never able to recover.</p>
              
              <h2 id="game-2">Game 2</h2>
              
              <p>I took the Web this time around, and was able to hold off the UN forces until
              the end of Turn 3, finally losing on Turn 4 as AW dropped in the Light
              Infantry. I needed 3 lucky rolls in a row, didn't make the first two, conceded
              at the top of Turn 4.</p>
              
              <p>One bungle we made on this was DUSTing the Web strong points, but strong points
              are supposed to be N/E on DUST results. This may have cost me the game as the
              Web player.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>Olympica does feel slightly unbalanced as the UN has won pretty easily all 3
              games I've played. This is in part due to not having mastered the rules, for
              sure, but it still feels like new players would benefit from an extra Web
              infantry or two.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
