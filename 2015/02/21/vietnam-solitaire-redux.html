                Vietnam Solitaire Redux
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 21 2015</time>
              <p>Second play through of Vietnam Solitaire using the rules for the
              original game. I'm putting this game on my H-Index because it's fun
              enough to allow for at least a dozen plays. If my H-Index ever gets
              to 12, I'll re-evaluate it then.</p>
              
              <p>In the meantime, let's play game 2 a lot more aggressively than the first
              game. The strategy for this game will be to get as many of the Allied units
              on the board as fast as possible while minimizing NVA entry via trail. The
              B52 strikes to control the Trail are expensive, and will become prohibitive
              later in the game, so best to slow the NVA down as much as possible while
              using remaining political points to get the troops on the board.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Trail</strong> Roll 3,4 place in both Laos trail areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Attack Trail</strong> B52 cleared southern Laos, B52 and both Green Beret
              failed to clear N. Laos, cost 7 political points. Bummer.</li>
                <li><strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN</strong> ARVN into Hue City (Region 1, Area 3-40, Air Cav
              and US into Highlands 1-2. Risky, at 13 PP, better be lucky or game will
              end this turn!</li>
                <li><strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong> Remove VC from Highlands 1-2. This gives me a PP back, maybe.</li>
                <li><strong>Place VC/NVA</strong> VC placed into Region 1, Area 1-2. NVA placed into Highlands 3-4.
              This is an "uh oh."</li>
                <li><strong>Insurgency Combat</strong> Insurgency in Highlands, both roll 3, ARVN retreats to Area 5.</li>
                <li><strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong> Cu Chi, ARVN carries the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Cav Movement</strong> none this turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Victory Check</strong> Cu Chi has only ARVN, PP moves from 13 to 12 (whew!). Political
              Events roll 6 - 1 (Turn 1), no US/Allied ground units next turn. Bummer.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>I should have moved Air Cav to Region 5 in Highlands to guard against possible
              NVA offensive next turn.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
              
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Trail</strong> Roll 6, 2.</li>
                <li><strong>Attack Trail</strong> Cambodia B52, roll 6, again roll 4. Hanoi GB roll 1. Laos GB roll 2,
              Super lucky! This is the turn to spend these points as I can't place any ground troops.
              Except, bummer, can't use Green Beret in Hanoiâ€¦ I'll know next time.</li>
                <li><strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN</strong> none this turn.</li>
                <li><strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong> Napalm in Mekong, roll 5, miss, napalm in Hue Area 1-2 roll 3, 1
              VC eliminated. PP is 8.</li>
                <li><strong>Place VC/NVA</strong> VC placed in Hue Area 5, NVA Hue Area 1-2.</li>
                <li><strong>Insurgency Combat</strong> none.</li>
                <li><strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong> Roll 3, Cu Chi has no VC/NVA, no offensive this turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Cav Movement</strong> none this turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Victory Check</strong> Cu Chi has only ARVN, final PP for turn is 7. Political Events
              roll 2 - 1 Play As Normal. This is good as I'm going to try and get as many US
              and ARVN forces on the map as possible.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
              
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Trail</strong> roll 5, 6.</li>
                <li><strong>Attack Trail</strong> Hanoi B52 roll 4, N. Cambodia B52 roll 5, S. Cambodia GB roll 2.</li>
                <li><strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN</strong> ARVN in Hue, makes 3 in Hue City, should be safe for a few
              turns. Air Cav in Saigon Area 1-2 (rice paddy), another ARVN in Saigon Area 1-2.
              PP 13, risky.</li>
                <li><strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong> Saigon Area 1 roll 3, VC destroyed, roll 4 VC miss on return fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Place VC/NVA</strong> VC place Mekong Area 6. NVA place Saigon Area 2.</li>
                <li><strong>Insurgency Combat</strong> Saigon NVA roll 4 miss, Air Cav roll 6 miss, ARVN roll 4 miss,
              Allied forces retreat to Area 3-4.</li>
                <li><strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong> roll 4 Saigon area, NVA roll 2 eliminate ARVN (oh noes!), ARVN
              roll 5, 5, Air Cav roll 3, choose retreat, PP at 14.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Cav Movement</strong> 1st AC moves to Area 1-2 of Cu Chi.</li>
                <li><strong>Victory Check</strong> Cu Chi has only Allied force, PP back to 13. Whew. May need to start
              playing a little less aggressively. Political Events roll 4, no B52 or GB, which is fine
              because this lets me get the rest of my units on the board.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>I think I can hold out 3 turns pretty easy to at least get to the next to worst victory
              condition ("Hamburger Hill"). Possibly even a Draw.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>
              
              <p>I'm definitely doing better than the last game. I'm pretty sure if I just "skate"
              the next three turns I can pull out a marginal defeat. Probably take some work and
              some luck to get to the draw.</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Trail</strong> roll 4, 4 place one trail in S. Laos. Lucky, I'll take it.</li>
                <li><strong>Attack Trail</strong> none this turn, bummer.</li>
                <li><strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN</strong> 3 ARVN spread into Saigon, US in Saigon 1-2, Highlands 3-4,
              move Air Cav into Highlands 3-4.</li>
                <li><strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Highlands: NVA roll 4 miss, US roll 6 miss, Air Cav roll 3 NVA eliminated.</li>
                    <li>Saigon: NVA roll 1, ARVN eliminated, ARVN roll 1, 2 NVA eliminated. PP 13.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Place VC/NVA</strong> VC roll 5, Mekong Area 1-2. NVA from S. Laos into Cu Chi Area 3,
              N. Cambodia into Saigon Area 1-2.</li>
                <li><strong>Insurgency Combat</strong> Cu Chi NVA roll 5 miss, ARVN roll 6 miss and retreat to Area 5.
              Saigon NVA roll 1 eliminate 23rd Division, 23rd rolls 4, miss. PP at 15.</li>
                <li><strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong> Cu Chi NVA roll 4 miss, ARVN roll 6 miss and retreat to Area 6.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Cav Movement</strong> none.</li>
                <li><strong>Victory Check</strong> One region without VC/NVA moves PP counter to 14, game over. Bummer.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>I was too agressive this game, and not aggressive enough the first game. Will have to find
              the happy medium. I was just sure I was going to be able to get past Turn 4 this game.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
