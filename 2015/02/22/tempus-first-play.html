                Tempus and 7 Wonders first plays
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 22 2015</time>
              <p>About a half game at PL's Alameda last night. We had to teach ourselves
              the rules, it went slow. There were four of us, PL's brother and wife,
              roommate P, and myself.</p>
              
              <p>We got to Turn 6 by around 11 pm, at which point I was just too tired
              to deal with it, and everyone else at the party was sort of hanging
              around being distracting as they had already finished with their Dominion
              game.</p>
              
              <p>The game itself seems ok. I'm spoiled by wargames and heavier games, and
              this one is a bit light in comparison. The reviews are split pretty much
              50/50. I lot of people really like it, and a lot of people really dislike it.
              I'm in the middle, I don't like or dislike it much either way. It would
              be helpful to have started playing it much, much earlier in the evening,
              but it seem really difficult to get people in the mood for games until
              8 or 9 pm, then even more time to wrangle everyone into the same area
              and actually playing. This has definitely colored my opinion of the game
              negatively. But I think it would color my opinion of any game in the
              same circumstances. For example, Eldritch Horror suffered the same
              issue: we started far too late to really dig into the game.</p>
              
              <p>Today played 7 Wonders with BB and friends for the first time as well.
              Pretty light game, not bad at all for a small group. Lots of ways to
              win. I came in second by 1 point. It's not something I think I want to
              own, but I'll play it again with others.</p>

                  More PanzerBlitz. Situation 11 has not seen
                  any plays at all, and Situation 7 only a single solo play. Situations 10
                  and 12 have only been played FtF, without a detailed writeup.

                  Arab Israeli Wars is coming!

                <li>
                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
