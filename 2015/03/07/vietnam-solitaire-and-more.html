                Vietnam Solitaire (and more)
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar  7 2015</time>
              <p>Playing a quick game while getting the laundry done. The goal is getting
              past Turn 4, where I've been stymied on my two previous turns.</p>
              
              <p>This game, I decided to hold back a little instead of pushing hard to
              the limit of the political points, capping the per turn spend at 10-11
              if possible.</p>
              
              <p>More strategy:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Get the ARVN into cities and paddies as fast as possible.</li>
                <li>Ramp up US forces starting with Air Cav as it's the most expensive.</li>
                <li>Add US regular forces each turn into jungle, as ARVN does better than
              VC in paddies and cities.</li>
                <li>Use left points to handle the trail.</li>
                <li>Use napalm whenever there is a leftover point or two to eliminate
              VC in jungle areas.</li>
                <li>Get lucky with the dice.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Of all these, getting lucky with the dice has gotten the game through
              Turn 5 to the state in the picture below.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of Turn 5" src="/images/vietnam-solitaire/g3_t5.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Pretty nice. Should be able to get a draw without even doing much.
              I probably could have risked putting another napalm down given how much
              area I'm controlling, but that's not always clear during that phase when
              there are more VC/NVA on the map.</p>
              
              <p>The primary lucky I'm getting is good rolls for clearing Trail, and so far,
              neither VC nor NVA have taken more than a single ARVN off the map.</p>
              
              <p>This game went on to end on Turn 13, which is a major victory, majorly spoiled
              by the fact I forgot to roll for political events. This is important, as political
              events are almost uniformly bad, and make the game a bit more difficult.
              (Possibly a lot more difficult.) In any case, the strategy of getting
              as many units on the ground as early as possible seems to be the smart way
              to win the game even with policital points.</p>
              
              <h2 id="hapsburg-eclipse">Hapsburg Eclipse</h2>
              
              <p>Here's the card order: 50, 01, 04, 02, 09, 03, 11, 06, 16, 07, 15, 10,
              25, 21, 12, 18, 34, 19, 13, 30, 17</p>
              
              <p>Polish Front enters Vienna, game over. The Italians had advanced to Graz,
              which almost surely would have resulted in National Will defeat as well.
              I didn't total up points, but it's something like 5 victories, 3 defeats,
              7 flags passed on the fronts tracks, and 2 in revolt with about half the
              deck remaining. An average defeat, I would think, not totally, annihilated,
              but not really that close to victory either.</p>

              <p>Shooting for a political win on this game.</p>
              
              <p>Cards: 29, 23, 14, 7, 5, 11, 6, 3, 12, 1, 8 (Bukharin option for the political
              points), 25, 16, 2, 46, 35, 34 (Reorganize, acquire Comintern for +1 on
              political rolls), 15, 30.</p>
              
              <p>Card 30, Jassy Conference, won the game with the +1 DRM on political
              track with the +1 DRM from Comintern I got to 8 on the political
              track. I spent the action to roll a 6 for political advancement and
              victory.</p>
              
              <p>Victory level:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Fronts at 3, 3, 2: 8</li>
                <li>Fronts removed: 6</li>
                <li>Reserve and political remaining: 8</li>
                <li>Only Night cards added: 5</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Total: 27, Proud Soviet State.</p>

              <p>Counters are punched, the Sickle Cut game is set up, and there is a lot to
              absorb in the rules. I could start that here, but I think I want to get the
              writeup going in it's own article.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.

                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
