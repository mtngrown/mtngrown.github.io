                Vietnam Solitaire (and more)
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar  7 2015</time>
              <p>Playing a quick game while getting the laundry done. The goal is getting
              past Turn 4, where I've been stymied on my two previous turns.</p>
              
              <p>This game, I decided to hold back a little instead of pushing hard to
              the limit of the political points, capping the per turn spend at 10-11
              if possible.</p>
              
              <p>More strategy:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Get the ARVN into cities and paddies as fast as possible.</li>
                <li>Ramp up US forces starting with Air Cav as it's the most expensive.</li>
                <li>Add US regular forces each turn into jungle, as ARVN does better than
              VC in paddies and cities.</li>
                <li>Use left points to handle the trail.</li>
                <li>Use napalm whenever there is a leftover point or two to eliminate
              VC in jungle areas.</li>
                <li>Get lucky with the dice.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Of all these, getting lucky with the dice has gotten the game through
              Turn 5 to the state in the picture below.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of Turn 5" src="/images/vietnam-solitaire/g3_t5.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Pretty nice. Should be able to get a draw without even doing much.
              I probably could have risked putting another napalm down given how much
              area I'm controlling, but that's not always clear during that phase when
              there are more VC/NVA on the map.</p>
              
              <p>The primary lucky I'm getting is good rolls for clearing Trail, and so far,
              neither VC nor NVA have taken more than a single ARVN off the map.</p>
              
              <p>This game went on to end on Turn 13, which is a major victory, majorly spoiled
              by the fact I forgot to roll for political events. This is important, as political
              events are almost uniformly bad, and make the game a bit more difficult.
              (Possibly a lot more difficult.) In any case, the strategy of getting
              as many units on the ground as early as possible seems to be the smart way
              to win the game even with policital points.</p>
              
              <h2 id="hapsburg-eclipse">Hapsburg Eclipse</h2>
              
              <p>Here's the card order: 50, 01, 04, 02, 09, 03, 11, 06, 16, 07, 15, 10,
              25, 21, 12, 18, 34, 19, 13, 30, 17</p>
              
              <p>Polish Front enters Vienna, game over. The Italians had advanced to Graz,
              which almost surely would have resulted in National Will defeat as well.
              I didn't total up points, but it's something like 5 victories, 3 defeats,
              7 flags passed on the fronts tracks, and 2 in revolt with about half the
              deck remaining. An average defeat, I would think, not totally, annihilated,
              but not really that close to victory either.</p>

              <p>Shooting for a political win on this game.</p>
              
              <p>Cards: 29, 23, 14, 7, 5, 11, 6, 3, 12, 1, 8 (Bukharin option for the political
              points), 25, 16, 2, 46, 35, 34 (Reorganize, acquire Comintern for +1 on
              political rolls), 15, 30.</p>
              
              <p>Card 30, Jassy Conference, won the game with the +1 DRM on political
              track with the +1 DRM from Comintern I got to 8 on the political
              track. I spent the action to roll a 6 for political advancement and
              victory.</p>
              
              <p>Victory level:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Fronts at 3, 3, 2: 8</li>
                <li>Fronts removed: 6</li>
                <li>Reserve and political remaining: 8</li>
                <li>Only Night cards added: 5</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Total: 27, Proud Soviet State.</p>

              <p>Counters are punched, the Sickle Cut game is set up, and there is a lot to
              absorb in the rules. I could start that here, but I think I want to get the
              writeup going in it's own article.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
