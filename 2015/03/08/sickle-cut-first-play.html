Sickle Cut First Play
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar  8 2015</time>
<p>Since CC purchased this as his first game back into wargaming, I went
ahead and picked it up as well. Production-wise, it's the usual very
high quality GMT product.</p>

<p>Game play is substantially more intricate than the previous games we've
played, which include <em>Race for Tunis, Bloody Kasserine</em> and a few of
similar, rather light complexity. In fact, I've read that some consider
<em>Race for Tunis</em> and <em>Bloody Kasserine</em> to be more "beer and pretzels"
complexity than not. <em>France '40</em> is at least 2-3 factors more complex
than either of those.</p>

<p>Let's get started with turn order:</p>

<h2 id="sequence-of-play">Sequence of play</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">(Turn 1) Provide a broad description of the situation, and some notion of the

<h3 id="end-phase">End Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Move the game turn counter and proceed to next turn.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>In the early game, the Germans focus on clearing a way across the Meuse,
the Allies (Frech mostly) on preventing the Germans from breaking through.
The earlier the Germans can break through, the easier it will be to cross
the map to Abbeville and cut the supply lines.</p>

<h3 id="german-player-turn-1">German Player Turn 1</h3>

<p>The focus on this turn is understanding the combat system, and learning
the various options with respect to the initial German position.</p>

  <li>Compute Automatic DS (10.1, 14.2)</li>
</ul>

<p>Goal is to get across the Meuse as fast as possible. It's very difficult to
attack across, because defense is doubled and attacks are halved, which leads
to the case where an otherwise 4:1 turns into a 1:1.</p>

  <li>

  <li>

<p>March 14, 2015: I've been busy at work, and it's been difficult to muster the amount of
energy necessary to properly work through this initial learning game.</p>

<p>This early in the game, the goal is to make the Huns pay as high a cost as possible
for advancing, which means falling back slowly in the north, holding fast in the south
around Sedan.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>The situation is tense, with no clear advantage to either combatant. The Germans
are held at the Meuse at Sedan, where the French are relatively weak, but have
broken through south of Namur, where the French and Belgians are somewhat stronger.</p>

<h3 id="german-player-turn-2">German Player Turn 2</h3>

<p>In the south, after getting a bloody nose trying to cross the Meuse at
Sedan, the Germans are going to hold Sedan and race north into the
Ardennes where the French line is really weak. Provided they can punch
through there, the plan is to circle back south and clear out the French
around Charleville to open a gaping hole in the French line.</p>

<p>In the north, the situation is not quite so clear. The Dyle line is
could be pretty tough to crack, although once cracked, would really
put the hurt on the defensive line.</p>

<h4 id="german-initial-phase-2">German Initial Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Flip all Air units from Used to Ready side.</p>

  <li>Compute Automatic DS (10.1, 14.2)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm finding it difficult to keep track off all the movement and rules
for movement.</p>

<p>In the north, 5th and 7th Pz (with Rommel) go all out to crack the French line
southwest of Namur, and to breach the Dyle Line.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/g1_t2_gm.jpg" alt="Germans in the north" /></p>

<p>If Inkscape would start, I'd annotate the above image with some remarks
about what's going on. Until then, description will have to do.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Blunder on French positioning which didn't matter for this game, but
is important to note: the 2 DLM armor should be one more hex
northwest, on the rail line, to create the hexside bond with the map
edge. This does put it in a more exposed position, but it also makes
it more difficult for the Germans to get into the north end of the
Dyle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 Pz and 4 Pz expose another blunder in the Allied set up in Namur.
Fortifications don't exert a ZOC unless occupied. Since there are no
units occupying the forts on the north side of Namur, these 2 Pz and 4
Pz may well be able to crack the Dyle right here. We'll see how it
plays out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 Army HQ is more than 7 hexes from French 12 Mech on the Dyle. Teh 12
is not going to get an HQ shift. 1 Army will shift against Rommel's
fight against 1 and 4 Cav southeast of Charleroi, but this is probably
not as important as holding the Dyle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>German extended move error for 28 and 32 Inf, they are not allowed to
close on extended move as shown in this image occupying Hex 5206. For
game play they got moved back to 5207.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the Ardennes, the French 32d armor battalion is going to get hammered by
6 Pz and elements of 1 Pz and 10 Pz. There will be an automatic DS
result from this movement.</p>

<p>In the south, position mechanized and armor to exploit Ardennes
breakthrough, while using infantry divisions to protect supply lines.</p>

<h4 id="german-combat-phase-2">German Combat Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German player conducts all attacks (8.0) including Overruns
(15.0) and Disengagement Attempts (20.4).</p>

<p>As it turns out, the best the Germans can do against 12 Mech is 3:1,
which stands a very high chance of hurting the Germans pretty badly
if it went into Determined Defense (likely). So, postpone that for a
turn. It's not clear whether this whole Dyle line thing is worth
breaking or not, but the Germans bring a lot of reinforcements behind
it, and it would be nice not to have to run around south of Namur.</p>

<p>Rommel's attack went A1/D1 at 6:1. 1/3 chance of a DS here, bummer. The
French are doing well in these fights; the Germans are rolling very
poorly.</p>

<p>1 and 10 Pz exploit the DS for a breakthrough and advance well out of
the Ardennes.</p>

<p>6 Pz hurt the French 61 Inf with a D1 on 4:1, the resulting bonus (4
hex) advance puts 6 Pz in position to do it again, as 61 Inf is GQG.
This also threatens 9 Army HQ, which needs to move.</p>

<p>The situation down at Sedan is just too difficult for the Germans.
Best bet is leave enough infantry behind the Meuse to keep the supply
lines safe, and get all the armor and mechanized across up in the
Ardennes. If necessary, the Germans can swing back around and flank.</p>

<h4 id="german-recovery-phase-2">German Recovery Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Remove Disruption markers if possible (13.3).</p>

<p>No disrupted German units.</p>

      <li>units adjacent to enemy units</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All German units are in supply.</p>

<h4 id="gqg-phase-sickle-cut-only-2">GQG Phase (Sickle Cut only)</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">See Section 21.2</p>

<p>All 6 markers placed, numbers 6 and 4 removed by dice roll, both
of which are near Rommel. This is good for the French, these units
can fall back.</p>

<h3 id="allied-player-turn-2">Allied Player Turn 2</h3>

<p>The French need to fall back, they're not going to win a head-to-head
fight against the Germans in most cases. There may be selective battles
which are worth fighting if an important unit can be hurt, for example,
one of the panzer brigades.</p>

<p>In this turn, the French 9 Army HQ is in danger of being overrun by
1, 6 and 10 Pz, so it needs to find some place safe to go, fast.</p>

<h4 id="allied-initial-phase-2">Allied Initial Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Sickle Cut: Flip all non-Disrupted HQ from Used to Ready (17.2.1).</p>

<h4 id="allied-movement-phase-2">Allied Movement Phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Allied player may move all, some or none of the Allied units (7.0).
    <ul>
      <li>Rail movement at least 4, no more than 15 (7.7).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Turn 1 only) Dyle Line construction.</li>
  <li>Reinforcements enter (19.0).</li>
  <li>Note Extended Movement (7.3)</li>
</ul>

<p>Reinforcement, 3 units by random draw:</p>

<ol>
  <li>British 20G coming in on N.</li>
  <li>French 13 Inf coming in on SE.</li>
  <li>1 Col division coming on E.</li>
</ol>

<p>These aren't bad units at all.</p>

<p>Rail movement, three units currently on the rails, let's get these
out of the way first, and see if we can't go grab any of the
reinforcements. First thing is detraining 1 NA, 32 Inf and 43 Inf
exactly where they're currently located, and apply a Disrupted marker
which limits their movement to two hexes. The only other move that
makes sense is entraining the 13 Inf from its SE entry point to Laon.
The 13 Inf will likely detrain here next turn.</p>

<p>9 Army HQ flips to used to move 5 + 2 hexes. Can't use extended movement
on it's Ready side, and it's in too much danger where it is right now,
within 2 hexes of 3 panze divisions.</p>

<p>1 Army HQ flips and moves to the Dyle line. This may be a bad idea, but
the notion is to make it costly for the Germans to have at least some
sort of force in their rear area. It should be safe stacked up on the
fortification with 1 Morrocan.</p>

<p>A little reshuffling down south, but nothing much. The units I want
to entrain are both GQG.</p>

<h4 id="allied-combat-phase-2">Allied Combat Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Allied player conducts all attacks (8.0) including Overruns
(15.0) and Disengagement Attempts (20.4).</p>

<p>One combat here, a bunch of units on the Dyle line attacking 4 Pz at
2:1 odds. Quite likely there will be an attacker step loss, but just
as likely there will be a Defender Retreat, and possibly an exchange
or A1/D1, all which work fine for the Allies here. The Germans really
can't afford to be messing around, and if they get retreated that means
disrupted, which means 2 hex movement limit on the following turn. Any
roll but a 1 works… roll 4 for DR, 4 Pz is retreated and disrupted.
Bummer for the huns.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>The Germans have clearly broken through, and there is a gaping hole
in the French line. The northern end anchored by the Dyle line seems
much more secure for the French, as does the south which has the
advantage of both the Meuse and the Maginot Line to confound German
offensives. Whether that matters or not depends in part on what the
Germans do next. Do they make a dash for the channel? Or do they
shore up the rear area to ensure they stay in supply? We'll find out
more during Turn 3.</p>

<h3 id="german-player-turn-1">German Player Turn</h3>

<p>The German's main goal this turn is establish a definite salient deep
into France, while keeping enough pressure on the Maginot and Dyle lines
to make Allied abandonement of those positions costly. To this end, 3
and 4 Pz are swinging west and south across the Meuse; the Dyle line
is a sideshow, the armor and mechanized are needed to the west. This
puts them a little behind, but since the French Line cracked in Turn
2, they're still in pretty good shape. If nothing else, they can help
protect the flanks of the salient.</p>

<h4 id="german-initial-phase-3">German Initial Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Flip all Air units from Used to Ready side.</p>

  <li>Compute Automatic DS (10.1, 14.2)</li>
</ul>

<p>The infantry reinforcements move to help secure supply lines and the
flanks of the salient. Mechanized reinforcements such as 8 Pz move
straight west into the salient. As noted above, 3 and 4 Pz will join
other mechanized forces pushing west and leave the Dyle line to the
infantry. The French are in pretty tight to the southeast, and will
require flanking to dislodge them from around the Sedan area. 9 Pz is
one turn from Cambrai, 1 and 10 Pz one turn from Laon. The Germans
will engage in several places, and are expecting to be engaged by the
Allies this turn as well.</p>

<h4 id="german-combat-phase-3">German Combat Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German player conducts all attacks (8.0) including Overruns

<p>Three German attacks this turn. From northeast to southwest,
we have infantry divisions attacking empty fortification in
Namur, mechanized attack on depleted French in Foret de Trelon,
and mechanized action against 1 NA near Montcornet.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Namur: 12, 32, 28 Inf attacking Fort PFN, 18:3 is 6:1 with air 1R and
fortification hex 1L for net 7:1. Roll 3, DRM which eliminates PFN
and allow 28 and 32 Inf to advance into hex 5305.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5/2 and 25/2 Mech attacking depleted 61 Inf west of Foret de Trelon.
Attack 6 defend 3, 2:1 plus 1R air net 3:1, roll 2, EX, bummer but
the French would have attacked here next phase anyway with a pretty
good chance of losing more. On the good side, this French unit is
eliminated. However, DRM also gives a Bonus advance of 3 hexes to
motorized, and these are three actual hexes for which MP do not
have to be figured, so 5/2 and 25/2 move up next to the vanguard.
Step loss is taken from 25/2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 NA is being assaulted by elements of 1 and 10 Pz. The odds are 22:7
with TQ, armor and air shifts for 3R net. The problem here is
possibility of an adverse DRX result, so maybe better to stay at 4:1
odds by removing a unit…if possible. Need to check the rules on
stacking requirements with respect to combat…this is fine so
1/1 Pz Bgd is sitting this one out, while GD, 4/10 PzB (panzer
brigade, 86/10 and 69/10 mech will conduct the attack at 14:7
with 3R for 5:1 odds. If 86/10 wasn't depleted this would be
at 1:1 for 3:1 odds (no armor bonus). Roll 6 DS, 1 NA retreats
towards Laon with the 10 Pz in pursuit, but remains out of reach
of overrun.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Due to movement blunders favoring the Germans, the French lost
control of the Meuse and Ardennes very early in the game and now

<p>Reinforcements: 44 BEF mechanized from N moves to northwest of Arras;
21 Inf from N moves to fortified hex at Maulde; 44 Inf comes in from
SE moves to Riems. These are pretty good units, and in pretty good
positions. The Germans will have to mass to take on any of them.</p>

attacking the 5/2 and 25/2 motorized. The 25/2 is already 1 step
down. Odd are 2:1 with 1R HQ shift from 9 Army in Maubeuge. Roll 3,
DR, Well that wasn't that great, would have preferred an EX, or
even A1/D1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>German 8 Inf lodged in Bois du Prince is under attack from a
collection of French units. Low TQ from 35 and 38 Armor Batt. doesn't
matter here because they are combined with higher TQ units. Odds
are 26:8 yeilding 3:1 with 1R from 1 Army total 4:1. Roll 2, DR,
not bad, but again, would prefer to hurting German units even at
risk of losses. This is a good result for helping firm up a line and
possibly even pinch off the salient.</p>

<p>Big decisions now at the 1/3 point in the game. The Germans are
going to go for the coast, and attempt to cut the supply lines
running north to south. This is worth 10 VPs. The Allies are going to
try and prevent this. The situation over at the Dyle line will
remain a bit of sideshow. If I were playing an opponent, I'd be
looking to have the Germans cut supply off from Namur. In this game,
I may try that, but it won't be the main focus, and German units
may be shifted to supporting the reentrants of the salient instead.</p>

<p>The Allies plan for prevention involves fighting like hell to chew
down as many units as possible, while maintaining the N-S supply
across the map. This will require giving up a lot of ground, fast,
to get far enough ahead of the Germans to ruin their plans. We'll
see how it works out.</p>

<h3 id="german-player-turn-4">German Player Turn 4</h3>

<p>As noted above, the Germans will 1. go for the coast, while 2. keep
the pressure on the Dyle line and hope to get some kind of lucky in
the north.</p>

<p>Specifically, the armored and motorized infantry will be bolting west
at top speed, while the slower infantry divisions shore up the flanks
of the salient.</p>

<p>Out in front is 6 Pz, heading for a confrontation with BEF near Arras.
To the southwest is Rommel's 7 Pz, trailed closely by 5 Pz, both heading
for Abbeville. 10 Pz and 1 Pz are heading to Beauvais. 2 and 8 Pz are
following right up the middle. The infantry will engage in the Ardennes,
the south side of Namur, the north end of the Dyle line and southwest of
Sedan.</p>

<p>Here's the situation in the west:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/g1_t4_gm.jpg" alt="German Turn 4 move complete" /></p>

<p>As can be seen, the Germans have a thin line snaking out, which could be

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South side of Namur: 18:6 is 3:1 with 1L for fortification hex and 1R
  with Air Support, net 3:1 roll 1 (ouch) A1/DR. French will conduct
  Determined Defense: roll 5, in fort hex step loss both sides and
  retreat canceled. So that's two step losses for the Germans here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>French 3 NA is under attack from 4 German infantry divisions, odds
are 24:7 hence 3:1 with 1R for AS; roll 4 DR, will not engage wit
Determined Defense, will retreat across the Meuse.</p>

<p>And that's combat for the Germans in Turn 4. Could have been better, but
could have been worse.</p>

<p>The way the situation is developing, the Allies have some
opportunity to pinch off the salient and put the Germans
out of supply.</p>

<h4 id="allied-initial-phase-4">Allied Initial Phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Sickle Cut: Flip all non-Disrupted HQ from Used to Ready (17.2.1).</li>

  </li>
  <li>(Turn 1 only) Dyle Line construction.</li>
  <li>Reinforcements enter (19.0).</li>
  <li>Note Extended Movement (7.3)</li>
</ul>

<p>Reinforcements: British 5 Mech from N, French 14 Inf and 28 Mtn from SE
and S respectively. Very helpful, especially in the north as Lens can
probably be held, which would preserve the BEF HQ which is otherwise
in serious danger. de Gaulle! He goes to Reims. Hence, 5 Mech to Lens,
14 Inf to Compiègne (help protect entrained HQ), and the 44 entrains to
Charleville Mézieres region.</p>

<p>Rail: The Allies have a situation developing out west: units on trains which
will be unable to escape once detrained and Disrupted in their current
locations, so they have to move again by train. 6 Army is making a run
to the east, and will quite likely be able to detrain behind the German
line. 13 Inf moves to just north of Abbeville and will detrain in the
following turn. This will allow to get recovered and move back into
Abbeville by the time 10 Pz gets there. It's probably going down, but
hopefully it will take a piece of 10 Pz with it.</p>

<p>Southeast: The current plan is to continue to hold the Maginot line,
while shifting units west to maintain defense at the Meuse. So far the
Germans have not been able to cross the Meuse south of the Ardennes.</p>

<p>Northeast: Le French are Le Sad, but, they are working hard to close off
the salient, and they are going to force the Germans to stop advancing
and fight within another couple of turns.</p>

<p>I may bring in extra reinforcements for the French next turn, just for
fun so that the situation is a bit more balanced given the Germans broke
through the Ardennes so fast. This could be realistic, the Allies would
have shifted even more troops, right? Anyway, who cares, it's just a
game.</p>

<p>One battle for the Allies this turn:</p>

which are in the clear. It's 7:6 hence 1:1 with an armor shift
favoring the French for 2:1. Let's roll: 4 DR. Darn. Was hoping for at
least an EX. 2 Army HQ could have but did not participate, and will be
available for defensive use next turn.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's take a look at the situation at the end of Turn 4. Note that all
the Disrupted markers have been removed.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/g1_t4.jpg" alt="End of Turn 4" /></p>

<p>As can be seem, the French are slowly tightening the noose. The Germans
have a decision to make: stay and fight to push the French back and
protect supply, or get more mechanized units through the remaining gap
while it's still easy.</p>

<p>There's a lot to write. Let's start with the panzers:</p>

  <li>10 Pz and 1 Pz advance to just west of Amiens.</li>

  <li>2, 3, 4 and 8 Pz advance into the salient to keep the supply line

  <li>The infantry is grinding up into the salient to keep the supply lines
open. Going slow, but the French are on the other side of the Meuse,
so there isn't much danger.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what it looks like out in the west.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/g1_t5_gm.jpg" alt="German position in the west end of Turn 5" /></p>

<p class="turn-sequence">German player conducts all attacks (8.0) including Overruns

<p>Four battles instigated by the Germans this turn.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dyke line: French 12 Inf (depleted) and BEF 20G defending against 7,
18, 35 and 269 Inf. Odds are 24:8 with 1L for fortification 1L for 7
Army HQ and 1R for German Air Support, net 2:1 roll 6 for D1. That's
step loss and retreat, but the Allies are going to conduct
Determined Defense since they're fortified. The Determined Defense
roll is a 5, which is a 1/1 and the Dyle line holds! The French have
been good about holding solid ground when they're on it.</li>
  <li>The battle continues on the south side of Namur, with 2:1 odds, roll
1 A1, dang. The Jerrys are getting whupped.</li>
  <li>At the west tip of the Ardennes, two panzer divisions engage 18 Inf.
This is a strong unit, it's 33:7 which is 4:1 with 1R and 1L. Roll 3
for DR, but 18 Inf is surrounded by EZOCs. Time to go to the rules.
According to the rules, the 14 can retreat to an overstack situation
right through the EZOC, so that's what it does. In any case, this
punches a nice hole through the Allied line for at least another
turn.</li>
  <li>Trying for the Meuse southwest of Sedan. 4 German infantry divisions
at half strength each for 12 attack factors. One poor quality French
infantry unit (55 Inf) defending at double strength for 12. Air and
TQ shift for 2R, with French 2 Army shift 1L for 2:1. Let's see what
happens. Roll 1, A1, dang.</li>
</ol>

<p>There was some notion about attempting Cambria, but that would be a
tough nut with only one panzer division and two motorized. Maybe tomorrow.</p>

on the trains, which is now working for the Allies.</p>

<p>Other movement includes some motion around the north end of the Maginot

<p>Continuing at the western edge of the Ardennes, we have three battles
to keep the German supply lines open. There is a possibility, albeit

<p>GQG turned out ok for the Allies. The big armor stack went back under

all the GQG this turn, and will emplace next turn as usual.</p>

<h3 id="allied-player-turn-6">Allied Player Turn 6</h3>

<p>Dark days for the Allies, as it was in history. Fortunately, some extra
reinforcements (!) just happened to have appeared…a little late, but
definitely welcome.</p>

<p>So, what to do? A few (2) extra reinforcements is nice, but it's not
nearly enough to salvage the situation for the Allies. What I'm looking
for as a player is to limit the damage. For example, let's assume the
Germans pretty much have it in the bag as far as the game goes. What's
the most sensible thing to concede to the Germans, versus the most
sensible thing to fight over?</p>

<p>Task 1: Hold the E and SE at all costs, from Riems west. If possible,
extend this through Soissons in subsequent turns.</p>

<p>Task 2: Attempt to trap the units which broke through the Dyle Line into
an out of supply situation by holding an arc between Namur and Tournai.
This will grant the Germans the possibility of 3 N exit hexes, but
unless those hexes are in supply, they won't matter.</p>

<p>Task 3: Watch for opportunity to establish N-S supply at the coast,
which is going to the Germans real soon now.</p>

  <li>SE: 11, 27 (Mtn) and 36 Inf. Not great but not bad.</li>

<p>The Germans are just about cut off out west. The Allies just shattered a

<p>The situation hasn't changed too much over the last couple of turns: the

<p>In the east, many battles to beat back the Allies. The infantry
reinforcements primarily used for this. The main fighting is on the
western tip of the Ardennes, where there is a small gap through the
Allied EZOCs which is really slowing down the German advance. This needs
to be blown open because the mechanized units are bottlenecked behind
it.</p>

<p>In the west, the situation is considerably more complicated, and I don't
really know what the Germans need to do. A good plan would be to shift
units west, protecting current gains, and attempt to cut the north-south
rail line between X and Abbeville.</p>

<h4 id="german-combat-phase-7">German Combat Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German player conducts all attacks (8.0) including Overruns

<p>Six combats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>26 and 72 Inf take on the Maginot. It's 12:5, with an air shift 1R, an
HQ shift 1L, and the Maginot shift 1L for 1:1. That was a
miscalculation, but let's roll… 6 for A1/D1, lucky! This is an
elmination of the fort, and the Germans advance into that hex. This
threatens the E entry point of the Allies. This is probably not going
to hold, as the Allied can mass against it. Would have been better to
have left a few more German infantry units in that area to dissuade
Allied counterattacks. Or punish them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Ardennes, a 2:1 rolls 5 for A1/D1, Germans decline the advance,
prefer staying in wooded terrain for better Determined Defense if
necessary on counterattack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Forêt de Siguy le-Petit, 4:1 roll 5 D1, French retreat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bois de Chimay, 7 defending, 26 attacking 1R Air Support for 4:1 roll
5 D1, the reserve units move up, but decline to break through as they
are not strong in defense.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>North side of Forêt de Trelon, 4:1 roll 4 A1/D1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Charleroi, no Air on this one, straight slugfest. 7 Army and 2 NA
defending in city so DF is 14. Attacking we have 28, so 1:1
considering shift 1L from HQ, roll 1 for A1, bummer. Step loss from 18
Inf. Will need an air or quality shift to make this worthwhile.</p>

<p>Main goal for this turn is to get really aggressive with cutting off

map. This will force the German player to pursue the Allies out of
necessity. At this point, the Allies will be getting enough
reinforcements that they can afford to lose more units.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>S: 23 Inf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>E: 3 Inf, which will immediately attack on the Maginot to reclaim lost
ground and prevent taking the Allied reinforcement zones. Good chance
this will occur as it's coming in a 3:1.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Detraining de Gaulle, 2 DRC and 7 NA. Will need these units bad in the
last two turns. Entraining 6 Army and moving east, will be available on
Turn 10.</p>

<p>The rest of the Allied units ar going to close the noose on the Germans
on a line running from the southeast to the northwest, from the Maginot
Line to Armentières. Reinforcements from the south can travel due north.
The supply line to the far west is going to be tough to hold, we'll see
what happens.</p>

<p>But the line is in and the Germans will be out of supply if they cannot
break this line next turn. This is going to be tough for them as they
need to start exiting units from the map.</p>

hurts 8 Pz more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3:1 on SS Tot in Courcelles, roll 2 for EX, not the best roll for the
French in this case. Anything with a retreat would have better.
Actually, this is a 4:1 as there is an armor shift, which means roll 2
is a DR, which is much better!</p>

Recap the preceding turn, describe challenge for each player in upcoming

<p>Getting down to the wire, and the Germans are technically out of supply
from Allied activity yesterday. Their goal today is to open the supply
lines back up and ensure they stay open. Along the way, cut the far west
Allied rail for 10 VP, and exit a number of mechanized units off the
map.</p>

<p>And fight like hell to get the supply lines back open before the supply
phase at the end of the turn.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that if there were a couple more turns, there is a
good chance the Germans could pocket a dozen Allied units just west of
Namur. Not sure there will be time for that. And it's a bit of a
distraction in any case.</p>

<p>The Allies need to 1. keep from getting encircled, while 2. keeping the
pressure on German supply, and 3. attempting to keep supply open across
the north-south corridor.</p>

<h3 id="german-player-turn-3">German Player Turn</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Describe the main challenge to the German player this turn, and one or

<p>First, supply is critical, and it has to be opened back up whatever the
cost to German units.</p>

<p>The effort in the west is going to be somewhat secondary, although VPs
can be picked up here fairly easily by units that cannot get back to the
main fighting west of the Ardennes.</p>

<p>Big battles this turn, seven of them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Between Namur and Châtelet, 8 German units attacking French 5 Mot,
which is completely surrounded, 43:7 no shifts yields 6:1, roll DRM
but there's no place to go. This is an elminination as there is no
Determined Defense allowed for DRM, hence no Desperation Defense.
Verf SS advances into the vacated hex.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South of Courcelles: German infantry divisions taking on a stack of 5
French armor battalions. Raw odds 10:5, shift 2R TQ and Air, 1L armor
shift defending, yield 3:1 roll 2 for EX, probably as good an outcome
for the French as could be expected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avesnes-sur-Helpes: 28:12, TQ and Air shift 2R, armor shifts cancel,
yield 4:1 roll 5 for D1, having to do some major advancing after
combat here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>West of Fourmeis: Load of German motorized taking on 3 DCR which is
under a GQG (6). 18:6 with Air and TQ shift 2R and armor shift 1L
yield 4:1 roll 2 for DR, could have gone better for Germans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South of Fourmeis: 16 Inf takes on 3 Mot at 1:1 with shift 1R for Air
yield 2:1 roll 6 (lucky!) for D1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Southeast of Valenciennes: French 9 Mot (depleted) defending in fort
hex against 90/20 Mot and 2/2 Pz Bg, 2k/2 Mot and 3/3 Pz Bg. This is
21:5 with Air shift canceling fort hex shift, yield 4:1 roll 4 for
A1/D1. French 9 Inf goes to Remnant, will employ Determined Defense
using "Other" column with -1 modified, roll 3 - 1 is 2. No Effect.
So the 9 Inf is pretty much done. I think there is an opportunity here
for overruning during retreat, but I don't really understand the
overrun rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>North of Hesdin, over by the Channel 4/10 and 11/6 Pz taking on
British 44 Mot. 16:8 with armor and TQ for 2R yields 4:1 roll 5 for
D1, which is great for the Germans as they can advance on other
British units 25 Mot and 46 Inf, which locks them up pretty good.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, not as good of results as the Germans need, but there is supply
across the map as of right now. The Allies are sure to shut it down
again, they have a lot of units in motion and closing fast.</p>

<p>The Allies are probably going to close the front between Valenciennes

between Valenciennes and Mons they'll be in a great position to <em>really</em>

  <li>29 Mtn from S, and</li>
  <li>British 12 Inf from W.</li>
</ul>

<p>Time to move some units. The situation isn't playing out like I thought.
The Allies line is collapsing west of Namur, too much German infantry to
hold it. However, they may be able to encircle more Germans after all,
and they do take there supply line to friendly cities, so withdrawing
westward should work.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Describe the main challenge to the Allied player this turn, and one or

<p>This is a make or break turn for the Allies. So far it has felt like the
Allies have been losing the whole game, but here at the end, there seems
like an opportunity to shut the Germans down completely by closing off
supply to the eastern edge of the board. Along with closing supply, it
may be possible to encircle a number of mechanized units to gain more
VPs. Let's play it out.</p>

<h4 id="allied-initial-phase-9">Allied Initial Phase</h4>

<p>Too tired to go blow by blow. Succinctly, the Allies move loads of units
to cut off the German advance and close the supply lines to the east.
This (if I understand it correctly) puts all the German units in the
west out of supply and negates victory points for all units exiting
anywhere but X.</p>

</ul>

<p>Couple of Allied units out of supply north side of Ardennes.</p>

<h3 id="end-game">End Game</h3>

<p>Here's what it looks like at the end of the game.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/g1_end.jpg" alt="Situation at end of game" /></p>

<p>Score: Germans 4, all the other exit points are out of supply.
Allies, at least 4 units destroyed, N-S rails for 10
coming in from Armintières and exiting via Abbeville, 11
mechanized units out of supply. Roughly, 25 to Allies if I'm counting
this correctly.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Due to numerous blunders as listed below, the Germans got across
the Meuse on Turn 2. This is pretty much not possible using legal
moves, there's no way to get the Ardennes that fast. The terrain
there is why the area was so lightly defended. Using legal moves,
if the Germans try to smash through the Ardennes, the Allies will
have enough time to move a few units there to stiffen it up.</p>

<p>As a result of that, and getting to the Channel by Turn 6 or so, I
handicapped in the Allies favor the GQG for a couple of turns, and
allowed a couple of extra reinforcements in for turns 6, 7 and 8.
This turned out to be a lot. Too much. By the end of the game, the
Germans are stretched so thin, the Allies should be well able to handle
the situation.</p>

<p>Another thing the Germans did which was dumb is going after too many
exit points. For example, GD and 1 Pz (div) exited South, and they were
clearly needed to keep the supply lines open up north. This goes to show
it's good to make a plan and stick with it.</p>

<p>It was however, a pretty close thing. Had the Germans stayed in supply,
it would have been 14 to 8. The Allies just <em>barely</em> have rail, too.
Had they not retaken Arras, it looks like all the rail would have been
cut. This would have made the score 18 (10 for cutting rail, 8 for
exiting units) to 9 (4 units, 5 for overland supply trace).</p>

<p>The next game I play of this will be a shorter game which handles only
the breakthrough across the Meuse. The idea is to see how long the
French can hold out before the Germans get a solid crossing. At least
three turns I would hope, five turns would be even better. It will be
much more difficult for the Germans using the correct, legal movement
rates through woods, especially Ardennes and rough terrain.</p>

<h3 id="improving-the-allies-strategy">Improving the Allies strategy</h3>

<p>Explore voluntary retreat to allow fast movement to better defensive
positions.</p>

<p>Figure out how to use the Allied motorized. These have a lot of
strength, and while forting them up can help hold a line, it seems like
these units would be better used pestering the Germans in some way.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<p>Quite a number, but not surprising given this is a first game.</p>

<h4 id="german">German</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Quartered the total attack factors for the Germans attacking northwest
of Sedan to across the Muese in Turn 1. This should have been halved
for the Germans only once, and the defender doubled only once. This
may or may not have affected the odds, but if it did, it almost
certainly was a negative effect on the German odds. As per rules, no
attack factor can be halved more than once, no defense factor doubled
more than once.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forgot to use Extended Movement (7.3) for German movement phase in Turn 1.
This may not have matter overmuch as most of the German movement was to
initiate combat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forgot to charge +2 MP to leave EZOC, which probably put me through
the Ardennes ahead of time, except that with better play I would not
have fiddled around in the EZOCs around Sedan anyway. So it's probably
a wash with respect to good game play. Still, need be aware of this
going forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Woods movement costs 2 for mechanized, but the movement cost is not
assessed for certain movements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Divisional stacking can exceed 7 points. For example, two panzer
divsions can be stacked together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wooded rough terrain. Stop on entering, mechanized <strong>prohibited</strong> unless
along road. I keep doing this, even as far along a Turn 4. I'll know
better for the next game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 Step units leave Remnant counters after their second step loss. I
forgot about this for 2 French units, so I put a couple of remnants
on the map in Charleroi lacking anything better to do with them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maginot Line cuts German attack strength in half, which I didn't
realize. It didn't matter for this game as those German units were too
isolated to be effective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Huge blunder: not exiting loads of mechanized through the X points.
These only need to be in supply when they exit, not at the end of the
game.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Probably the biggest blunder was not getting across the Meuse in the
South. This allowed the French to tighten up that line enough to divert
incoming reinforcements to the Ardennes.</p>

<h4 id="frenchallies">French/Allies</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>French garrison units in Sickle Cut have their movement in a block box
and may not move until Germans are within 2 hexes. I think I violated
this rule at least once. However, these are pretty weak units so I
don't think it mattered all that much for game play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keeping too many high quality units too far back. In some ways this is
an artifact of having these units under GQG most of the game.
Specifically, the first time 2 and 3 DLM came out from under GQG, they
didn't do anything, just hung around just west of Namur. They should
have at least advanced into a position to cause the Germans some
trouble, if not attacking 3 Pz outright. When I figured this out, I
was tempted to "mulligan" them forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stacking powerful units together ensure the Germans will target
exactly those stacks for GQG. Hence, don't stack overly strong units
together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allied units need 3 friendly controlled city hexes for line of supply
tracing, not one as I was playing. This would have had an effect in
around Namur against the Allies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>de Gaulle does NOT get a re-roll, that's only for Rommel and Monty.
This blunder probably wouldn't have changed the outcome materially.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="handicapping">Handicapping</h3>

<p>Two ways to handicap in the Allies favor are moving the reinforcement
schedule "forward" and allow the Allie to bring in one, two or even more
extra reinforcements on each turn. Or, keeping the same number of
reinforcements, but allow the Allied player to draw, say, one or two
extra, choose the most useful for that turn, and throw the remaining
back into the reinforcement pool. Another way might be to allow the two
Allied air units to play.</p>

<p>From this first play, the Germans don't seem to need any handicapping.</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-winning-from-bgg">Notes on winning from BGG</h3>

<p>From <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/article/15439226#15439226">BGG</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have played Sickle Cut repeatedly, and trust me it does not feel like less
than the full campaign. There are things going on off in the north, and the war
continues after the time limit - but the actual campaign in France was all
decided right here, right now, in this sector.

<p>The map runs from Namur in the north to first two hexes of the Maginot line
in the south, so pretty much only Holland and the far north of the Belgium
sector are out of play, along with the completely static Maginot sector in the
south.

<p>There is a fight just north of Namur for the Dyle line, of the Germans can
choose to shift the 2 Panzer divisions that start there to south of Namur.

<p>There is the fight in the north center where Rommel made his crossing.

<p>There is Guderian's main effort in the south.

<p>Whether and when these sectors merge and interact with one another is the
key operational question.

<p>The Germans have multiple ways to win. They need 10 VPs from exit hexes
blocked off if the Allies hold a north to south rail line at the end, plus 1
for each full German unit lost. They can get that many with a southern wing
victory that crosses just half the map - a "drive on Paris". They can pick up 3
VPs in the north if they drive past Namur, through the Dyle line, pretty close
behind that line, and that means in the south they don't need to get as far
west to win.

<p>Or they can go for the whole enchilada and try to cut the north south
railways at the channel coast. If they succeed in that they are almost certain
to win.

<p>Last, they can exit in supply units off the northwest edge toward Dunkirk,
without needing to hold the whole north to south "cut" to the time limit. They
get 1 VP per unit so exited, and the supply line is only checked when they exit
- so even if the line closes up behind them, enough run off the board there
will win. With a few entry hexes in the south, exiting 3 mobile divisions that
way will also win.

<p>The Germans can try for any subset of those - the Allies need to stop all of
them.

<p>The German face a very tough "clock" - only 10 turns.

<p>In my experience, if the Germans know what they are doing and coordinate
their attacks well, if can take 3-4 turns to get going but then they will break
the French line, somewhere, beyond immediate repair. They typically get the
breakthrough about half way through, or a little after.

<p>But that alone isn't enough to win - they have to "cash it" in one of those
definite ways. Getting close to two of those ways won't cut it.

<p>The French have a real ability to hit back, and must turns on how actively
they use it. If they just backpeddle and patch a line together, they will be a
punching bag and break apart. They need to run risks to get their own licks in.

<p>What is driving that is that the CRT is very favorable to attackers, when
all the opportunities to gather shifts are included. The Germans get quality
and air just about everywhere, every turn. They get armor rarely - terrain and
French armor mostly neutralize that possible shift - but occasionally. 2
quality vs remnants also occasionally.

<p>The French can get auto armor shifts in the open from their heavy tank DRC
divisions, and HQ artillery shifts. Sometimes they face a QL shift against
them, if they are hitting German panzer formations. Against infantry and
motorized they can readily get the armor shift even without having a DCR
division around.

<p>This means 4-1 odds are easily in reach bringing only equal number of
factors in 2 hexes to hit 1. And odds that high almost always force a defender
retreat (or determined defense to neutralize it, at a risk of extra losses and
50-50 success etc). The big thing is any stack "pushed" with a retreat result
is disrupted on its next turn - meaning it only moves 2 hexes and can't move
next to enemies or attack. So a panzer divison forced back even a short
distance is out of the fight for 10% of the clock. Believe me, that matters.

<p>Overall, the scenario definitely favors the Germans, in my opinion. But it
isn't the same way every time. There is too much early variation from success
or failure crossing the strong Meuse position (Guderian will get across,
everywhere else it is dicey and can take 2-3 turns), from where the French put
their initially strong forces to make it hard for the Germans to attack, from
different German decisions about what to shoot for, etc.

<p>If the Germans always just go for the channel coast, then the Allies have a
solid chance of stopping them just because it is a long way to get in a short
period of time, and that far from the start line a lot of the German (infantry)
army won't help very much. But they don't have to make that choice - they have
options, and each plays out its own way.

<p>FWIW...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
