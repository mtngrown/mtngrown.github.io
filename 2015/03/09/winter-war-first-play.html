Winter War First Play
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar  9 2015</time>
<p>At this point I have 3 different games set up and running concurrently. Probably not
that smart, but my attention span is really short at the moment, and I don't feel like
tearing in too deeply into the details of any one game. OCS Kasserine (from Tunisia) is
definitely going to wait until I after next weekend's OCS game with several other newbies.
France '40 I want to steep in over the next month as well, because at some point I'm
going to be playing CC. It's his only wargame, so I suspect he's going to go pretty deep
into it.</p>

<p>For this game, I may just set it up, play a turn or two, then tear it back down. We'll see.
Fortunately, it's in a picture frame, so it will be easy to set it back up any time.</p>

<p>(<em>Update May 14, 2015: I had to put this away for a few weeks. Having
several new games underway at the same time doesn't work for me. I'm
good with having one learning game and one game I already know the rules
for underway at the same time, but not two or more learning games at the
same time.</em>)</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for both players.</p>

<p>Given this is the first play, and lacking any other notion of what to
do, the Soviets will pound on the Mannerheim, and probe everywhere else
on the map. If possible, the two armor units will attempt a grab at
Oulu, given the Ladoga Line falls. The Finns, for this first game, are
going to simply do what's necessary to deny the Soviets.</p>

<p>Here's the setup:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/winter-war/g1-start.jpg" alt="Winter War set up for Game 1" /></p>

<p>I didn't bother with the dummy counters, too inconvenient for this first solo
game.</p>

<h3 id="soviet-turn-1">Soviet Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for the Soviet player.</p>

<p>Since this is a first game, I'm just going to bang on the Mannerheim and

<h4 id="reinforcement-phase-2">Reinforcement Phase</h4>

<p>All Soviet units in supply this turn.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/winter-war/g1-t1-russian-attack.jpg" alt="Russians to attack" /></p>

<p>Here's a close up of the situation facing the Russians on Turn 1.
Note the Russian units were placed before I fully understand how
adjacency induces mandatory combat for Russian units, and before I
understood stacking restrictions.</p>

<p>At the Mannerheim, one battle at 1:1, roll 1 yields <code>Ae</code>, not an
auspicious start for the Russians.</p>

<p>At the Ladoga Line, the Russians have to have combat with 4 Finnish
divisions, the 4, 12, 21 and 13. From north to south:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Russian 56 and 75 take on the Finnish 12, 11: roll 3 yields <code>NE</code>,
which is really a reprieve for the Russians in this case.</li>
  <li>Russian 18 and 92 against the Finnish 4, 1:1 odds roll 3 yields <code>NE</code>,
another reprieve for the Russians, almost like a restart.</li>
  <li>The Russian 11th is going to take on the Finnish 21 and 13 according
to the combined defense rule (Combat CASE K). This will be low odds
for the Russian, 1:4 automatically eliminated.</li>
</ol>

<p>Result: 1 Russian division and 1 Russian army elminated, no losses for
the Finns.</p>

<h3 id="finnish-turn-1">Finnish Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for the Finnish player.</p>

<p>The Finns are happy, for now, to sit in their defensive positions and
let the Russians come to them.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-phase-3">Reinforcement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Acquire reinforcements from the schedule on the map. All reinforcements

<p>No reinforcements first turn.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Check supply status for each unit attacking and defending (Supply CASEs B, C, D).</p>

<h3 id="scenario-interphase-optional-1">Scenario Interphase (Optional)</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">See rules.</p>

<p>Playing basic scenario this game.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-1">End of Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the turn marker along the turn track, Soviet player become
phasing player.</p>

<p>The Soviets need to change tactics, or they risk just getting chewed up
the whole game with nothing to show for it.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for both players.</p>

<p>Prognosticating, the Soviets will attempt to breach the Mannerheim and
Ladoga Lines, the Finns will sit tight and hold those lines as best they
can.</p>

<h3 id="soviet-turn-2">Soviet Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for the Soviet player.</p>

<p>Being a first game, it's worth just pounding away at the Finnish lines
to see what it takes to break them. I don't think there is any other way
to get into Finland in any case.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-phase-4">Reinforcement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Acquire reinforcements from the schedule on the map. All reinforcements
must be place in-supply.</p>

<p>No Soviet reinforcements Turn 2.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase-4">Movement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Soviet player moves unit subject to movement factors, terrain, Zone of
Control and Supply Status.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Check for supply status for each unit moving.</p>

<p>Keep moving up to the lines to pound away. Which means moving only a
stack of 20-12-2 into the Mannerheim, everything stays put for now.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-4">Combat Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Combat has the following three segments:</p>

<h5 id="retreat-before-combat-segment-4">Retreat-Before-Combat Segment</h5>

<p class="turn-sequence">Non-phasing player may retreat certain units; retreated units do not
contribute any defense strength to the hex they have retreated into
(Combat CASE A). Only 0-0-3 and 1-1-3 may retreat before combat, subject
to location on map. Soviet HQ may retreat before combat in any location.
See other limitations in rules.</p>

<p>No retreats.</p>

<h5 id="advance-before-combat-segment-4">Advance-Before-Combat Segment</h5>

<p class="turn-sequence">Any one unit previously adjacent to a retreated-before-combat unit may
advance one hex (Combat CASE B).</p>

<p>No advances.</p>

<h5 id="attack-segment-4">Attack Segment</h5>

<p class="turn-sequence">Soviet player is obligated to attack all Finnish units to which he has a
unit adjacent, unless 1. unit is isolated, unit advanced before combat
or is a HQ unit (Combat CASE E).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Check supply status for each unit attacking and defending (Supply CASEs B, C, D).</p>

<p>Four 1-1 attacks, two on Ladoga, two on Mannerheim:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ladoga 1, roll 1, <code>Ae</code>.</li>
  <li>Ladoga 2, roll 6, <code>Dr(NE)</code>.</li>
  <li>Mannerheim 1, roll 5, <code>Dr(NE)</code>.</li>
  <li>Mannerheim 2, roll 4 <code>Ex</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>1-1 odds are really bad for Soviets against the Lines, being only 1/6
chance of any effect at all, which is to roll a 4 for <code>Ex</code>.</p>

<p>This is an odd game. I don't see that the Finns need to do anything yet.</p>

<h3 id="finnish-turn-2">Finnish Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for the Finnish player.</p>

<p>Hold the line!</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-phase-5">Reinforcement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Acquire reinforcements from the schedule on the map. All reinforcements
must be placed in-supply.</p>

<p>Finns get a load of reinforcements on Turn 2. The heavy units move to
the Mannerheim Line, some ski units to Petsamo, light infantry reserves
in Helsinki and Oulu, will rail to where needed.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase-5">Movement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Finnish player moves unit subject to movement factors, terrain, Zone of
Control and Supply Status.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Check for supply status for each unit moving.</p>

<p>Everything is in supply.</p>

<p>Because ZOCs from Soviet forces do not extend into Fortification hexes
occupied (or last occupied) by Finnish units (Zones of Control, CASE G),
the Finns are going to force some really bad combat on the Soviet
2012-12-2 unit on the Mannerheim Line, by moving the 6-6-2 to reduce
attacker odds. This puts the odds such that the Soviets <em>cannot</em> inflict
losses on the Finns on the Mannerheim Line next turn.</p>

<p>If the Soviets ever break through here, it could go really bad for the
Finns.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-5">Combat Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Combat has the following three segments:</p>

<h5 id="retreat-before-combat-segment-5">Retreat-Before-Combat Segment</h5>

<p class="turn-sequence">Non-phasing player may retreat certain units; retreated units do not
contribute any defense strength to the hex they have retreated into
(Combat CASE A). Only 0-0-3 and 1-1-3 may retreat before combat, subject

See other limitations in rules.</p>

<p>No retreats.</p>

<h5 id="advance-before-combat-segment-5">Advance-Before-Combat Segment</h5>

<p class="turn-sequence">Any one unit previously adjacent to a retreated-before-combat unit may
advance one hex (Combat CASE B).</p>

<p>No advances.</p>

<h5 id="attack-segment-5">Attack Segment</h5>

<p class="turn-sequence">Finnish player is not obligated to attack any Soviet units (Combat CASE
D).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Check supply status for each unit attacking and defending (Supply CASEs B, C, D).</p>

<p>Finns choose not to attack this turn.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-interphase-optional-2">Scenario Interphase (Optional)</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">See rules.</p>

<p>No interphase this game.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-2">End of Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the turn marker along the turn track, Soviet player become
phasing player.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for both players.</p>

<p>So far, the Soviet decision to pound on Finnish defensive lines is
looking rather ill-advised. Losses are running 4:1 in favor of the
Finns, but the Soviets are losing whole armies to Finnish divisions. Not
good for the Soviets.</p>

<h3 id="soviet-turn-3">Soviet Turn 3</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for the Soviet player.</p>

<p>This turn, the Soviets are going to rethink what they're doing.
They are lucky the Finns didn't just go grab Murmansk, because it's
undefended right now. It requires a mandatory defense starting very
shortly, which will go in on this turn in any case. Then probably an
advance on Petsamo, just to feel good about something.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-phase-6">Reinforcement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Acquire reinforcements from the schedule on the map. All reinforcements
must be placed in-supply.</p>

<p>Reinforcements are in, with 7 units earmarked for Petsamo, and the 3rd Army
occupying Leningrad, which, as it turns out, would have otherwise been
dangerously exposed.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase-6">Movement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Soviet player moves unit subject to movement factors, terrain, Zone of
Control and Supply Status.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Check for supply status for each unit moving.</p>

<p>Mostly rail to Petsamo to ensure the Finns don't trespass and capture
it unopposed. That would just be stupid. Since the rail movement costs
nothing, a couple of infantry regiments start the slog across river and
swamp to flank Petsamo in the north. The Finns don't have much strength
up there.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-6">Combat Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Combat has the following three segments:</p>

<h5 id="retreat-before-combat-segment-6">Retreat-Before-Combat Segment</h5>

<p class="turn-sequence">Non-phasing player may retreat certain units; retreated units do not
contribute any defense strength to the hex they have retreated into
(Combat CASE A). Only 0-0-3 and 1-1-3 may retreat before combat, subject
to location on map. Soviet HQ may retreat before combat in any location.
See other limitations in rules.</p>

<p>Nothing to retreat.</p>

<h5 id="advance-before-combat-segment-6">Advance-Before-Combat Segment</h5>

<p class="turn-sequence">Any one unit previously adjacent to a retreated-before-combat unit may
advance one hex (Combat CASE B).</p>

<p>No advances.</p>

<h5 id="attack-segment-6">Attack Segment</h5>

<p class="turn-sequence">Soviet player is obligated to attack all Finnish units to which he has a
unit adjacent, unless 1. unit is isolated, unit advanced before combat
or is a HQ unit (Combat CASE E).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Check supply status for each unit attacking and
defending (Supply CASEs B, C, D).</p>

<p>Once again, a mandatory attack, on the Ladoga Line, roll 1, <code>Ae</code>. That's
not good, two Russian divisions destroyed. At the south end, roll 3,
<code>Ne</code>. Ok, the lines cannot be breached. What else can be done?</p>

<h3 id="finnish-turn-3">Finnish Turn 3</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for the Finnish player.</p>

<p>So far, the Finns don't really need to do anything at all, just keep the
Mannerheim Line provisioned and the let the 1/6 chance of an exchange
reduce the Finnish forces.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-phase-7">Reinforcement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Acquire reinforcements from the schedule on the map. Finnish
reinforcements are placed in Finnish cities which are under Finnish
control (vice Russian control). See game map for details.</p>

<p>Reinforcements to Petsamo. The Soviets are going to have a very hard

them down.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase-7">Movement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Finnish player moves unit subject to movement factors, terrain, Zone of

<p class="turn-sequence">Check for supply status for each unit moving.</p>

<h3 id="soviet-turn-4">Soviet Turn 4</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for the Soviet player.</p>

<p>The Soviets have now lost too many front line units to breach either
defensive line, almost surely. The best they will be able to do is slug
it out for Petsamo, and ensure the Finns don't get into the Soviet rear
areas. This means putting garrisons along the rail line, as the Finns
can reinforce within striking distance from the border.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-phase-8">Reinforcement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Acquire reinforcements from the schedule on the map. All reinforcements

lose both. (<em>Finnish blunder: 1-1-3 units should have retreated before

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finnish-turn-4">Finnish Turn 4</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for the Finnish player.</p>

<p>The Finns now need to make some harder choices, as the Soviets are just
driving around the north end of the Ladoga Line. They won't really get
anywhere for victory points, but they may be able to put some pressure
on the back off of the Mannerheim near the end of the game. Hence, it
bears a bit of scrutiny from the Finns to evaluate the best course of

accomplish anything.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the situation for both players.</p>

<p>This game is starting to annoy me. I want to just finish it out, but I'm
not even half doe with it yet, and I'm not convinced the Soviets have
any chance at all of winning, or even achieving a draw. Writing up these
situation summaries at the beginning of each turn isn't helping my mood
either. The actual game play seems to be taking much less time than the
writing.</p>

<p>However, I'm convinced that plowing through these summaries and making
the effort to write everything out as I've been doing pays back with
much deeper understanding of both the rules and the tactical situation.
Expending this effort now makes all future games much more enjoyable.</p>

<p>And that's pretty much the end of that for the Soviets. Some pretty

<p>I think the Soviets have a chance at cracking the ML. Next game, don't

  <li>Petsamo from the south, 2:1 roll 4 yields <code>Dr</code> which require the Petsamo defenders
to retreat either into Norway, or through a ZOC. According to rules,
however, defending strength is double in cities, so this is 1:1 for
an <code>Ex</code> result, which probably serves the Soviets better, except they
just lost several more units which reduced the score even more.</li>

<p>These <code>Ex</code> results worked as the Finns didn't have smaller hence, the
big 20-12-2 units weren't eliminated, only the 6-4-2 units.</p>

<p>I'm calling the game here, as there is no way for the Soviets to advance
into Finland to acquire the +25 VPs at Viipuri, they need two turns.
The Soviets would probably hold Petsamo, but are again penalized -10 for
lack of units at Murmansk at the end of this turn. We'll call it a
Finnish victory at -5.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/winter-war/g1-end.jpg" alt="End of Turn 9, Soviet Phase, game conceded to

<p>The situation at Petrozadovsk is interesting, but I never really figured
out what to do with it. From this first play, the whole Ladoga Line
feels like a bit of sideshow.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>It probably would have behooved the Soviets to deploy some forces to
threaten Oulu. These likely would be out of the rest of the game, but
such forces would tie up the Finns in the middle of nowhere, reducing
their effectiveness in Petsame and on the Lines.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The biggest blunder I think was in game play rather than rules
misinterpretation. Namely, the Soviets should have waited to attack
the Mannerheim line until they had enough reinforcement armies to
allow <em>at least</em> one 2:1 attack on the Line. 1:1 attacks are just too
risky. The Finns still have one more 6-6-2 they can move into the
breach as there is no advance after combat, but even one more lucky
2:1 gets the Soviets into the Mannerheim. Waiting until Turn 4 would
get 5 20-12-2 up to the Mannerheim, which would allow at least one and
possibly 2 2:1 odds attacks, each of which has 50% chance of success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forgetting to retreat before combat at the first and sensible
opportunity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not moving Soviet HQ units around to ensure supply. For the first 4
turns, I just used trace supply.</p>

    <p>Defending strength is doubled in home cities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are probably more, but this is fairly small game, with a short
rule book, so I'm feeling pretty good about understanding the rules.</p>

<h2 id="errata">Errata</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/251756/winter-war-official-spi-errata">BGG</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>S&amp;T #33 Winter War (Errata as of 31 May 73, from Moves #9)
<p>------------------

<p>VICTORY CONDITIONS

<p>Note: If the Finns occupy Leningrad they score an
immediate automatic victory as Finnish occupation of
Leningrad isolates all Soviet units and prevents the
introduction of any Soviet reinforcements

<p>REINFORCEMENT CHART

<p>Under Finnish Game-Turn #8, the Finnish quota for 2-2-3
cavalry brigades should be one (1) instead of two (2).

<p>On Finnish Game-Turn #8 there should be included a 2-2-3
regiment.

<p>COUNTER-MIX DISCREPANCIES

<p>There is one extra Finnish 1-1-3 infantry Battalion that
is not to be used in the game.

<p>There is one extra Russian 20-12-2 infantry Corps that is
not to be used in the game.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
