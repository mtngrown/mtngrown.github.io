Back to Vietnam with White Dog's solitaire game
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 19 2015</time>
<p>(<em>Note: I made a major blunder in setting up this game, as in, I didn't
set it up. There are supposed to be VC and NVA already on the map, and
Trail counters in Hanoi and Haiphong at the start. I'm sure this made it
much easier to win! Although to be fair, the set up requires ARVN on the
board which is something I had to pay Political Points to establish, so
perhaps it evened out after all. I did have fun with it in any case.</em>)</p>

<p>This will be game 4 using original rules.</p>

<p>The strategy is to ramp up early with ARVN and Air Cav, then get the US
forces on the map as soon as possible after that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 1: Trail marker left in Laos 4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 2: Trail marker in Laos 4 and Mekong 5.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 3: All ARVN on the board, two lost. Trail left in Laos 4 and
Mekong 5. Air Cav keeps getting hammered, which makes it difficult to
get any of the other US units dow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 4: Trail marker in Laos 4, tough to get rid of this one. Most of
the ARVN down (8), the VC are getting lucky with a lot of 1s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 5: Trail markers in Hanoi 2, Laos 4 and Cambodia 5, with no B52
this turn. Still not bad, only one NVA left on the board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 6: No B52 this turn either. Air Cav goes down again, three times
this game. That's unlucky. Rolled a 6 for offensives, so had to fight
in 3 regions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 7: No GB this turn. Five trail markers down, not good! But the
B52s delivered, Trail is shut down in Haiphong and Hanoi.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 8: No GB or B52, big bummer. Hopefully I'll roll high on the trail
roll… 3 &amp; 4, so add Laos 3, and a good thing I deployed Air Cav
to Highlands 2 last turn. <em>Very</em> lucky rolls this turn on Insurgency,
all NVA cleared, no US/ARVN lost. I think I forgot to bring in NVA
from Haiphong though. However, there is almost no chance given the
results from the others that this would have lost the game even on the
worst rolls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 9: Political roll, cannot emplace Allied ground units, no big
deal as they are almost all on the map anyway. Now have 5 trail
markers down, that's tough. But since there is no ground emplacement,
can use the points for B52 with little risk, and Laos 3 &amp; 4 are
removed. This is going to be a tough turn. If I lose half the
Insurgency rolls, it's game over with a Draw.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 10: No B52 attacks this turn. Trail roll 5 &amp; 6, which already have Trail
markers, very lucky! Good rolls, only lost 1 ARVN.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 11: No B52s, I've been getting a lot that this game, hasn't
seemed to matter too much. GB removed Trail from Haiphong. Things are
starting to get tough, four ARVN off the board, difficult to keep
regions clear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 12: Political roll, no GB attacks, I can live with that. Trail markers
back in Haiphong 1 and Hanoi 2, there are 4 on the board, don't think
I'm going to make it through this turn. Spend 1 point for napalm on VC
in Mekong, too much risk for anything else. I'll take my chances on
the fighting. As it turns out, most of the combat was a draw, so I
retreated units, which will be bad next turn, except this is a major
win as-is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 13: This is major victory even if I don't do anything at all. In
the future, a little more risk might get me into Turn 14. And I did,
got into Turn 14.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 14: No real place to go from here a there are no more political
points available, so it's a matter of seeing how fast the NVA/VC can
eliminate all the US/ARVN units. But I've had enough I think…but
let's see what happens… VC emplaced, no CI… all NVA coming in from
Trail, no CI… offensive in Highlands 2, this is a VC going up
against Air Cav, let's see what happens… VC roll 2, Air Cav roll 3,
both eliminated with 2 PP advance to 16. This leaves only Cu Chi area
free of NVA/VC for a gain of 1 point to 15 which is Game over.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not bad. Went longer than I thought it would, was pretty sure I'd get no
further than Turn 6 or 7. I had some very lucky rolls to be sure.</p>

<p>This was a basic, original game. In the future I'm going to work on the
Advanced game to see if I can crack that one.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
