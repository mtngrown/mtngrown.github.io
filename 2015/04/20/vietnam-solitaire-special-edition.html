                Vietnam Solitaire Special Edition
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 20 2015</time>
              <p>So far, I've been playing the Special Edition of Vietnam Solitaire using
              the original rules. And it's been good. The Special Edition is special
              for a reason: it has special rules, and it's time to put those rules to
              work.</p>
              
              <p>This game, unlike the last game, I'm careful to set up the game
              correctly <em>before</em> starting.</p>
              
              <p>An immediate difference between the two games is the Sudden Death
              criteria. In the original rules, having 14 or more Political Points
              expended at the ended the game as a loss for the Allies. In this game,
              it's losing region control including Saigon to the NVA/VC which loses
              the game.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 1: SAM into Haiphong, Trail into Cambodia 5. GB on Cambodia 5
              roll 6 miss, GB on Laos 3 roll 6 miss. 2 ARVN to Cu Chi, move other
              two ARVN into Area 1-2 Cu Chi. That's all for placement this turn.
              Napalm Mekong 5 roll 4 hit, Siagon 5 roll 1 hit. ARVN hits in Cu Chi,
              clear VC. VC emplaced in Saigon Area 6. NVA enter everywhere!
              Insurgency loss in Hue. Offensive in Saigon, NVA carries the day, they
              have been rolling 1s almost every throw. This game was almost over
              first turn.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 2: SAM added to 2, second Trial to 5. GB to attack Trail Cambodia
              5, roll 4,4 no effect. 4 ARVN into Saigon, regions 3 and 5. Combat in
              Saigon 3, lose NVA and 1 ARVN. VC into Central Saigon. Insurgency in
              Hue 5 and Northern Siagon; Hue roll 1, 3 NVA wins. Saigon roll 1, 2 6,
              NVA and 1 ARVN lost, 1 NVA remains. Offensive in Highlands, naplam
              eliminates VC, now 2 ARVN, 1 NVA roll for 1 ARVN elmination, other
              retreats to 5. Move 3 NVA to Highlands 1. Allies with control 2,
              NVA/VC with control 3.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 3: Political from last turn: No Green Beret, which is fine,
              wasn't going to use them anyway this turn. Trail 2 &amp; 3, but 2 is full
              up already with SAMs as well. B52 attack on 3 and 5: 1 Trail marker
              from Cambodia 5. 1 Air Cav, 2 US and 4 ARVN emplaced. ARVN into
              Saigon, all US into Highlands. Saigon clear. Big battle in Highlands
              roll 10 d6, lose 1 ARVN, 2 NVA, roll again: lose 1 ARVN, 1 US, 1 NVA;
              roll again: 1 NVA, roll…US carries, but expensive. Actually, I got
              the wrong order on that, I did the infiltration first for NVA. No big
              deal. VC infiltration: Highlands 2/5. MAJOR OFFENSIVE! Napalm succeeds
              in Cu Chi and in Mekong. ARVN lost in Saigon, no control. Highlands
              Area 1 controlled.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 4: No GB or B52 this turn. That hurts. Trail roll is 3 &amp; 5.
              US/ARVN placement heavy in Saigon and Highlands. Combat, lose an ARVN
              for a VC, more lucky rolls of 1 for VC. In Area 1 Highlands, NVA roll
              pair of 2s, yikes. Remaining NVA rolled 1. VC and NVA are rolling 1s
              and 2s on almost every battle. Saigon cleared. Offensive in Region 2,
              NVA and VC against ANZAC, roll 1 for VC, ANZAC gone, no control in
              Highlands. However, control marker is now on the track for the first
              time in the game.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 5: No GB or B52 this turn. 3 NVA, 3 dice, snake eyes. Dang.
              VC into Cu Chi. NVA in all over the map. Starting in Hue: ARVN
              carries. Finally. Highlands 1: ALlies carry. Cu Chi 3-4: ARVN carries.
              Saigon: US carries, loses 1. Mekong: napalm carries. Offensive:
              Highlands, VC rolled their usual 1, again…US carries. The US/ARVN
              dice are getting better, but not fast enough to overcome really bad
              rolls early on. Nine Trail counters are on the map.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 6: Political roll: no B52! Dang! Trail to 2 &amp; 4, which puts the
              MIGs on the board and the last Trail counter. This is the last turn
              with 15 political points, starts to go down quickly after this. On the
              plus side, I have all the US and all the non-armor ARVN on the board
              now. If I can just keep it on the board. After combat, we have
              temporary control of Highlands. We'll see what happens after
              infiltration and offensive. VC into Mekong 2, should be no problem to
              handle. Offensive in Saigon, no units, no effect. Advance Region
              Control to 3. This game is still not lost, although it looks pretty
              bad given the situation with the political points.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 7: No GB this turn. I should have just enough political points to
              do 2 B52 and get the rest of the units on the board. B52 takes 1 Trail
              from Laos 3, not enough but still helpful. All Allied units emplaced,
              no combat on emplacement, napalm saved, playing the defensive game
              this turn. VC infiltrate in Mekong 6 where 2 ARVN are lurking in wait,
              this is slanted to ARVN nicely. NVA infiltration left too many units
              on the board, not getting Region Control advancement this turn. Score:
              3/7, losing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 8: Political roll, remove 1 US unit, taken out of Mekong 3-4.
              Turns out I have to remove 2 US ground anyway. So that sucks.
              Trail roll 2 &amp; 4, all 10 Trail back on the map. Remove 1 Trail B52 on
              Cambodia 4. Still getting a lot of units on the map. B52 scores on
              Laos 3. Combat cleared Highlands and Cu Chi. Insurgency rolls, lots of
              1s for the VC/NVA. As usual. Offensive in Hue, VC rolls a 1. As usual.
              4 NVA relocate from Hue to Highlands. Not good. Control marker stays
              at 3, score 3/8.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 9: Political roll: no US ground going in. Also, 2 coming out on
              this turn, 4 out total. Trail into Cambodia 6. All the NVA will be on
              the board this turn, minus NVA armor. B52 success on Cambodia 5, one
              less NVA coming into Saigon.  So many 1s. Allied offensive clears 4
              regions, let's see how much can stay clear. Two ones in a row for NVA
              against 2 ARVN in Saigon. That's just bad luck. No offensive this
              turn. No movement for Region Control, 3/9. I have to carry 3 regions
              for every turn for the next 7 turns to get even a marginal victory.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 10: Not going blow by blow. The result is really not pretty, as
              can be seen in the dice shown below.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Beyond rational belief" src="/images/vietnam-solitaire/all_ones.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Seriously, that's a hint to find something else to do.</p>
              
              <p>I'll pick this game up again later. I'm supposed to play a couple more
              rounds to get it up to 7 plays for h-index, but I might not worry about
              that for a bit. Need to lick my wounds for a while.</p>
              
              <h2 id="blunders">Blunders</h2>
              
              <p>NVA relocation, I didn't really understand that well, and moved a lot of
              NVA from Hue into Highlands over several turns. The way it works is that
              the region from which the NVA are moving may not have any Allied units
              present.</p>
