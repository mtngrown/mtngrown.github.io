Vietnam Solitaire 5 (Special Edition)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 20 2015</time>
<p>So far, I've been playing the Special Edition of Vietnam Solitaire using
the original rules. And it's been good. The Special Edition is special
for a reason: it has special rules, and it's time to put those rules to
work.</p>

<p>This game, unlike the last game, I'm careful to set up the game
correctly <em>before</em> starting.</p>

<p>An immediate difference between the two games is the Sudden Death
criteria. In the original rules, having 14 or more Political Points
expended at the ended the game as a loss for the Allies. In this game,
it's losing region control including Saigon to the NVA/VC which loses
the game.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 1: SAM into Haiphong, Trail into Cambodia 5. GB on Cambodia 5
roll 6 miss, GB on Laos 3 roll 6 miss. 2 ARVN to Cu Chi, move other
two ARVN into Area 1-2 Cu Chi. That's all for placement this turn.
Napalm Mekong 5 roll 4 hit, Siagon 5 roll 1 hit. ARVN hits in Cu Chi,
clear VC. VC emplaced in Saigon Area 6. NVA enter everywhere!
Insurgency loss in Hue. Offensive in Saigon, NVA carries the day, they
have been rolling 1s almost every throw. This game was almost over
first turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 2: SAM added to 2, second Trial to 5. GB to attack Trail Cambodia
5, roll 4,4 no effect. 4 ARVN into Saigon, regions 3 and 5. Combat in
Saigon 3, lose NVA and 1 ARVN. VC into Central Saigon. Insurgency in
Hue 5 and Northern Siagon; Hue roll 1, 3 NVA wins. Saigon roll 1, 2 6,
NVA and 1 ARVN lost, 1 NVA remains. Offensive in Highlands, naplam
eliminates VC, now 2 ARVN, 1 NVA roll for 1 ARVN elmination, other
retreats to 5. Move 3 NVA to Highlands 1. Allies with control 2,
NVA/VC with control 3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 3: Political from last turn: No Green Beret, which is fine,
wasn't going to use them anyway this turn. Trail 2 &amp; 3, but 2 is full
up already with SAMs as well. B52 attack on 3 and 5: 1 Trail marker
from Cambodia 5. 1 Air Cav, 2 US and 4 ARVN emplaced. ARVN into
Saigon, all US into Highlands. Saigon clear. Big battle in Highlands
roll 10 d6, lose 1 ARVN, 2 NVA, roll again: lose 1 ARVN, 1 US, 1 NVA;
roll again: 1 NVA, roll…US carries, but expensive. Actually, I got
the wrong order on that, I did the infiltration first for NVA. No big
deal. VC infiltration: Highlands 2/5. MAJOR OFFENSIVE! Napalm succeeds
in Cu Chi and in Mekong. ARVN lost in Saigon, no control. Highlands
Area 1 controlled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 4: No GB or B52 this turn. That hurts. Trail roll is 3 &amp; 5.
US/ARVN placement heavy in Saigon and Highlands. Combat, lose an ARVN
for a VC, more lucky rolls of 1 for VC. In Area 1 Highlands, NVA roll
pair of 2s, yikes. Remaining NVA rolled 1. VC and NVA are rolling 1s
and 2s on almost every battle. Saigon cleared. Offensive in Region 2,
NVA and VC against ANZAC, roll 1 for VC, ANZAC gone, no control in
Highlands. However, control marker is now on the track for the first
time in the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 5: No GB or B52 this turn. 3 NVA, 3 dice, snake eyes. Dang.
VC into Cu Chi. NVA in all over the map. Starting in Hue: ARVN
carries. Finally. Highlands 1: ALlies carry. Cu Chi 3-4: ARVN carries.
Saigon: US carries, loses 1. Mekong: napalm carries. Offensive:
Highlands, VC rolled their usual 1, again…US carries. The US/ARVN
dice are getting better, but not fast enough to overcome really bad
rolls early on. Nine Trail counters are on the map.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 6: Political roll: no B52! Dang! Trail to 2 &amp; 4, which puts the
MIGs on the board and the last Trail counter. This is the last turn
with 15 political points, starts to go down quickly after this. On the
plus side, I have all the US and all the non-armor ARVN on the board
now. If I can just keep it on the board. After combat, we have
temporary control of Highlands. We'll see what happens after
infiltration and offensive. VC into Mekong 2, should be no problem to
handle. Offensive in Saigon, no units, no effect. Advance Region
Control to 3. This game is still not lost, although it looks pretty
bad given the situation with the political points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 7: No GB this turn. I should have just enough political points to
do 2 B52 and get the rest of the units on the board. B52 takes 1 Trail
from Laos 3, not enough but still helpful. All Allied units emplaced,
no combat on emplacement, napalm saved, playing the defensive game
this turn. VC infiltrate in Mekong 6 where 2 ARVN are lurking in wait,
this is slanted to ARVN nicely. NVA infiltration left too many units
on the board, not getting Region Control advancement this turn. Score:
3/7, losing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 8: Political roll, remove 1 US unit, taken out of Mekong 3-4.
Turns out I have to remove 2 US ground anyway. So that sucks.
Trail roll 2 &amp; 4, all 10 Trail back on the map. Remove 1 Trail B52 on
Cambodia 4. Still getting a lot of units on the map. B52 scores on
Laos 3. Combat cleared Highlands and Cu Chi. Insurgency rolls, lots of
1s for the VC/NVA. As usual. Offensive in Hue, VC rolls a 1. As usual.
4 NVA relocate from Hue to Highlands. Not good. Control marker stays
at 3, score 3/8.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 9: Political roll: no US ground going in. Also, 2 coming out on
this turn, 4 out total. Trail into Cambodia 6. All the NVA will be on
the board this turn, minus NVA armor. B52 success on Cambodia 5, one
less NVA coming into Saigon.  So many 1s. Allied offensive clears 4
regions, let's see how much can stay clear. Two ones in a row for NVA
against 2 ARVN in Saigon. That's just bad luck. No offensive this
turn. No movement for Region Control, 3/9. I have to carry 3 regions
for every turn for the next 7 turns to get even a marginal victory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 10: Not going blow by blow. The result is really not pretty, as
can be seen in the dice shown below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/vietnam-solitaire/all_ones.jpg" alt="Beyond rational belief" /></p>

<p>Seriously, that's a hint to find something else to do.</p>

<p>I'll pick this game up again later. I'm supposed to play a couple more
rounds to get it up to 7 plays for h-index, but I might not worry about
that for a bit. Need to lick my wounds for a while.</p>

<h2 id="blunders">Blunders</h2>

<p>NVA relocation, I didn't really understand that well, and moved a lot of
NVA from Hue into Highlands over several turns. The way it works is that
the region from which the NVA are moving may not have any Allied units
present.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
