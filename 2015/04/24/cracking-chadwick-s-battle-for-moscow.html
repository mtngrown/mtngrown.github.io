Cracking Chadwick's Battle for Moscow
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 24 2015</time>
<p>This is my seventh play of this little classic, and my second win with
the Germans playing solo.  This took me about an hour to crank out, much
faster than it used to.  End result, Germans control Moscow and every
other city except for Ryazan. This is similar to <a href="/2015/02/19/battle-for-moscow-almost-but-not-quite.html">Battle for Moscow
(game 6)</a> I
played a couple of months ago.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/battle-for-moscow/g7_end.jpg" alt="Germans occupy Moscow" /></p>

<p>This picture is immediately prior to the last attack of the game, where
2 Russian armies attack German panzer in Ryanzan. The roll is 3 as shown
on the die, which is an EX for 2:1, so the step loss and retreat through
the EZOCs eliminates the Germans and the Russians advance back into
Ryazan.</p>

<p>The Russian can only muster 18 to 12 for an attack on Moscow, which
would be 1-1 except major cities shift left, and there is no 1-2 odds
column on the CRT. So, they lost.</p>

<p>In past games, I seem to have been under the impression I needed to
control all the cities on the map, not just Moscow. Makes me wonder
about the last solo game I played.</p>

<p>One thing I believe I've gotten wrong in the past is allowing
Russian units which out of communication to flip into full strength.
That's not correct, they have to be in communication with the eastern
edge of the map to go from 4 to 8 for combat. This really makes a
difference, as the Russians can be worn down more effectively after
surrounding, rather than fighting the same battle over and over again.</p>

<p>Another thing I don't think I have been doing correctly is assessing step
losses. This would affect the Russians more than the Germans. The idea
is that the attacker has to take as much strength from a step loss as
the defender. So if three 8-4 Russians attack one 12-6 panzer, and there
is an EX result, the Russians have to lose at least 6 points of
strength. In this case, it would require two step losses for the
Russians.</p>

<p>I have two other games in this series, Objective Kiev for which I've not
yet won as the Germans and Target: Leningrad which I haven't yet played.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
