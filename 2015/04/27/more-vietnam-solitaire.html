More Vietnam Solitaire (6 & 7)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 27 2015</time>
<p>A quick game (6th) using Original Rules over the next couple of days. I'm
slowly figuring this game out.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turn 1: B52 clear both Haiphong and Hanoi. deploy many ARVN, both Air
Cav, 14 PP spent. Combat: VC rolls 1 for each, costing 3 pp. US/ARVN
control in only 2 regions, game over, lose!</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok. Well. That was fast.</p>

<p>This was too aggressive, should have put all the arvn down, maybe 1 us
but not air cav. The key is to deny vc/nva control early turns, then
gain control through the middle turns as all the units can be put on the
map, then gradually relinquish control as unuts are attrited and pp
decreases.</p>

<p>I was going to run the Easter Offensive rules next, but I might just
have to try the Original Rules again.</p>

<h2 id="take-2">Take 2</h2>

<p>Let's try this again for Game 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 1, 1963: Trail emplaced in L4, C5. B52 Haiphong 1, succeeds,
Cambodia 5 succeeds, two Trail removed. Get the ARVN on the map,
Air Cav down in Saigon 5, will move it later. This is 12 PP.
Infiltration VC Saigon Area 2, no combat. NVA Hue 3 where there are two
ARVN, time to fight: goes to ARVN. Offensive in Region 1, VC moves to
3-4, another round with the ARVN, roll goes to ARVN. Move Air Cav to
Highlands.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 2, 1964: Political roll 4 - 1, no GB this turn. Trail to 1 and 4,
already on 4, good luck. B52 roll 5, 5, miss everywhere. Movement and
combat, US/ARVN has 4 Regions, let's see what infiltration brings. Not
good, two ARVN and control. Offensive, decided to move ARVN from city
in Hue instead of risking another loss which would PP at 16, so moved
them to Hue 5, but the offensive roll is 1, hence, ARVN now fighting
anyway at way lower odds. However, they did it, rolling a 1 which was
needed against the NVA, where the NVA rolled a 5 and needed a 2. So,
no control in Hue, but dodged a virtual bullet there. Control 3, PP at
12, good to go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn 3, 1965: Political roll 3, no GB. Trail 5 &amp; 6. B52 on 2 &amp; 5, both
succeed, three Trail markers on map. Infiltration a disaster for
US/ARVN, loss of troops and loss of control. Offensive, 6! This might
work, with luck, because it puts NVA/VC into position where they can
be fought and eliminated. But nope, first roll NVA takes out Air Cav,
Mekong is lost to NVA/VC. So control of 4 regions puts PP at 12, but
advancing 2 for VC control on Mekong ends the game right here.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I know for sure my previous big "wins" in this game were a result of
small blunders or a rule being overlooked. Playing it very, very close
to the rules (as exactly correct as I understand them) is showing that
there is still quite a bit of nuance left to discover. For example,
moving ARVN into jungle areas to fight along side US. That way they take
the first casualties on lucky rolls by the VC. Knowing when and when not
to attempt control. Attempting more control leads to more losses, hence
losing more political points, and it costs more political points to get
the troops on the board to fight in the first place.</p>

<p>Still more to learn!</p>

<p>This is my seventh game of this title, which also hits my h-index goal
of 7, so I'm going to put it away for a bit and work on some other</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
