                More Vietnam Solitaire
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 27 2015</time>
              <p>A quick game using Original Rules over the next couple of days. I'm
              slowly figuring this game out.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Turn 1: B52 clear both Haiphong and Hanoi. deploy many ARVN, both Air
              Cav, 14 PP spent. Combat: VC rolls 1 for each, costing 3 pp. US/ARVN
              control in only 2 regions, game over, lose!</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Ok. Well. That was fast.</p>
              
              <p>This was too aggressive, should have put all the arvn down, maybe 1 us
              but not air cav. The key is to deny vc/nva control early turns, then
              gain control through the middle turns as all the units can be put on the
              map, then gradually relinquish control as unuts are attrited and pp
              decreases.</p>
              
              <p>I was going to run the Easter Offensive rules next, but I might just
              have to try the Original Rules again.</p>
              
              <h2 id="take-2">Take 2</h2>
              
              <p>Let's try this again.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 1, 1963: Trail emplaced in L4, C5. B52 Haiphong 1, succeeds,
              Cambodia 5 succeeds, two Trail removed. Get the ARVN on the map,
              Air Cav down in Saigon 5, will move it later. This is 12 PP.
              Infiltration VC Saigon Area 2, no combat. NVA Hue 3 where there are two
              ARVN, time to fight: goes to ARVN. Offensive in Region 1, VC moves to
              3-4, another round with the ARVN, roll goes to ARVN. Move Air Cav to
              Highlands.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 2, 1964: Political roll 4 - 1, no GB this turn. Trail to 1 and 4,
              already on 4, good luck. B52 roll 5, 5, miss everywhere. Movement and
              combat, US/ARVN has 4 Regions, let's see what infiltration brings. Not
              good, two ARVN and control. Offensive, decided to move ARVN from city
              in Hue instead of risking another loss which would PP at 16, so moved
              them to Hue 5, but the offensive roll is 1, hence, ARVN now fighting
              anyway at way lower odds. However, they did it, rolling a 1 which was
              needed against the NVA, where the NVA rolled a 5 and needed a 2. So,
              no control in Hue, but dodged a virtual bullet there. Control 3, PP at
              12, good to go.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn 3, 1965: Political roll 3, no GB. Trail 5 &amp; 6. B52 on 2 &amp; 5, both
              succeed, three Trail markers on map. Infiltration a disaster for
              US/ARVN, loss of troops and loss of control. Offensive, 6! This might
              work, with luck, because it puts NVA/VC into position where they can
              be fought and eliminated. But nope, first roll NVA takes out Air Cav,
              Mekong is lost to NVA/VC. So control of 4 regions puts PP at 12, but
              advancing 2 for VC control on Mekong ends the game right here.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>I know for sure my previous big "wins" in this game were a result of
              small blunders or a rule being overlooked. Playing it very, very close
              to the rules (as exactly correct as I understand them) is showing that
              there is still quite a bit of nuance left to discover. For example,
              moving ARVN into jungle areas to fight along side US. That way they take
              the first casualties on lucky rolls by the VC. Knowing when and when not
              to attempt control. Attempting more control leads to more losses, hence
              losing more political points, and it costs more political points to get
              the troops on the board to fight in the first place.</p>
              
              <p>Still more to learn!</p>
              
              <p>This is my seventh game of this title, which also hits my h-index goal
              of 7, so I'm going to put it away for a bit and work on some other</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.

                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
