                The Hapsburg Reign
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 28 2015</time>
              <p>(Note: I actually played this yesterday, but didn't want to write it up
              with the two short Vietnam Solitaire games I also played.)</p>
              
              <p>While I'm in the mood, let's knock out a game of Hapsburg Eclipse. This
              should go pretty fast, I usually lose. Unlike Soviet Dawn, I don't yet
              have a strategy for this game.</p>
              
              <p>In order of the draw:</p>
              
              <p><code>03.</code> Serbian battle of Cer, lose.</p>
              
              <p><code>06.</code> Russian cipher cracked.</p>
              
              <p><code>13.</code> Czechoslovak Legion. Not doing well, Czech advanced 2 spaces and
                they are hard to get loyalty back.</p>
              
              <p><code>16.</code> McKansen Takes Command. Finally getting a bit of a break here.
                Going to lose Czech loyalty pretty soon though.</p>
              
              <p><code>07.</code> Drina Campaign. Czech in revolt, and lucky roll moves them back.
                This is important as Czech revolt is -1 DRM on Polish and Carpathian.</p>
              
              <p><code>05.</code> Battle of Tannenburg. Had to spend another Radio Intercept to deal
              with Carpathian. 1 left.</p>
              
              <p><code>01.</code> Second Army out of position. Polish and Carpathian advance into
              bad country. One action only, nothing easy, roll against Polish at -1
              DRM, roll 3 for 2, blah.</p>
              
              <p><code>04.</code> Battle of Mons.</p>
              
              <p><code>02.</code> Drive into Galicia.</p>
              
              <p><code>11.</code> Putnik Reclaims Belgrade. Lost the off-map Belgrade, succeeded in
              driving back Polish and Carpathian.</p>
              
              <p><code>35.</code> German Aid.</p>
              
              <p><code>15.</code> Treaty of London. Add the Day cards.</p>
              
              <p><code>34.</code> Hungarian Food Shortages. National Will is at -4, this is not
              good.</p>
              
              <p><code>27.</code> Provisional Government Takes Charge. This one is interesting as it
              weakens the Polish and Carpathian Fronts, which is <em>really</em> helpful
              about right now. Also retreated the Italians 2 spaces.</p>
              
              <p><code>19.</code> Battle of Ctesiphon. Victory. National Will back to 0. Still in
              the game. Would be nice to get the loyalties dealt with.</p>
              
              <p><code>14.</code> Gallipoli Campaign. And Hungarians are in revolt. Chose to
              provision naval resources with 2 actions, can afford the hit to victory
              points and DRM on Carpathian.</p>
              
              <p><code>18.</code> von Lettow-Vorbeck. Things are holding on pretty well at the
              moment, need to get Hungary and Croat out of revolt.</p>
              
              <p><code>20.</code> Strafexpidition. Now Czech is in revolt, but brought it back with
              Croat.</p>
              
              <p><code>29.</code> Otranto Barrage.</p>
              
              <p><code>33.</code> Battle of Passchendaele. Victory with a roll of 5. Needed.
              National Will +1, best I've ever made it this title.</p>
              
              <p><code>26.</code> Fighting in the Trentino. Loyalty is bedeviling.</p>
              
              <p><code>10.</code> German 9th Army.</p>
              
              <p><code>24.</code> Danube Flotilla Sails. I'm about half way through the deck. This
              is a more complex game than Soviet Dawn, and takes longer to play.</p>
              
              <p><code>22.</code> Romania Joins Allies. This brings in the last deck, which I don't
              recall having played into yet.</p>
              
              <p><code>23.</code> Flamanda Maneuver.</p>
              
              <p><code>31.</code> Kerensky Offensive. Everything advances! Fortunately no triggers.
              All offensives succeed for me, which is good because the National Will
              would have dropped like a stone here.</p>
              
              <p><code>44.</code> Greece Enters the War. Fortunately Balkan Front is not yet
              entered.</p>
              
              <p><code>49.</code> National Parliament Reconvened.</p>
              
              <p><code>38.</code> Rommel's Alpine Corps. Going all three against Italian, big risk
              as Romanian is at Belgrade. Will use a radio intercept on that if
              necessary. 5 flags are down, but I'm up 3 on off-map victories.
              Otherwise I'd be looking at sudden death.</p>
              
              <p><code>28.</code> Romanian Army Reformed. Romanian goes from 2 to 4. National Will
              at -3.</p>
              
              <p><code>45.</code> War Weariness. No actions allowed. National Will at -5. Next card
              will be interesting.</p>
              
              <p><code>40.</code> Focsani Armstice. Should be able to hold on this card. Romanian
              back one, got a flag back.</p>
              
              <p><code>32.</code> Corfu Declaration. Just figured out about the Italian Front at
              Udine needing to roll to advance. I'm not going to advance the Italians
              for a couple of turns to see if I can make it up.</p>
              
              <p><code>48.</code> D'Esperey Breaks out. I don't understand the action on this card
              so I'm ignoring it.</p>
              
              <p><code>36.</code> Bolshevik Revolution. I think I needed to cancel an
              advanceâ€¦because my rolls this card were crap. However, it does say to
              simply remove the Polish and Carpathian Fronts. So, that helps a lot.
              National Will at -1.</p>
              
              <p><code>43.</code> Peace Feelers. Retreating Italian to Udine.</p>
              
              <p><code>47.</code> Flight Over Vienna.</p>
              
              <p><code>39.</code> Diaz Takes Command. Time to cancel the Romanian advance, because
              they would be in Vienna if not. I did not roll against Romania with
              McKansee, which is likely a mistake. National Will at -2.</p>
              
              <p><code>37.</code> Caporetto Offensive. Flips Italian to higher value.</p>
              
              <p><code>46.</code> Dismissal of Conrad.</p>
              
              <p><code>12.</code> Battle of Dogger Bank. Victory. Things are looking up.</p>
              
              <p><code>30.</code> Nivelle Offensive.</p>
              
              <p><code>41.</code> Palestine Campaign. Defeat.</p>
              
              <p><code>42.</code> KaiserSchlacht Begins. Victory for the first.</p>
              
              <p><code>50.</code> Czech Declaration of Independence. I don't understand the actions
              for this turn, as stated for rolling on Czech Loyalty.</p>
              
              <p><code>09.</code> Battle of Falkland Islands. Victory.</p>
              
              <p><code>08.</code> Battle of Lodz.</p>
              
              <p><code>17.</code> Bulgaria Joins the War.</p>
              
              <p><code>25.</code> Death of Franz Josef.</p>
              
              <p><code>21.</code> Brusilov Offensive. And that's the game. I think I bona fide won
              this one.</p>
              
              <p>Nearest I can figure, this scores to 29 as follows: 2 VP for Croat and
              Hungary in loyalty, 12 VP for Fronts on the map (Balkan 5, Romanian 4,
              Italian 3), 11 VP for Polish and Carpathian removed, and 4 National
              Will.</p>
              
              <p>This is stated as a "Strategic Victory."</p>
              
              <p>This game takes about twice as long as Soviet Dawn for me to play,
              despite having the same number of cards. Probably because I don't know
              the rules as well.</p>

              <p><strong>Italian Advances</strong> past Udine require rolling less than it's battle
              value to advance. I have not been playing this way, hence, I've been
              wasting rolls on Italian Front. Bummer.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Advancing Romanian on Balkan Track</strong> which is just stupid.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.

                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
