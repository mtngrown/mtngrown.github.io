Objective Kiev continues to frustrate
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  1 2015</time>
<p>I'm not sure exactly why I'm not getting a handle on Objective Kiev.
Several possibilities come to mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The rules are two pages longer (more complicated) than Battle for Moscow, a
game with similar scope and (ostensibly) in the same rule system.  Two pages
is roughly 50% more rules.</li>
  <li>In three out of four games, the Russian 4th mechanized corps has been
randomly positioned just north of Lyov, the absolute best possibly
place to completely repel German breakthrough, and it fact, it has.</li>
  <li>The turn phasing on the map is incorrect for the Germans, which
  requires a mental leap every German turn.</li>
  <li>I haven't written out any of these games in much detail, which is
  always useful for really learning the rules.</li>
  <li>I seem to have a fair bit of trouble keeping track of whose turn and
  which phase is underway at any particular time.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are possibly other reasons, but the above will do for now.</p>

<p>Writing everything out in detail as I play definitely helps keep track
of game play, so for Turns 6 &amp; 7 of an ongoing game, here's what's going
down.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>Looks hopeless for the Germans as the Russians have bolstered Kiev. The
Germans must try for Kiev anyway, which is something the Russians know.
The Russians don't have to do a lot more than keep the Germans bottled
up in the west. They have all their units on the map, so they're in good
shape for this.</p>

<h3 id="german-turn-6">German turn 6</h3>

<h4 id="replacementreinforcement">Replacement/reinforcement</h4>

<p>Bring in the 4th Inf as replacements.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase">Movement phase</h4>

<p>Two places:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Over to Kiev</li>
  <li>Position for breakthrough in the west.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="combat-phase">Combat phase</h4>

<ul>
  <li>3:1 for breakthrough, needed all air for this DRL result.</li>
  <li>1:1 at Kiev, did not use any air, EX result.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="armor-and-reserve-movement">Armor and reserve movement</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Italians on the east edge to control Soviet communication and
replacement entry.</li>
  <li>48 Pz creeps around Soviet units, still cannot get
out of EZOCs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="russian-turn-6">Russian Turn 6</h3>

<h4 id="replacements">Replacements</h4>

<p>Bring in 6-3-6 Mechanized, 4-4 infantry.</p>

<h4 id="rail">Rail</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Move replacement to negate EZOC on Italian on east edge.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="combat">Combat</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Drive German 34 Inf back to Lyov, advance into vacated hex.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="movement">Movement</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Close the line around the Germans, again.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<h3 id="german-turn-7">German Turn 7</h3>

<h4 id="replacements-1">Replacements</h4>

<p>44 Inf back in west of Lublin.</p>

<h4 id="movement-1">Movement</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Position to get try and break the Russian defensive line.</li>
  <li>Reposition to take another crack at Kiev.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="combat-1">Combat</h4>

<ul>
  <li>2:1 Kiev, roll 4 NE</li>
  <li>2:1 against 16 mech, roll 5 NE</li>
  <li>1:1 against 12 Inf, roll 3 EX, hurts the Germans.</li>
  <li>1:1 against 15 and 22 mech, roll 5 NE.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="armor-and-reserve-movement-1">Armor and reserve movement</h4>

<p>Moot, game is lost, Russians don't need to do anything at all for a win.</p>

<h3 id="russian-turn-7">Russian Turn 7</h3>

<p>Russian win.</p>

<h4 id="replacements-2">Replacements</h4>

<h4 id="railmechanized-movement">Rail/mechanized movement</h4>

<h4 id="combat-2">Combat</h4>

<h4 id="movement-2">Movement</h4>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This was the worst game yet for the Germans. They didn't just lose, they
lost by a stupendous amount. They weren't even able to break through in
the west as the Russian defensive line held.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Initial Soviet attack strengths: These are doubled on Turn 1, and
increased by 50% on Turn 2, thereafter what's on the counter. This
hardly seems necessary given how well the Soviets utterly destroy the
Germans in this game without it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attacking from stacked hexes: I keep forgetting only one unit can
attack through a given hex side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forgetting that Russian mechanized have a defense strength. I've been
using the attack strength for defense.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
