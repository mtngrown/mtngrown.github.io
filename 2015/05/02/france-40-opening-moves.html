<p>France '40 Sickle Cut is an interesting scenario, because historically
the Germans launched the campaign with a series of battles in and around
Sedan France which left the French defenders demoralized, essentially,
routed. Capturing that historical result is difficult. In the game, the
French need enough strength to put up more than a token defense, but
that much strength could potentially either maul the Germans, or slow
them way down, or both.</p>

<p>What this session investigates is how the opening moves play out over
the first few turns, focusing on the French 2d Army located south of the
Meuse River at Sedan. There are best case first turn attacks for the
Germans, but it's not clear what the risks of those attacks are. This
won't be a complete game, merely a play of the situation in the south.
Units in the north will not be moved.</p>

<p><strong>Can we add supply into this? Would like to understand more about
manuever warfare.</strong></p>

<p>Here's the setup:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/sedan-setup.jpg" alt="France '40 May 13 1940 around Sedan" /></p>

<p>For the first sequence, we won't roll the dice, we'll choose the worst
result for the combat situation and play it from there.</p>

<h2 id="worst-case-results">Worst case results</h2>

<p>The worst case result is the Germans don't ever get across at Sedan.
This is what happened during my <a href="/2015/03/08/sickle-cut-first-play.html">first Sickle Cut
game</a>. This was a result of
insufficient aggression and bad rolling. 1 and 10 Pz eventually just
left the area and rolled at full strength through the Ardennes and on
into western France.</p>

<p>A second worst case result would be losing one or more steps of armor
getting across over several turns. I suppose an even worse case would be
to lose the armor steps and not get across, and not have that armor for
later action in the west.</p>

<p>The "worst" case for a first combat result is successful determined
defenses with an attacker step loss.</p>

<p>I think it comes down to whether the Germans should try to cross the
Meuse in Turn 1 in the south, or wait until they can bring up infantry
to help soak up losses on Turns 2 and 3.</p>

<p>It's interesting that my attempt at this I roll for both attacks and get
a result of attacker loss, and a succesful determined defense.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1-may-13-1940">Turn 1, May 13, 1940</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Describe the main challenge to the German player this turn, and one or

<h4 id="german-initial-phase">German Initial Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Flip all Air units from Used to Ready side.</p>

<h4 id="german-movement-phase">German Movement Phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>German player may move all, some or none of the German units (7.0).</li>
  <li>Reinforcements enter (19.0).</li>
  <li>Note Extended Movement (7.3) and EZOC +2 MP penalty (5.2).</li>
  <li>Compute Automatic DS (10.1, 14.2)</li>
</ul>

<p>And here's an "optimal" attack configuration for the Germans on Turn 1
after the German movement phase:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/may-13-german-attack.jpg" alt="France '40 May 13 Germans movement around Sedan" /></p>

<p>6 Pz is essentially "in reserve" for next turn because it's vulnerable
to a 1:1 (but still dangerous attack) during the Allies phase.</p>

<h4 id="german-combat-phase">German Combat Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German player conducts all attacks (8.0) including Overruns
(15.0) and Disengagement Attempts (20.4).</p>

<p>From the picture above, two attacks across the Meuse northwest of Sedan.
These are both risky, there is a chance that the Germans will completely
fail to cross with any units, and further, take step losses and have to
deal with reinforced French units in the same locations next turn. On
the other hand, there is a chance that both defending units will
completely rout, and allow all German units to advance (modulo stacking
and river crossing constraints).</p>

<ol>
  <li>1 and 10 Pz attack 55 Inf, GD in reserve.
  * Defending 6 with low TQ, doubled in defense across river for 12
  * Attacking 24 with high TQ, halved attacking across river for 12.
  * Odds 1:1 with shifts * 2R for Air, 2R for TQ, 1L for HQ, net 4:1.</li>
  <li>2 Pz attacking 53 Inf.
  * Defending 6 with low TQ, doubled in defense across river for 12
  * Attacking 12 with high TQ, halved in attacking across river.
  * Odds 1:2 with shifts 2R for TQ, 3R for Air, net 4:1.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is assuming the French player chooses even odds on HQ left shift.
Otherwise the odds could be 5:1 and 3:1, or shifting the Air, 6:1 and
2:1.</p>

<p>36 and 69 Inf. will wait for more reinforcements to attack in the
Maginot Line area.</p>

<p>The French have 5 of 6 results which will allow determined defense here.
The Determined Defense doesn't make sense for the French if they have
already lost a step, as there is 50% chance they will lose another step
and 5/6 chance they would have had to retreat anyway.</p>

<p>Side note: My first game the French got lucky and shut down the Germans
completely here, probably because I only made one attack which was an EX
result.</p>

<p>What we'll do here is EX for both attacks, and take the step losses on
the panzer brigades. This is really a bad result for the Germans.</p>

<p>Massing in the Ardennes for a breakthrough at the bluffs. This is
leaving the lower part of the German rear exposed to shutting down an
entry point by 3 Colonial, but that would lose that unit, D would not be
shut down completely, and it would expose the Maginot Line horribly. In
a sense, leaving a weak flank is baiting the French to cross the Meuse
on an offensive, whence they will get hammered by the Germans.</p>

<h4 id="german-combat-phase-2">German Combat Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German player conducts all attacks (8.0) including Overruns
(15.0) and Disengagement Attempts (20.4).</p>

<p>Three attacks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>North end:
  * Defending 61 Inf with 6 double to 12 for river.
  * Attacking total 24 halved by river to 12.
  * Odds 1:1 shift 1L for HQ, 2R for TQ, 1R for Air net 3:1.
  * Roll 4 for DR, French take the retreat to hold the line.</li>
  <li>Middle:
  * 42/102 Bgd. defense 4 doubled for river to 8.
  * Attacking 16 halved to 8.
  * Odds 1:1 shift 1R TQ 1R Air net 3:1
  * Roll 4 for DR, French take the retreat as it will hold the line.</li>
  <li>1:1, crappy but using leg which can take the pounding, roll 2 for A1.</li>
</ol>

<p>These could have easily been all A1 or EX results intead of DR, in which
case the Germans would be in a <em>serious</em> bind. The front is too narrow
there to punch through easily, and the French can rotate in fresh units
while the Germans grind themselves down in futile attacks.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Turn 1 only) Dyle Line construction.</li>
  <li>Reinforcements enter (19.0).</li>
  <li>Note Extended Movement (7.3)</li>
</ul>

<p>Looks like the Germans have at least some sort of breakthrough. What the
Allies did last time was pinch this off to run the Germans out of supply
by the end of the game. That's going to have to be the strategy this
time as well. However, may be able to pinch them off a lot earlier.</p>

<h4 id="allied-combat-phase-3">Allied Combat Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Allied player conducts all attacks (8.0) including Overruns
(15.0) and Disengagement Attempts (20.4).</p>

<p>One combat, which was probably ill-advised, taking on the GD at 1:1 raw,
which was 1:2 with a shift. Roll was 6, but the unit was surrounded, so
totally eliminated while taking down GD one step. Determined Defense
failed. It would have been better to leave this unit in there to
roablock the Germans with its ZOC.</p>

<h4 id="allied-recovery-phase-3">Allied Recovery Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Remove Disruption markers if possible (13.3).</p>

<p>Recover detrained units.</p>

<h4 id="allied-supply-phase-3">Allied Supply Phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Check supply status (18.0)  for all Allied units</li>
  <li>Roll for attrition (18.5) for
    <ul>
      <li>out of supply units</li>
      <li>units adjacent to enemy units</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All good.</p>

<h3 id="end-phase-3">End Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Move the game turn counter and proceed to next turn.</p>

<p>All done.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This is the end of this small game, as shown below:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/g2-t4-end.jpg" alt="End of Turn 4 and game" /></p>

<p>What would happen next for the Germans is a swing to the south to
surround the forces around Charleville and run them out of supply. This
would force them to either pull way back, or lose units fighting. Not
sure if it would work, would be fun to try. The last game I sent the
Germans straight west without paying enough attention to the salient.</p>

<h3 id="a-small-scenario">A small scenario</h3>

<p>A good scenario might be to make victory points depend on how many
German units can get to hex 4000 by the end of Turn 5. Reinforcements
could be abstracted in on the Train by retarding movement for a turn,
and allowing only 5 hexes movement first train move.</p>

<p>The situation in the north could probably be handled the same way. For
the first few turns, these seem to be completely different battles.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
