                France '40 opening moves
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  2 2015</time>
              <p>France '40 Sickle Cut is an interesting scenario, because historically
              the Germans launched the campaign with a series of battles in and around
              Sedan France which left the French defenders demoralized, essentially,
              routed. Capturing that historical result is difficult. In the game, the
              French need enough strength to put up more than a token defense, but
              that much strength could potentially either maul the Germans, or slow
              them way down, or both.</p>
              
              <p>What this session investigates is how the opening moves play out over
              the first few turns, focusing on the French 2d Army located south of the
              Meuse River at Sedan. There are best case first turn attacks for the
              Germans, but it's not clear what the risks of those attacks are. This
              won't be a complete game, merely a play of the situation in the south.
              Units in the north will not be moved.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Can we add supply into this? Would like to understand more about
              manuever warfare.</strong></p>
              
              <p>Here's the setup:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="France '40 May 13 1940 around Sedan" src="/images/france40/sedan-setup.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>For the first sequence, we won't roll the dice, we'll choose the worst
              result for the combat situation and play it from there.</p>
              
              <h2 id="worst-case-results">Worst case results</h2>
              
              <p>The worst case result is the Germans don't ever get across at Sedan.
              This is what happened during my <a href="/2015/03/08/sickle-cut-first-play.html">first Sickle Cut
              game</a>. This was a result of
              insufficient aggression and bad rolling. 1 and 10 Pz eventually just
              left the area and rolled at full strength through the Ardennes and on
              into western France.</p>
              
              <p>A second worst case result would be losing one or more steps of armor
              getting across over several turns. I suppose an even worse case would be
              to lose the armor steps and not get across, and not have that armor for
              later action in the west.</p>
              
              <p>The "worst" case for a first combat result is successful determined
              defenses with an attacker step loss.</p>
              
              <p>I think it comes down to whether the Germans should try to cross the
              Meuse in Turn 1 in the south, or wait until they can bring up infantry
              to help soak up losses on Turns 2 and 3.</p>
              
              <p>It's interesting that my attempt at this I roll for both attacks and get
              a result of attacker loss, and a succesful determined defense.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1-may-13-1940">Turn 1, May 13, 1940</h2>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">(Turn 1) Provide a broad description of the situation, and some notion of the
              challenges faced by the Allied and German players. (Remaining turns)

              <p class="turn-sequence">Flip all Air units from Used to Ready side.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-movement-phase">German Movement Phase</h4>
              
              <ul class="turn-sequence">

              </ul>
              
              <p>And here's an "optimal" attack configuration for the Germans on Turn 1
              after the German movement phase:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="France '40 May 13 Germans movement around Sedan" src="/images/france40/may-13-german-attack.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>6 Pz is essentially "in reserve" for next turn because it's vulnerable
              to a 1:1 (but still dangerous attack) during the Allies phase.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-combat-phase">German Combat Phase</h4>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">German player conducts all attacks (8.0) including Overruns
              (15.0) and Disengagement Attempts (20.4).</p>
              
              <p>From the picture above, two attacks across the Meuse northwest of Sedan.
              These are both risky, there is a chance that the Germans will completely
              fail to cross with any units, and further, take step losses and have to
              deal with reinforced French units in the same locations next turn. On
              the other hand, there is a chance that both defending units will
              completely rout, and allow all German units to advance (modulo stacking
              and river crossing constraints).</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>1 and 10 Pz attack 55 Inf, GD in reserve.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Defending 6 with low TQ, doubled in defense across river for 12</li>
                    <li>Attacking 24 with high TQ, halved attacking across river for 12.</li>
                    <li>Odds 1:1 with shifts * 2R for Air, 2R for TQ, 1L for HQ, net 4:1.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>2 Pz attacking 53 Inf.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Defending 6 with low TQ, doubled in defense across river for 12</li>
                    <li>Attacking 12 with high TQ, halved in attacking across river.</li>
                    <li>Odds 1:2 with shifts 2R for TQ, 3R for Air, net 4:1.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>This is assuming the French player chooses even odds on HQ left shift.
              Otherwise the odds could be 5:1 and 3:1, or shifting the Air, 6:1 and
              2:1.</p>
              
              <p>36 and 69 Inf. will wait for more reinforcements to attack in the
              Maginot Line area.</p>
              
              <p>The French have 5 of 6 results which will allow determined defense here.
              The Determined Defense doesn't make sense for the French if they have
              already lost a step, as there is 50% chance they will lose another step
              and 5/6 chance they would have had to retreat anyway.</p>
              
              <p>Side note: My first game the French got lucky and shut down the Germans
              completely here, probably because I only made one attack which was an EX
              result.</p>
              
              <p>What we'll do here is EX for both attacks, and take the step losses on
              the panzer brigades. This is really a bad result for the Germans.</p>

              DLM 2 and 3 up in the north. The recovery roll removes the GQG on DLM 2

              <p>Looks like the Germans have at least some sort of breakthrough. What the
              Allies did last time was pinch this off to run the Germans out of supply
              by the end of the game. That's going to have to be the strategy this
              time as well. However, may be able to pinch them off a lot earlier.</p>

              which was 1:2 with a shift. Roll was 6, but the unit was surrounded, so
              totally eliminated while taking down GD one step. Determined Defense
              failed. It would have been better to leave this unit in there to

              <p>What would happen next for the Germans is a swing to the south to
              surround the forces around Charleville and run them out of supply. This
              would force them to either pull way back, or lose units fighting. Not
              sure if it would work, would be fun to try. The last game I sent the
              Germans straight west without paying enough attention to the salient.</p>
              
              <h3 id="a-small-scenario">A small scenario</h3>
              
              <p>A good scenario might be to make victory points depend on how many
              German units can get to hex 4000 by the end of Turn 5. Reinforcements
              could be abstracted in on the Train by retarding movement for a turn,
              and allowing only 5 hexes movement first train move.</p>
              
              <p>The situation in the north could probably be handled the same way. For
              the first few turns, these seem to be completely different battles.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
