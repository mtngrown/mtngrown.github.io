France 40 as Allies
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  9 2015</time>
<p>Wild game which swung to German then back to Allies.</p>

<p>If the Germans cross at Sedan on turn 1, it's a totally different game
than if the French are able to hold for their turn 1 movement.</p>

<p>Getting that foothold at Sedan with no loss of forces allowed the
Germans to punch the shit out of the defensive line. In four turns,
everything between Sedan and Charleville wiped out.</p>

<p>Also, I didn't play with 2 panzer division stacks, and that makes a
really big difference.</p>

<p>I've tried to maintain a line but next time I think the French need to
pull way back as fast as possible to preserve units. Otherwise they just
get chewed up. Basically, if they get through at Sedan, it seems
pointless to try and hold a line, the Germans will just punch holes in
at will.</p>

<p>However, at turn 5, Germans exited a panzer division and   2 mech
regiments in southeast and east. This feels early to me, I may be able
to cut them off from supply by the end of the game.</p>

<p>Between capturing GQG units in a zoc, and infantry units, the French
can't get away, it costs 2 mps to leave a zoc.</p>

<p>Germans got a lot of DS results consistently getting 5:1 and 6:1
attacks.</p>

<p>However, around Turn 5 or 6, the Germans got sidetracked around Namur
and chasing some French units around the western edge of the Ardennes.
This turned out to be good news for the Allies, who were able to
recover a defensive position to the west and preserve the north to south
rail connection.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Allies were able to cut off supply to exit hexes
previously closed off by German units.</p>

<p>Even better for the Allies, a last minute German rush to attempt to put
the exit hexes back into supply allowed the Allies to cut supply to 10
mechanized units.</p>

<p>So the game went from looking almost hopeless for the Allies to a
crushing defeat to the Germans.</p>

<p>Final score: 20 to 6</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
