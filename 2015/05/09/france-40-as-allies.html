                France 40 as Allies
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  9 2015</time>
              <p>Wild game which swung to German then back to Allies.</p>
              
              <p>If the Germans cross at Sedan on turn 1, it's a totally different game
              than if the French are able to hold for their turn 1 movement.</p>
              
              <p>Getting that foothold at Sedan with no loss of forces allowed the
              Germans to punch the shit out of the defensive line. In four turns,
              everything between Sedan and Charleville wiped out.</p>
              
              <p>Also, I didn't play with 2 panzer division stacks, and that makes a
              really big difference.</p>
              
              <p>I've tried to maintain a line but next time I think the French need to
              pull way back as fast as possible to preserve units. Otherwise they just
              get chewed up. Basically, if they get through at Sedan, it seems
              pointless to try and hold a line, the Germans will just punch holes in
              at will.</p>
              
              <p>However, at turn 5, Germans exited a panzer division and   2 mech
              regiments in southeast and east. This feels early to me, I may be able
              to cut them off from supply by the end of the game.</p>
              
              <p>Between capturing GQG units in a zoc, and infantry units, the French
              can't get away, it costs 2 mps to leave a zoc.</p>
              
              <p>Germans got a lot of DS results consistently getting 5:1 and 6:1
              attacks.</p>
              
              <p>However, around Turn 5 or 6, the Germans got sidetracked around Namur
              and chasing some French units around the western edge of the Ardennes.
              This turned out to be good news for the Allies, who were able to
              recover a defensive position to the west and preserve the north to south
              rail connection.</p>
              
              <p>Additionally, the Allies were able to cut off supply to exit hexes
              previously closed off by German units.</p>
              
              <p>Even better for the Allies, a last minute German rush to attempt to put
              the exit hexes back into supply allowed the Allies to cut supply to 10
              mechanized units.</p>
              
              <p>So the game went from looking almost hopeless for the Allies to a
              crushing defeat to the Germans.</p>
              
              <p>Final score: 20 to 6</p>

                  More PanzerBlitz. Situation 11 has not seen
                  any plays at all, and Situation 7 only a single solo play. Situations 10
                  and 12 have only been played FtF, without a detailed writeup.

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
