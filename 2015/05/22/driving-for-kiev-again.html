Driving for Kiev, again
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 22 2015</time>
<p>Once again, I pound my head against the stubborn little game "Objective
Kiev." This is supposed to be fairly well-balanced, but I've never come
even close to winning this as the Germans. Granted, my last game was
full of blunders mostly against the Germans, so maybe this game will go
a bit better. After all, it took me 6 games to crack Battle for Moscow.</p>

<p>For easy reference, here's the write up for <a href="/2015/05/01/objective-kiev-continues-to-frustrate.html">Objective Kiev Game
4</a>.</p>

<p>This game, I'm going to treat at least the first few turns as a learning
game and write a bunch of the phases out with rule citations. It's the
only way I know to really get a good grip on any game.</p>

<p>Also, I'm going to put the damn Soviet 4th Mech somewhere in the hinterland.
I'll worry about beating that s.o.b. after I have a more statistically
common situation figured out.</p>

<h4 id="replacements">Replacements</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">See Section 12.2 of the rules, note especially that on-map Russian units

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the game turn marker. Summarize the results for the turn for
each player. Were goals achieved or stymied?</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Summarize the situation in the upcoming turn for both players.</p>

<p>The German plan is to break through as fast as possible, the Soviets to
contain the Germans. We'll see how well that works.</p>

<h3 id="german-turn-1">German Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the German plans for this turn.</p>

<p>The main goal is punching through the lines in the west. That's a big
deal. If the Germans can't get through the Russian line within a couple
of turns, they have pretty well lost the game.</p>

<h4 id="replacementreinforcement-1">Replacement/reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Axis replacements are brought in according to Section 12.3 either 1.
along the black bordered western edge of the map, or 2. flip reduced
unit back to full strength given unit is in communication with black
edge.</p>

<p>No replacements yet.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase-1">Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>In the south, reposition to get good odds against mechanized in wooded
terrain.</p>

<p>In the north, reposition units to get better odds, making up for any
issue at starting placement.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-1">Combat phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may attack (10.0).</p>

<p>A bunch, from north to south:</p>

<ol>
  <li>15:3 on Soviet 15 mechanized corps, 5:1 roll 1 yields <code>DR</code>.</li>
  <li>4:1 against 9th Army, roll 3 <code>EX</code>.</li>
  <li>5:1 against 18 Mech, roll 4 yields <code>DRL</code>.</li>
  <li>2:1 against 12th Army, roll 4 yields <code>EX</code>.</li>
  <li><del>5:1 against 19th Mech, roll 1 yields <code>DR</code>.</del> No attack in
this area from Axis on Turn 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>This didn't actually go that well. No units were eliminated, and due to
the way the map is shaped it even tightened the Russian line. Dang. Low
rolls didn't help.</p>

<h4 id="axis-special-movement-phase-1">Axis Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German armor and Italian mechanized units may move their full movement
in this phase (9.4.1); infantry not in EZOC may move half movement
allowance (9.4.2).</p>

<p>Bring up the Axis units to put pressure on the Russians.</p>

<h3 id="russian-turn-1">Russian Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the Russian plan for this turn.</p>

<p>Since the Russians get a double attack strength for mechanized, the
obvious thing is to attack hard on the German front to push them back,
slow them down a turn or two.</p>

<h4 id="replacements-1">Replacements</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">See Section 12.2 of the rules, note especially that on-map Russian units
can be rebuilt even if the unit is in an EZOC. Off-board replacements
must not appear in EZOC.</p>

<h4 id="soviet-special-movement-phase-1">Soviet Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Soviet mechanized may move, along with any Soviet unit already on a rail
hex which is not in an EZOC (9.4.3).</p>

<h4 id="combat-1">Combat</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may attack (10.0).</p>

<p>48 Pz is going to get nailed, 32:10, 3:1 roll 2 for <code>DR</code>, but through
EZOC, so there will be a step loss.</p>

<h4 id="movement-1">Movement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may move (9.0).</p>

<h3 id="administrative-1">Administrative</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the game marker. Summarize the results for the turn for each
player. Were goals achieved or stymied?</p>

<p>Overall, the Soviets seemed to be more successful this turn than the
Axis, containing and even driving back a panzer division.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Summarize the situation in the upcoming turn for both players.</p>

<h3 id="german-turn-2">German Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the German plans for this turn.</p>

<p>More of Turn 1, the Germans try to break out, the Soviets contain.</p>

<h4 id="replacementreinforcement-2">Replacement/reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Axis replacements are brought in according to Section 12.3 either 1.
along the black bordered western edge of the map, or 2. flip reduced
unit back to full strength given unit is in communication with black
edge.</p>

<p>No Axis replacements or reinforcements this turn.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase-2">Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>Move into position for breaking the line, not really much movement at
all.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-2">Combat phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may attack (10.0).</p>

<ol>
  <li>3:1 roll 3 yield <code>DR</code>.</li>
  <li>5:1 roll 5 yield <code>DE</code>, finally.</li>
  <li>2:1 roll 6, <code>NE</code>.</li>
  <li>12:1 automatic <code>DE</code> for mechanized unit.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="axis-special-movement-phase-2">Axis Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German armor and Italian mechanized units may move their full movement
in this phase (9.4.1); infantry not in EZOC may move half movement
allowance (9.4.2).</p>

<p>Still cannot get through the line, will advance anyway.</p>

<h3 id="russian-turn-2">Russian Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the Russian plan for this turn.</p>

<p>Pummel Germans. Be vaguely  aware of getting flanked and cut off from
communications. Soviets are going to push the envelope here, and see
what happens.</p>

<h4 id="replacements-2">Replacements</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">See Section 12.2 of the rules, note especially that on-map Russian units
can be rebuilt even if the unit is in an EZOC. Off-board replacements
must not appear in EZOC.</p>

<p>Definitely flip an Army to full strength. Bring a second army in at
Rovno, which can move into combat via rail.</p>

<h4 id="soviet-special-movement-phase-2">Soviet Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Soviet mechanized may move, along with any Soviet unit already on a rail
hex which is not in an EZOC (9.4.3).</p>

<p>Move armies by rail and foot into EZOC for upcoming combat phase. Do not
cut the Germans any slack at all.</p>

<h4 id="combat-2">Combat</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may attack (10.0).</p>

<ol>
  <li>1:1 on giant panzer stack, 1/3 chance of <code>EX</code>, worth the risk, roll 4
yields <code>NE</code>.</li>
  <li>North of Iasi, 2:1 roll 5 <code>NE</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="movement-2">Movement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>Infantry encircles German advance, mechanized units to the east back off
so that they aren't trapped.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-2">Administrative</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the game turn marker. Summarize the results for the turn for
each player. Were goals achieved or stymied?</p>

<p>The Germans think they may be able to flank the Soviets and put them out of
communication. If they do that, then no Soviet units out of
communication can gain replacement steps. The Soviets are doing pretty
well, they have the Germans just bottled up. Every time the Soviets get
pushed back, they advance right back into combat.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Summarize the situation in the upcoming turn for both players.</p>

<p>The Germans are not going to break through, that much is clear. They may
be able to turn the flank on the Soviet line, but the Soviets will be
able to fall back to prevent that.</p>

<h3 id="german-turn-3">German Turn 3</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the German plans for this turn.</p>

<p>There is no breakthrough at this point, so the Germans are going to try
and turn the flank on the Soviets.</p>

<h4 id="replacementreinforcement-3">Replacement/reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Axis replacements are brought in according to Section 12.3 either 1.
along the black bordered western edge of the map, or 2. flip reduced
unit back to full strength given unit is in communication with black
edge.</p>

<p>Hungarian and Slovenian units enter hex 0710, will anchor the southern
flank of German advance.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase-3">Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>This is where the Germans may be able to start cutting off the Soviet
units.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-3">Combat phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may attack (10.0).</p>

<ol>
  <li>3:1 roll 1 <code>DR</code>, this Soviet Army will go full strength next turn.</li>
  <li>5:1 roll 2 <code>DRL</code> which is an elimination because all retreats are
into German EZOCs.</li>
  <li>6:1 automatic <code>DE</code> on mechanized with no retreat path. This unit
should have moved out of the area earlier, but it did delay the German
advance from the south by at least 1 turn.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="axis-special-movement-phase-3">Axis Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German armor and Italian mechanized units may move their full movement
in this phase (9.4.1); infantry not in EZOC may move half movement
allowance (9.4.2).</p>

<p>Try and sweep around from the south. It's risky, there are some strong
mech units out there.</p>

<h3 id="russian-turn-1">Russian Turn</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the Russian plan for this turn.</p>

<p>Cut off the German sweep using mechanized units to swoop in, fight, then
swoop away from counter attack.</p>

<h4 id="replacements-3">Replacements</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">See Section 12.2 of the rules, note especially that on-map Russian units
can be rebuilt even if the unit is in an EZOC. Off-board replacements
must not appear in EZOC.</p>

<ul>
  <li>38th Infantry Corps emplaces at Vinnitsa.</li>
  <li>12th flips to full strength.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="soviet-special-movement-phase-3">Soviet Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Soviet mechanized may move, along with any Soviet unit already on a rail
hex which is not in an EZOC (9.4.3).</p>

<p>12 and 38 Corps move to engage German flankers, 4 Mech moves to stack
with 38 Corps. Other, weak mech corps moving towards Kiev for defense.</p>

<h4 id="combat-3">Combat</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may attack (10.0).</p>

<p>On the flank north of Chernovsty, 2:1 roll 5 <code>NE</code>, which is containment.</p>

<h4 id="movement-3">Movement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>Turns out the line is weak in the north, moving units to help shore it
up and prevent a German breakthrough.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-3">Administrative</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the game turn marker. Summarize the results for the turn for
each player. Were goals achieved or stymied?</p>

<p>The Soviets are doing really well containing the Germans, having them
mostly pushed up against the western edge of the map. The Germans,
however, are still very strong, and won't be pushed off the map. So the
Soviets need to keep up the pressure.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Summarize the situation in the upcoming turn for both players.</p>

<p>The Germans have <em>got</em> to turn the flank this turn and get the panzers
across the map. If the Soviets can hold them for this turn, the number
of replacements and reinforcements coming in should halt the German
advance from here out.</p>

<h3 id="german-turn-4">German Turn 4</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the German plans for this turn.</p>

<p>Finally get around the south end of the Russian line. No excuses.</p>

<h4 id="replacementreinforcement-4">Replacement/reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Axis replacements are brought in according to Section 12.3 either 1.
along the black bordered western edge of the map, or 2. flip reduced
unit back to full strength given unit is in communication with black
edge.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Italians coming in at Iasi, hex 1010.</li>
  <li>Flip 48 Pz back to full strength.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="movement-phase-4">Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>Swinging around south, and taking on some units in the line which just
happen to be a good shot at retreating or eliminating.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-4">Combat phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may attack (10.0).</p>

<ol>
  <li>2:1 roll 2 <code>DR</code></li>
  <li>5:1 roll 2 <code>DRL</code></li>
  <li>2:1 roll 5 <code>NE</code></li>
  <li>4:1, this is the big one, this is the one which the Germans really
need to score on, like roll a 6, so, roll 6 for <code>DE</code>, which is what
the Germans really need!</li>
  <li>6:1 automatic <code>DE</code> on mech unit.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="axis-special-movement-phase-4">Axis Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German armor and Italian mechanized units may move their full movement
in this phase (9.4.1); infantry not in EZOC may move half movement
allowance (9.4.2).</p>

<p>Time for panzers to swoop, and they're off towards Kiev, blocked by a
lowly 2-1-6 mech unit.</p>

<h3 id="russian-turn-4">Russian Turn 4</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the Russian plan for this turn.</p>

<p>Ruh roh, the Russians stayed in the fight just a little too long, and
now have to retract their line asap.</p>

<h4 id="replacements-4">Replacements</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">See Section 12.2 of the rules, note especially that on-map Russian units
can be rebuilt even if the unit is in an EZOC. Off-board replacements
must not appear in EZOC.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Armies in at Kirovograd and Kiev.</li>
  <li>6-3-6 mech in at Uman.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="soviet-special-movement-phase-4">Soviet Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Soviet mechanized may move, along with any Soviet unit already on a rail
hex which is not in an EZOC (9.4.3).</p>

<p>Repositioning.</p>

<h4 id="combat-4">Combat</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may attack (10.0).</p>

<p>No combat this turn, need to reposition and can't afford the potential
losses.</p>

<h4 id="movement-4">Movement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>The Soviets are in a heap o' trouble. They don't have enough units on
the map to control any territory. It's all a big free for all now. In
any case, they're trying to establish a line running from the northwest
to the southeast, hopefully enclosing Kiev and staying in communication.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-4">Administrative</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the game turn marker. Summarize the results for the turn for
each player. Were goals achieved or stymied?</p>

<p>This was a big turn. The Panzers are loose, and the defense has
collapsed.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Summarize the situation in the upcoming turn for both players.</p>

<p>The Germans are going to try and cut the communication by establishing
EZOCs on the eastern red line, while the Soviets will attempt to
reestablish a line of sorts enclosing Kiev.</p>

<h3 id="german-turn-5">German Turn 5</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the German plans for this turn.</p>

<p>Keep driving east without getting distracted by worthless roadblocks
thrown up by retreating Soviets. Getting the red hex line cut off with
EZOCs is paramount. In the middle, continue to cut off Soviet forces
such that they cannot replace to regain steps.</p>

<h4 id="replacementreinforcement-5">Replacement/reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Axis replacements are brought in according to Section 12.3 either 1.
along the black bordered western edge of the map, or 2. flip reduced
unit back to full strength given unit is in communication with black
edge.</p>

<ul>
  <li>4th Infantry Corps regains full strength.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="movement-phase-5">Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>Can't get around the road blocks, have to fight. But the Soviets are on
the run, to be sure.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-5">Combat phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may attack (10.0).</p>

<ol>
  <li>6:1 mech auto <code>DE</code>.</li>
  <li>5:1 against mech outside of Kiev, roll 5, <code>DE</code></li>
  <li>3:1 on surrounded infantry army, roll 1 <code>DR</code> automatic <code>DE</code> no

  <li>2:1 Uman, roll 6 <code>NE</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="axis-special-movement-phase-5">Axis Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German armor and Italian mechanized units may move their full movement
in this phase (9.4.1); infantry not in EZOC may move half movement

<p>Primarily cut off Kiev and Kirivograd.</p>

<h2 id="russian-turn-5">Russian Turn 5</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the Russian plan for this turn.</p>

<p>Russians are in big trouble, but they do have some cities in the north,
by the Priyapits, which they can probably retain because the Germans
overshot them.</p>

<h4 id="replacements-5">Replacements</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">See Section 12.2 of the rules, note especially that on-map Russian units
can be rebuilt even if the unit is in an EZOC. Off-board replacements
must not appear in EZOC.</p>

<p>Three replacements and a reinforcement. The reinforcement will come in
at Rovno. The replacements come in at Chernigov.</p>

<h4 id="soviet-special-movement-phase-5">Soviet Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Soviet mechanized may move, along with any Soviet unit already on a rail
hex which is not in an EZOC (9.4.3).</p>

<p>Mechanized move full movement, infantry not in EZOC get half movement.</p>

<p>Strong replacement units get a crack at a Pz division, they have it
surrounded, Kiev may stand! Other units pulling north.</p>

<h4 id="combat-5">Combat</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may attack (10.0).</p>

<ol>
  <li>1:1 on 14 Pz roll 2 <code>Ex</code> and 14 Pz is out! This puts Kiev back into
communication as well.</li>
  <li>2:1 out in the west on a German infantry unit, roll 1 for <code>DR</code>
results in step loss for retreat.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="movement-5">Movement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>Hopefully the Soviets can get the line established and protect Kiev.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-5">Administrative</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the game turn marker. Summarize the results for the turn for
each player. Were goals achieved or stymied?</p>

<p>Going to be tough, but it looks like the Germans might be able to do
this. The Soviets really are in a bind at this point, because the
Germans don't care too much about losses now.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Summarize the situation in the upcoming turn for both players.</p>

<p>The Germans need to attack with fury this turn, without too much regard
for losses, as there is only this turn and the next to make it happen.
Driving the Soviets out of communication is critical, get their
replacements all bound up into a corner where they can be contained.
The Soviets for their part, have to figure out how to block the Germans
even at the cost of any units.</p>

<h3 id="german-turn-6">German Turn 6</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the German plans for this turn.</p>

<p>First, take Kiev, then Uman, then drive to the east edge and to the
to deny Soviets replacements. Combat this turn and next should be able
to defeat the Soviets in detail.</p>

<h4 id="replacementreinforcement-6">Replacement/reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Axis replacements are brought in according to Section 12.3 either 1.
along the black bordered western edge of the map, or 2. flip reduced
unit back to full strength given unit is in communication with black
edge.</p>

<p>14 Pz comes back in at Iasi, no big deal, will be back at full strength
next turn, and with 12 hexes of movement, can get anywhere necessary on
the map in two turns.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase-6">Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>Close for assault everywhere, even at 1:1 odds the 1/6 chance of
attacker step loss is worth it.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-6">Combat phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may attack (10.0).</p>

<ol>
  <li>5:1 Kiev, roll 1 <code>DR</code> cripes a lot of 1s this game.</li>
  <li>3:1 Uman, roll 1 <code>DR</code></li>
  <li>3:1 at Shepetovka, roll 2, step loss, not that helpful to me, what's
with these low rolls.</li>
  <li>2:1 roll 2 <code>DR</code> for elimination being surrounded.</li>
</ol>

<p>Germans just might do this thing.</p>

<h4 id="axis-special-movement-phase-6">Axis Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German armor and Italian mechanized units may move their full movement
in this phase (9.4.1); infantry not in EZOC may move half movement
allowance (9.4.2).</p>

<p>Everything west of Kiev is cut off. All Soviet replacements have to come in
from the northeast, same with reinforcements. Will be bloody up there.</p>

<h3 id="russian-turn-6">Russian Turn 6</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the Russian plan for this turn.</p>

<p>Reinforcements and replacements can only come in from the northeast, so
they will mob the Pz division sitting in Chernigov.</p>

<p>Northeast only, Germans have everything else cut off.</p>

<h4 id="soviet-special-movement-phase-6">Soviet Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Soviet mechanized may move, along with any Soviet unit already on a rail
hex which is not in an EZOC (9.4.3).</p>

<p>Bring the reinforcements and replacements in to Chernigov, kick out the
48 Pz division.</p>

<h4 id="combat-6">Combat</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may attack (10.0).</p>

<ol>
  <li>1:1 in the north, roll 6 for <code>AL</code>, bummer, probably lose Sarny as a
result, but it was worth the risk.</li>
  <li>1:1 at Rovno, roll 5 <code>NE</code>.</li>
  <li>2:1 at Chernigov, this roll could be the game winner for the
Soviets… roll 2 for <code>DR</code> and 48 Pz is off the board.</li>
  <li>West of Kiev, the mech units are manning up for a 2:1 roll 5 <code>NE</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="movement-6">Movement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Soviet units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>Repositioning to deny Germans attack on Sarny and Chernigov. Looking
good for a clean Soviet victory, albeit without Kiev.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-6">Administrative</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the game turn marker. Summarize the results for the turn for
each player. Were goals achieved or stymied?</p>

<p>Germans just took too long to get around the Soviet flank, doesn't look
like it's possible to reconquer Chernigov, and Sarny will be a very
tough nut.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Summarize the situation in the upcoming turn for both players.</p>

<p>Germans are going to try and get Sarny, but it looks pretty tough.
All the Soviets need to do hold fast.</p>

<h3 id="german-turn-7">German Turn 7</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the German plans for this turn.</p>

<p>All in for taking Sarny and Chernigov, and holding Kiev. Will be tough,
but doable with dice permitting.</p>

<h4 id="replacementreinforcement-7">Replacement/reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Axis replacements are brought in according to Section 12.3 either 1.
along the black bordered western edge of the map, or 2. flip reduced
unit back to full strength given unit is in communication with black
edge.</p>

<p>48 Pz comes back in at Iasi. Won't be in play this turn, but can help
defend.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase-7">Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may move (9.0).</p>

<p>Move to Chernigov with the only unit capable, the Italians!</p>

<p>Close in around Sarny. Move the Italians to Chernigov. Some infantry
into Kiev to bolster the panzer division.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-7">Combat phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">All Axis units may attack (10.0).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Chernigov, 1:1 roll 4 <code>NE</code>.</li>
  <li>Kiev 4:1 roll 4 <code>DRL</code> which is elminination for the unit.</li>
  <li>5:1 auto elim for mech unit which is EZOC'ed.</li>
  <li>6:1 for another mech unit, <code>DE</code>.</li>
  <li>Sarny west, 1:1 roll 3 <code>EX</code> works for the Germans.</li>
  <li>Sarny southwest 4:1 roll 6 <code>DE</code>.</li>
  <li>Sarny proper at 2:1 roll 1 for <code>DR</code> which works just fine. Looks like
Sarny will be in German hands.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="axis-special-movement-phase-7">Axis Special Movement phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">German armor and Italian mechanized units may move their full movement
in this phase (9.4.1); infantry not in EZOC may move half movement
allowance (9.4.2).</p>

<p>Consolidate position around Sarny, Soviets have almost no chance of
taking this back.</p>

<h3 id="russian-turn-7">Russian Turn 7</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the Russian plan for this turn.</p>

<p>Chernigov is surrounded by replacements, it's a 4:1 fight so <code>DE</code> on
defender when surrounded.</p>

<p>The only thing which matters this turn is whether the Russians can kick
3 Pz Corps out of Kiev, and they have a 1:1 odds of doing it. If they do
it, they win by limiting the Germans to 14/16 cities. If they lose, it's
a draw. The odds are 50%. I could flip a coin, but I'll roll the dice
because it has been rolling 1s all day long, and a 1 will win it for the
Soviets. So, rolling rolling rolling… 1! I should use this die for
playing PanzerBlitz. (<em>Update: this was incorrect odds, see blunder below.</em>)</p>

<p>Soviet win. But just barely.</p>

<p>Here's the situation after the Soviet replacements enter:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g5-t7-soviet-replacements.jpg" alt="Turn 7, Soviet replacements on
board" /></p>

<p>Not too bad, really.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>So the Germans lost again, but this time it was closer than I've ever
gotten to winning as the Germans. Usually, the Germans lose very badly
on the last turn. This time, it came down to a coin flip for the draw.
Had the breakout occurred one turn earlier, it might have been a German
win. Perhaps next time.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<p>Game play blunders:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The main blunder was allowing mechanized units west of Kiev at the
end of the game, as they reduced the column shift odds for across the
river attacking. This would have guaranteed to save Kiev and result in a
draw.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not getting around the Soviet line soon enough, but I think the dice
had a bit to do with that. Just couldn't roll any <code>DE</code> in the early
game, and the retreating units just got in my way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Losing 14 Pz hurt. The Germans should have waited one more turn
before going into Chernigov. They would have had a better chance of
holding it, even if they had to fight for it.</li>
  <li>The last turn Soviet offense into Kiev, as described above, is wrong.
The Raw odds are 22:12, not 26:12, the mistake coming from the 4-2-6
mech unit counted for the attack, but it's stacked so it doesn't
count. Hence the odds are 1:1 with 1L shift, so no attack possible.
The Germans retain Kiev. They likely would have lost Kirovograd
though, on a 1:1 from the mech units in the north moving south.
Tossing a die (different die) rolls a 1, so, lost. What is it with
rolling 1s this game?</li>
</ol>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
