                Erigon Valley: Philip II visits the Illyrians

              <p>My first ancients game. In fact, this may be my first pre-20th Century
              game.</p>
              
              <p>The turn sequence is unlike any other game I've played, but probably
              closest to Vietnam 1965-1975 with regard to cycling through actions from
              each side within the turn, rather than strict IGOUGO. This is going to
              take a while to digest.</p>

                    <li>SK to SK, column 7 roll 9 yields 2(4), which will rout the

                <li>Collapse and Rout (9.18, 10.15): the Macedonian SK Axiliary 1 is
              routing. Since this is a skirmisher, it is eliminated. The opposing
              Tribal 1 SK (J) advances into vacated hex and changes facing to
              acquire the flank of Macedonian HC Companian 1. This will be

              <p>This is a pretty complex, or least very different, system compared to
              all the other games in my collection. One ramification of this
              difference is I don't yet know enough one turn in to even see many
              blunders. As I progress through the game, I'm sure I'll find many.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Per 10.13, multiple units can attack a defender, and be resolved in
              one combat resolution. What I did above is attack one Macedonian with
              two separate MI Tribal units. While this may be allowed in the rules,
              it's definitely not advantageous as the attacking units will take more
              cohesion hits otherwise.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The Illyrians get -2 on TQ rolls for this scenario, which I did
              correctly at the beginning, and forget to do on the second, when
              Bardylis closed. This probably would have kept at least one of the 2 hex
              HI hoplites on the board.</p>

              <p>GBoH is a really interesting tactical system. Not so much as it is
              really different from the standard panzer pushing.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.

                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.

              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
