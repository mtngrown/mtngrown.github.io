Erigon Valley: Philip II visits the Illyrians
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 23 2015</time>
<p>My first ancients game. In fact, this may be my first pre-20th Century
game.</p>

<p>The turn sequence is unlike any other game I've played, but probably
closest to Vietnam 1965-1975 with regard to cycling through actions from
each side within the turn, rather than strict IGOUGO. This is going to
take a while to digest.</p>

<h2 id="turn-sequence">Turn Sequence</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the general plan for each faction here.</p>

<h3 id="a-leader-activation-phase">A. Leader Activation Phase</h3>

<h4 id="shock-combat-segment">2. Shock Combat Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>Here's what it looks like, with the Illyrian forces to the northwest
(tan counters), and the Macedonians to the southeast (red counters).</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/alexander/erigon/g1-setup.jpg" alt="Philip at Erigon, ready to make war" /></p>

<p>I'm very much past my current experience in wargaming here. Battle
lines!</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Outline the general plan for each faction here.</p>

<h3 id="a-leader-activation-phase-clitus">A. Leader Activation Phase: Clitus</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Leader with lowest initiative rating is activated.</p>

<p>The lowest leader initiative is either Grabos or Clitus with 4,
we'll have Clitus go first.</p>

<h3 id="b-orders-phase-1">B. Orders Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.2 defines the Orders Phase. Each Leader is allowed the number
of orders corresponding to his Initiative Rating, or may issue Line
Command if capable.</p>

<h4 id="movementmissile-segment-1">1. Movement/Missile Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">
<li>Perform one function with one unit (5.22)</li>
<li>Line commanders (4.3) may issue Move or Missile Fire.</li>
<li>Issue individual orders to activate an MCC (5.63).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Opposing units may use Orderly Withdraw (4.3), Reaction Facing (7.16-17)
and/or Reaction Fire (8.2).</p>

<p>With 4 initiative, Clitus is activating everything to his left and
closing with the Macedonians. This will put these units into Shock
Combat (7.3).</p>

<h4 id="shock-combat-segment-1">2. Shock Combat Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">
<li>Shock designation---place Shock No TQ markers (7.33); attacking
player designates units.</li>
<li>The Charge (Pre-Shock TQ check, 9.13).</li>
<li>Resolution of Leader Combat (9.14, 9.21).</li>
<li>Clash of Spears (9.15).</li>
<li>Resolve Shock Combat (9.16).</li>
<li>check for Breakthrough (9.17).</li>
<li>Check for Collapse and Rout (9.18).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>TQ check (9.13), all Illyrian pass, Hypastis 4 and Companion 1 each
take 1 hit of cohesion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personal Combat, Clitus 3 rolls 7 for 10, Philip II 5 rolls 9 for 14,
differential 4, this is a Leader Wounded -1 result for Clitus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Clash of Spears and Shock combat resolution (9.15, 9.16):
    <ul>
      <li>MI to HI, column 6 roll 7 yeilds <code>2(2)</code></li>
      <li>MI to HI, column 6 roll 0 yeilds <code>3(2)</code></li>
      <li>MI to HC, column 7 roll 5 yields <code>2(2)</code></li>
      <li>SK to SK, column 7 roll 9 yields 2(4), which will rout the
Macedonian slingers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No breakthrough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Collapse and Rout (9.18, 10.15): the Macedonian SK Axiliary 1 is
routing. Since this is a skirmisher, it is eliminated. The opposing
Tribal 1 SK (J) advances into vacated hex and changes facing to
acquire the flank of Macedonian HC Companian 1. This will be
interesting.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c-momentum-phase-or-return-to-a-1">C. Momentum Phase (or Return to A)</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The player with the currently activated leader may attempt a momentum
roll (5.3), which may be trumped by the opposing player (5.42[2])</p>

<ul>
  <li>No momentum allowed for Clitus as 1. he is Philip II's ZOC and 2. he was
in personal combat last turn (with Philip II). Return to A.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-leader-activation-phase-grabos">A. Leader Activation Phase: Grabos</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Leader with lowest initiative rating is activated (5.1).</p>

<h3 id="b-orders-phase-2">B. Orders Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.2 defines the Orders Phase. Each Leader is allowed the number
of orders corresponding to his Initiative Rating, or may issue Line
Command if capable.</p>

<h4 id="movementmissile-segment-2">1. Movement/Missile Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">
<li>Perform one function with one unit (5.22)</li>
<li>Line commanders (4.3) may issue Move or Missile Fire.</li>
<li>Issue individual orders to activate an MCC (5.63).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Opposing units may use Orderly Withdraw (4.3), Reaction Facing (7.16-17)
and/or Reaction Fire (8.2).</p>

<p>Grabos moves his line up to face the Macedonians; no combat.</p>

<h3 id="a-leader-activation-phase-premnion">A. Leader Activation Phase: Premnion</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Leader with lowest initiative rating is activated (5.1).</p>

<p>Premnion is next, and he needs to move off the phalanx he's sitting on
right now and handle Grabos who is attempting to flank. Not sure how the
leaders are allowed to move.</p>

<h3 id="b-orders-phase-3">B. Orders Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.2 defines the Orders Phase. Each Leader is allowed the number
of orders corresponding to his Initiative Rating, or may issue Line
Command if capable.</p>

<p>Premnion gets to issue 5 orders. One for himself to move off the
phalanx, then 4 more to move some mercenaries into shock with Grabos
advancing force. The auxiliary unit on the far west will not yet move.</p>

<h4 id="movementmissile-segment-3">1. Movement/Missile Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">
<li>Perform one function with one unit (5.22)</li>
<li>Line commanders (4.3) may issue Move or Missile Fire.</li>
<li>Issue individual orders to activate an MCC (5.63).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Opposing units may use Orderly Withdraw (4.3), Reaction Facing (7.16-17)
and/or Reaction Fire (8.2).</p>

<p>As noted above, Premnion moves to Merc 4 and moves 4 of the peltast (LP) ranks
forward. These are now closed with the Tribal LI ranks.</p>

<p>The question now is "Shock, or no Shock?"</p>

<p>We'll choose Shock according to Section 7.3.</p>

<h4 id="shock-combat-segment-2">2. Shock Combat Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">
<li>Shock designation---place Shock No TQ markers (7.33); attacking
player designates units.</li>
<li>The Charge (Pre-Shock TQ check, 9.13).</li>
<li>Resolution of Leader Combat (9.14, 9.21).</li>
<li>Clash of Spears (9.15).</li>
<li>Resolve Shock Combat (9.16).</li>
<li>Push of Shields---Check for Breakthrough (9.17).</li>
<li>Check for Collapse and Rout (9.18).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The charge: units attacking and the defenders must undergo Shock TQ
check. Shocks rolls really good for both sides, only one tribal unit
accrued a single cohesion hit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resolution of leader combat: Grabos and Premnion are not adjacent in
shock combat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Clash of Spears:
    <ul>
      <li>3 LP to LI, use Column 7.</li>
      <li>1 LP to LC, use Column 8.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Shock combat resolution (9.16):
    <ol>
      <li>LP to LI: roll 9, 2(3).</li>
      <li>LP to LI, Premnion attacking: roll 2 + 2 charisma for 4, 2(2).</li>
      <li>Merc 1 takes on an LI with Grabos defending, roll 5 - 2 for 3,
2(2).</li>
      <li>Merc 2 LI to Tribal LC, roll 9 on col. 8 for 2(4).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Push of sheilds, 9.17: Tribal 2 has 6 cohesion hits, which is 3 times
the 2 cohesion hits of its opponent, so it gets another 2 hits for a
total of 8.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The collapse [trope]. Tribal 2 has to rout, see 10.2. It's probably
heading off the map, not sure it's worth Grabos trying to Rally it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c-momentum-phase-or-return-to-a-2">C. Momentum Phase (or Return to A)</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The player with the currently activated leader may attempt a momentum
roll (5.3), which may be trumped by the opposing player (5.42[2])</p>

<p>No momentum as Premion is in an EZOC.</p>

<h3 id="a-leader-activation-phase-bardylis">A. Leader Activation Phase: Bardylis</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Leader with lowest initiative rating is activated (5.1).</p>

<p>Bardylis' initiayive is tied at 6 with Philip II, as the non-Macedonian,
he gets the initiative, and he's going to charge with the hoplites.</p>

<h3 id="b-orders-phase-4">B. Orders Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.2 defines the Orders Phase. Each Leader is allowed the number
of orders corresponding to his Initiative Rating, or may issue Line
Command if capable.</p>

<p>Bardylis moves himself for 1, 3 hoplites for 4, and two MI for 6,
straight into the Macedonian phalanxes. Can anything good come of this?
Will the dice love Bardylis? Let's roll and find out.</p>

<h4 id="movementmissile-segment-4">1. Movement/Missile Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">
<li>Perform one function with one unit (5.22)</li>
<li>Line commanders (4.3) may issue Move or Missile Fire.</li>
<li>Issue individual orders to activate an MCC (5.63).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Opposing units may use Orderly Withdraw (4.3), Reaction Facing (7.16-17)
and/or Reaction Fire (8.2).</p>

<h4 id="shock-combat-segment-3">2. Shock Combat Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">
<li>Shock designation---place Shock No TQ markers (7.33); attacking
player designates units.</li>
<li>The Charge (Pre-Shock TQ check, 9.13).</li>
<li>Resolution of Leader Combat (9.14, 9.21).</li>
<li>Clash of Spears (9.15).</li>
<li>Resolve Shock Combat (9.16).</li>
<li>Push of Shields---Check for Breakthrough (9.17).</li>
<li>Check for Collapse and Rout (9.18).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All ranks subject to TQ check on shock.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The charge: All but one of the Macedonians passed shock, however,
the one resulted in 3 cohesion hits. Bummer. On the other hand, the
Tribal side got loads of cohesion hits, this risks some serious
routing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leader resolution: no leaders adjacent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Clash of spears:
    <ul>
      <li>HI/HI is col. 7.</li>
      <li>HI/PH col. 6.</li>
      <li>MI/PH col. 5.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Shock resolution:
    <ol>
      <li>Tribal 2 to Hypast 3 (with Philip II), col. 7 roll 4 - 3 for 1
yields 3(2).</li>
      <li>Tribal 1 to Mixed 3, col. 6 roll 4 yields 2(2)</li>
      <li>Tribal 3 to Mixed 4, col. 6 roll 7 yields 2(2)</li>
      <li>Tribal 3 to Mixed 2, col. 6 roll 8 yields 2(3)</li>
      <li>Tribal 10 to Mixed 5, col. 5 roll 4, 3(2)</li>
      <li>Tribal 1 to Mixed 5, col. 5 roll 8, 2(2)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Note: for combats 5 &amp; 6, these should have been on col. 4 to account
for unit size difference, as the tribal units are attacking at
essentially 1-2 odds. This produces a 1L on the columns table. In this
case, the results are the same for these rolls for columns 4 and 5.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Push of shields: doesn't apply here, the only unit it would matter for
(Tribal 3) is already going to rout. Apply Section 10.2 to Tribal 1
HI, Tribal 3 HI and Tribal 1 MI. Per 9.13, Tribal 1 HI rolls a 0 on
the d10, hence, stands in place with cohesion hits at 4.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c-momentum-phase-or-return-to-a-3">C. Momentum Phase (or Return to A)</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The player with the currently activated leader may attempt a momentum
roll (5.3), which may be trumped by the opposing player (5.42[2])</p>

<p>No momentum roll for Bardylis.</p>

<h3 id="a-leader-activation-phase-philip-ii">A. Leader Activation Phase: Philip II</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Leader with lowest initiative rating is activated (5.1).</p>

<p>This will be last leader activation for Turn 1.</p>

<h3 id="b-orders-phase-5">B. Orders Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.2 defines the Orders Phase. Each Leader is allowed the number
of orders corresponding to his Initiative Rating, or may issue Line
Command if capable.</p>

<p>Philip issues 2 move orders, 1 for himself to move to Mixe 2 PH, the
other to move Auxiliary 2 up to the line. He then issues 4 fire orders,
3 for attacking the HI hoplites, the remaining to attack Tribal 10.</p>

<h4 id="movementmissile-segment-5">1. Movement/Missile Segment</h4>

  <li>Shock resolution:
    <ol>
      <li>Hypastus 3 and Mixed 3 against Tribal 2, this is going to be a 1R
for attacker at 1.6:1 for size differential. Roll 3 yields 2(2),
which will put the defender into route.</li>
      <li>Mixed PH 4 against Tribal hoplite 1, roll 6 on col. 9 yeilds 2(3),
defender into rout condition.</li>
      <li>Mixed PH 2 against Tribal 10 MI, 2:1 for size shifts 1R, so, col.
11, roll 0 + 3 for Philip in the battle yields 2(3), which puts
both units into a rout condition.</li>

<p>The Illyrians get the first initiative, but it's not very clear what

  </li>

<p>No momentum, Grabos fought.</p>

<h3 id="a-leader-activation-phase-clitus-1">A. Leader Activation Phase: Clitus</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Leader with lowest initiative rating is activated (5.1).</p>

<p>Another Illyrian with low initiative, but might have enough mojo to get
a rout from the Macedonians.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.2 defines the Orders Phase. Each Leader is allowed the number
of orders corresponding to his Initiative Rating, or may issue Line

<p>Clitus is going to bring up some of the "reserve" to pound on a phalanx,
and fight in place on another.</p>

<h4 id="movementmissile-segment-7">1. Movement/Missile Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">

<ul>
  <li>Tribal 8 and 9 move to confront Mixed 4 PH. This is almost surely
going to rout the Macedonian, will be curious whether Philip will
attempt to rally it.</li>
  <li>Clitus is wounded -1, hence takes the third order to move to join the
shock attack on the PH.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="shock-combat-segment-6">2. Shock Combat Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The charge: Illyrians pass TQ, the PH does not, adding 3 cohesion hits
for 7 total. This induces an immediate rout check: roll 4 + 1 for
excess + 3 is 8, they rout, and the Illyrians advance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As it turns out, after advancing, there is no more for Clitus to do this
turn.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">The player with the currently activated leader may attempt a momentum

<h3 id="a-leader-activation-phase-premenion">A. Leader Activation Phase: Premenion</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Leader with lowest initiative rating is activated (5.1).</p>

<p>Premenion is in a bit of a pickle. He's about to lose several units
unless he rallies or recovers them, but that means he loses the shock
value of the attack for the rest of the turn. But that's probably better
than losing the units.</p>

<h3 id="b-orders-phase-8">B. Orders Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.2 defines the Orders Phase. Each Leader is allowed the number
of orders corresponding to his Initiative Rating, or may issue Line
Command if capable.</p>

<p>Premenion move to get into rally range of routing PH, and will attempt
to rally Merc 2, roll 5 less than 5 + 1, PH rallies with 2 cohesion
hits. Merc 2 fails rally with roll 9. These dudes are lost, they'll be
off the map next turn. That's 3 orders for Premenion.</p>

<h4 id="movementmissile-segment-8">1. Movement/Missile Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">

<p class="turn-sequence">Opposing units may use Orderly Withdraw (4.3), Reaction Facing (7.16-17)

<p>With 2 orders left, Premenion takes Merc 7 into the flank of Tribal 4,
which will induce TQ shock. Merc 4 joins the fight as the final order.</p>

<h4 id="shock-combat-segment-7">2. Shock Combat Segment</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin" class="turn-sequence">

<p>Shock markers down…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The charge: Merc 7 rolls 0, Tribal 4 roll 2, both pass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No leader combat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clash of spears: LP to MI, flanking is col. 9 with 2:1 for size.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p>And that's it for Premenion this turn.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">The player with the currently activated leader may attempt a momentum

<h3 id="a-leader-activation-phase-bardylis-1">A. Leader Activation Phase: Bardylis</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Leader with lowest initiative rating is activated (5.1).</p>

<p>Bardylis has no choice other than to be as aggressive as possible.
Although it probably won't matter as Philip will be able to rally (77%
chance) any routed phalanxes.</p>

<h3 id="b-orders-phase-9">B. Orders Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.2 defines the Orders Phase. Each Leader is allowed the number

Command if capable.</p>

<p>First, move remaining tribal to flank Macedonian Merc, then move himself
to get out of the way of Philip, and move Clitus and another unit up to
the turned around phalanx. This was a blunder on Premenion's part: this
phalanx could have been reversed for 3 MP, then closed for shock with
the units it's suffering from right now.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">The player with the currently activated leader may attempt a momentum
roll (5.3), which may be trumped by the opposing player (5.42[2])</p>

<p>Bardylis will attempt a momentum roll…rolls 8, loses momentum!
The Illyrians have had really crappy die rolls this game.</p>

<h3 id="a-leader-activation-phase-philip-ii-1">A. Leader Activation Phase: Philip II</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Leader with lowest initiative rating is activated (5.1).</p>

<p>Philip can turn the game into a real bore for the Illyrians by simply
rallying every unit which currently routing, and recovering all the
other units which are in contact and subject to shock combat. He and
Premenion can do this more or less indefinitely.</p>

<h3 id="b-orders-phase-10">B. Orders Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.2 defines the Orders Phase. Each Leader is allowed the number
of orders corresponding to his Initiative Rating, or may issue Line

<p>First order, rally Mixed 4 PH, which succeeds.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Opposing units may use Orderly Withdraw (4.3), Reaction Facing (7.16-17)

<p>After the rally, which can be done without Philip moving, it's time to
move him and attempt rally on a couple of other units:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Merc 4: roll 2, rallied with 1 cohesion hit.</li>
  <li>Merc 2: roll 4, rallied with 1 cohesion hit.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's 4, recover Merc 1 &amp; 3, and the Macedonians have basically
suffered no casualties to speak of, while the Illyrians are just
hammered.</p>

  <li>Reload eligible missile units (8.18).</li>
  <li>Flip all "moved" and "finished" counters to front side.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="e-withdrawal-phase-2">E. Withdrawal Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Total rout points for each side. If one side routs, they withdraw as the
loser, otherwise proceed to the next turn.</p>

<p>The Illyrians are going to concede. They've learned a bit more about how
to fight the Macedonians, and will retire now to fight again another
day.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-2">End of Turn 2</h3>

<p>Here's the situation at the end of Turn 2:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/alexander/erigon/g1_t2.jpg" alt="Illyrians are really hurting after second turn" /></p>

<p>Ugly business.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The Macedonians rolled a lot of 0s on TQ checks. That sucks as their
units are almost all better in every way in any case.</p>

<p>The Illyrians have more initiative points, but less range, and overall
less TQ for roughly even forces. The biggest lesson learned here is not
to blindly charge into Macedonian phalanxes (or hypaspists). Figure out
a smarter way to battle Philip II.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<p>This is a pretty complex, or least very different, system compared to
all the other games in my collection. One ramification of this
difference is I don't yet know enough one turn in to even see many
blunders. As I progress through the game, I'm sure I'll find many.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Per 10.13, multiple units can attack a defender, and be resolved in
one combat resolution. What I did above is attack one Macedonian with
two separate MI Tribal units. While this may be allowed in the rules,
it's definitely not advantageous as the attacking units will take more
cohesion hits otherwise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Illyrians get -2 on TQ rolls for this scenario, which I did
correctly at the beginning, and forget to do on the second, when
Bardylis closed. This probably would have kept at least one of the 2 hex
HI hoplites on the board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Movement induces a cohesion hit of 1 in most units, per 6.13. I didn't
do this until half way into Turn 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not using the result multiplier for Position Superiority. I didn't do
this for either side, so it probably balanced out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not checking rout on units with cohesion TQ - 1 during <em>Push of
Shields</em>. This may not have mattered as it comes into play with units
remaining in EZOC, but it probably could have helped the Illyrians.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>

<p>GBoH is a really interesting tactical system. Not so much as it is
really different from the standard panzer pushing. This first scenario
was on the table about a month, with the first two shock combats
stalling everything out. Once I figured out the system, and how to write
it up in this play-by-play, everything went a lot faster. I knocked out
the rest of it over the course of a few days.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
