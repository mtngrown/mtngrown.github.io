                Operation SEALORDS, and the game
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 13 2015</time>
              <p>I've got a game of <em>SEALORDS: The Vietnam War in the Mekong Delta</em>
              scheduled tomorrow with AS at EGO. Over the last few days I've been
              setting up the small scenario modeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Game_Warden">Operation Game
              Warden</a>.</p>
              
              <p>But first, a bit about <strong>SEALORDS</strong>, the <strong>S</strong>outh<strong>E</strong>ast <strong>A</strong>sia
              <strong>L</strong>and <strong>O</strong>cean <strong>R</strong>iverine <strong>D</strong>elta <strong>S</strong>trategy, which has to be
              the most acronym ever. The driving motivation behind SEALORDS was to
              deny the VC logistical support and bases for VC forces operating in the
              Mekong Delta region southwest of Saigon. The Delta is pretty close to
              Saigon, on the order of 10s of miles, which allowed the VC to get in
              very close. The Delta is characterized by the Mekong River (of course),
              along with a network of naturally developed distributary waterways, and
              man-made canals connecting everything with everything. Land movement is
              very difficult in the Mekong Delta, and prohibited in the game.  Moving
              forces requires water craft or air craft, both of which the US could
              supply in abundance. As a result of various operations as part of
              SEALORDS, the VC were largely driven away from operating in the Mekong
              Delta.</p>

              <p>VC move a leg Bn and HQ on an Unarmed Light Craft (ULC) from Cambodia to

                <li>VC brings 8 but 1L for SF base in Tan Chau. Roll 2 on the 6-7 column
              for <code>A</code> sends the airstrike back to the refit box. FWA on the 2 column
              roll 5 for <code>R</code> which is refit, the VC elect to refit the HQ unit.
              Round 2: FWA has the bounce, attack on the 2 column roll 2 for <code>A</code>
              which is inapplicable against VC; VC roll 6 on the 3 column (shift 1L
              for SF base, 1L for town defense) which is <code>K</code> and 4 VP for VC.</li>

              <p>Attack at Soc Trang, whoops, we have civilians, local infantry and a
              Deception marker in play. This is gonna be dicey for the FWA. Cost of
              operation is 1, movement of SEAL team company, 1. That Civilian marker
              is 2 VP for the VC. Looks like the Deception marker is equivalent to a
              dummy counter. Roll for the bounce, to the VC. FWA bringing in airmobile
              unit, another SEAL team, cost another 1 CP (at least). Combat: VC roll
              <code>2</code> which is no effect as no airstrike markers are used in this round.
              FWA roll 6, which is column 8-9 for 11 strength and town defense and
              results in <code>K+B</code>. Since the Deception unit is not in play, that leaves
              the Local Force as the <code>K</code> and 2 VP for the FWA.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
