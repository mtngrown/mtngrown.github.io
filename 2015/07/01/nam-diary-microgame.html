<p>'Nam Diary is a tiny game on 5x8 map with a few counters on each side,
US and NVA. The mechanics are very simple, as one might expect from the
size: players alternate either moving or firing units located in a
single hex. While the US player goes first, the initiative can change to
have the NVA player first, then again switch back to US player. This
means in game play turns, each side has the possibility of multiple
moves and fires in a single turn.</p>

<p>The initiative check after each very short turn builds in a fair bit of
randomness into the game play. Victory conditions are also determined
randomly via chit pull (1-6). From just reading the rules, it feels like
there is a quite a bit of replay value in this game. It might be
something I could play in the evenings on my way home from work once in
a while.</p>

<p>So let's get started with drawing the victory conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The US pulls a 6, which means it needs to render 2/3 NVA KIA.
For 11 NVA this mean 8. So, stand and fight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The NVA draw a 5, which is KIA 2/3 of the US forces, i.e., 5 US KIA.
Again, stand and fight.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Normally, these victory conditions would be hidden from the other
player, but that's not really possible in this first solo game.</p>

<p>The turn sequence is very simple:</p>

<ol>
  <li>US moves or fires.</li>
  <li>NVA moves or fires.</li>
  <li>Roll for initiative.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's get started, and see how it plays out.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Here's a snapshot of a first US turn:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/nam-diary/g1-start.jpg" alt="Getting started with 'Nam Diary" /></p>

<p>Right away we can see that the NVA set up within range of US, that's a
blunder. Much better to have forced the US to move first, which would
put them in range to be fired on.</p>

<p>That's Grunt on the table in the background, it's next up on my to-play
list.</p>

<p>The NVA just make a move, but into range to be fired on.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 3 for <em>no US or NVA units are unpinned</em>, in other words
no effect.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>US moves a stack towards pinned NVA from Turn 1.</p>

<p>NVA fires on US stack which just moved, miss.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 1, NVA player goes again, chooses to fire on Bennet,
roll 5 hit, roll 6 KIA.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>US fires on NVA 9, which is pinned, roll 4 hits, roll 1 pinned.</p>

<p>NVA moves.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 1, NVA moves again.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>US (Johnson and McKay) fire again on pinned NVA 9, roll 5/3, still
pinned. These guys could consider moving since they won't be taking fire
from NVA 9.</p>

<p>NVA continues to close. It's going to start getting bloody in a couple
of turns.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 1 (this is getting boring), NVA moves again, continues
to close up.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>Oops, blunder, range is 3, with a -1 DRM at range 3. That's good enough.</p>

<p>US starts to unstack.</p>

<p>NVA 4 chooses to fire, will need a 6 to hit, roll 3/6, miss.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 2 <em>all units unpinned, turn sequence reversed</em>.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>NVA 9 fires on Johnson and McKay, roll 6/2, both pinned.</p>

<p>US (Williams) fires on NVA 3, roll 4/1 pinned.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 3 no effect.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p>NVA moves toward McKay and Johson.</p>

<p>US (Henry and Bailey) fire on NVA, both need 6 to hit at range 3, but
have uncovered another fake. Bailey roll 2/3 miss, Henry roll 1/1 miss.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 4 <em>all units are unpinned, US goes again</em>. Williams
fires on NVA 3, needs 4 to hit, roll 1/5. US is not rolling well this
game.</p>

<h2 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h2>

<p>NVA 2 fires on McKay and Johnson. Watch these guys get boxcars or
something…roll 4/2 miss.</p>

<p>McKay and Johnson return fire on NVA 2, and this is where I made a
blunder before, only making one fire out of hex with two soldiers.
McKay rolls 4/4, pinned, Johnson rolls 4/2 no effect.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 2, <em>all units unpinned, turn sequence reversed</em>.</p>

<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/nam-diary/g1-t8.jpg" alt="End of Turn 8" /></p>

<p>So far, lots of pins and misses, but as everyone closes, will get a lot
bloodier.</p>

<h2 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h2>

<p>US is back to going first in the turn, which is like having a double
turn sort of. McKay and Johnson both fire on NVA 9. McKay rolls 4/6,
KIA.</p>

<p>NVA 3 fires on Willams, rolls 4/3, pinned.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 3 no effect.</p>

<h2 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h2>

<p>US Johnson and McKay fire on NVA 2, McKay rolls 2/4, Johnson rolls 6/1,
pinned.</p>

<p>NVA moves.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 3 no effect.</p>

<h2 id="turn-11">Turn 11</h2>

<p>Harwood fires on NVA 11 &amp; 13, roll 2/1, miss.</p>

<p>NVA 11 &amp; 13 fire on Harwood, roll 3/2, 3/5, miss.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 3 no effect. Dang.</p>

<h2 id="turn-12">Turn 12</h2>

<p>Harwood fires again…roll 5/5 KIA on NVA 11 and 13.</p>

<p>NVA 3 fires on Williams rolls 5/5 KIA.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 3 no effect.</p>

<h2 id="turn-13">Turn 13</h2>

<p>McKay and Johnson fire on NVA 7, roll 2/5, 4/1, remains pinned.</p>

<p>NVA moves.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 6, unpin NVA, US goes again, McKay and Johnson fire
again: McKay rolls 4/6, KIA for NVA 7.</p>

<h2 id="turn-14">Turn 14</h2>

<p>Henry and Bailey fire on NVA 3 &amp; 6, roll 2/2, 4/6 KIA.</p>

<p><em>Blunder here</em> all units must roll individually for casualty, a KIA or a
Pin affects only one unit. This would could put 3 NVA back on the
board…roll 1, 3 and 6 puts one back on the board, which is going to stack
with another unit to increase fire on next US target.</p>

<p>NVA 2 &amp; 5 fire on Henry and Bailey, roll 2/4 miss, roll 1/6 miss.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 5 <em>US units with leader unpinned, all NVA unpinned</em>.</p>

<h2 id="turn-15">Turn 15</h2>

<p>Bailey and Henry fire on NVA 2 &amp; 5, roll 1/5 miss, roll 5/3,1 pin both.</p>

<p>NVA moves.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 6 <em>all NVA unpinned, US goes again</em>, Bailey and Henry
fire: Bailey misses, Henry hits with 4, 1,3 on casualty, back to being
pinned for these guys.</p>

<h2 id="turn-16">Turn 16</h2>

<p>Harwood fires on NVA 8 &amp; 10, roll 3/1,1 total whiff.</p>

<p>NVA 8 &amp; 10 fire on Harwood, roll 5/1, pinned.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 1 <em>all US unpinned, NVA goes again</em> NVA 8 &amp; 10 fire on
Harwood, roll 2/5, roll 4/6 which is a miss, NVA is not as accurate as
US. Bummer for them.</p>

<h2 id="turn-17">Turn 17</h2>

<p>Repeat for Harwood, roll 4/4,5 which is a KIA/Pin.</p>

<p>NVA 4 moves on Harwood.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 1 NVA 4 fires on Harwood, need some lucky rolls
here…6/4 and Harwood is pinned.</p>

<h2 id="turn-18">Turn 18</h2>

<p>Henry and Bailey fire on NVA 2 &amp; 5, Henry 5/3, no change from Pin,
Bailey 2/2, no effect.</p>

<p>NVA 6 fires on Henry and Bailey, a little luck here would be nice, roll
5/4, Henry is pinned, Bailey is pinned.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 3 no effect.</p>

<h2 id="turn-19">Turn 19</h2>

<p>Harwood fires on NVA 4, roll 3/2 no effect.</p>

<p>NVA 3 fires on Harwood, roll 5/6, KIA Harwood. NVA need 2 more KIA for
win.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 1, <em>all US unpinned, NVA goes again</em> NVA 3 on McKay and
Johnson, roll 4, miss.</p>

<h2 id="turn-20">Turn 20</h2>

<p>Mckay and Johnson on NVA 6, Mckay rolls 3/3 for a miss, Johnson rolls
boxcars for KIA.</p>

<p>NVA 2 fires on McKay and Johnson, roll 4/3 miss.</p>

<p>Initiative roll 6 <em>all NVA unpinned, US goes again</em> Henry and Bailey on
NVA 2 &amp; 5, Henry rolls 5/6 for 1 KIA, and another 6 for another KIA.</p>

<p>That makes 8 NVA for a US win.</p>

<p>Here's what the end of the game looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/nam-diary/g1-t20.jpg" alt="Turn 20 and US victory" /></p>

<p>Overall, a nice hour's diversion.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Given that both sides had KIA for victory conditions turned this more
into a dice-driven slugfest than a game where maneuver mattered much.
The US definitely got the better rolls. In a two player game where the
victory conditions were hidden, I suspect the NVA would have a better
chance by attempting to sucker the US into playing differently. Hard to
say on the basis of one game, solo.</p>

<p>I've just decided I'm on a long term hunt for a small game or two which
can travel, which is hex and counter, which has a very small footprint,
which plays in 15-20 minutes, and which is fun. It should not be too
small, because that makes it hard to play, and not too big so that it's
hard to travel. 'Nam Diary comes pretty close in a lot of ways. I'm
definitely going to play it several more times, hopefully with
opponents, and see if it fills this hole, even partially.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
