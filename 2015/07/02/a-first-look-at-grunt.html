                A first look at Grunt
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  2 2015</time>
              <p>One of the earliest Vietnam games I know of is SPI's <em>Grunt</em> (1971),
              which simulate very small unit operations during the Vietnam War.  By
              "small" I mean company level operations with squads as the fire and
              maneuver elements. One can certainly simulate at even lower levels, but
              it would seem odd to me to task a single platoon for an operation.
              Platoons just don't have enough support.</p>
              
              <p>The rules for Grunt are not the easiest to assimilate, in part because
              the game is as much a small "game system" as it is any single game. The
              following situations or scenarios are very briefly described in the
              rules:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Solo game.</li>
                <li>Basic two player game.</li>
                <li>Standard two player game.</li>
                <li>Chain of Command Situation 1: Search and Destroy.</li>
                <li>Chain of Command Situation 2: Secure Landing Zone.</li>
                <li>Chain of Command Situation 3: Eagle Flight.</li>
                <li>Roll your own situation given appropriate orders of battle and command orders
              as outlined in the Chain of Command situations.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Along with these situations, the NLF have the following order of battle
              options: Basic Game, Mobile Base Camp, Mobile Training Camp, Day-to-Day,
              Supply Depot, Inf. Company, NLF Held Area.</p>
              
              <p>Accompanying the situations and orders of battle, there are also a long
              list of optional rules covering Strengthened Defense, Move &amp; Fire,
              Ammunition and Supply, Reconnaissance-by-fire, Casualty Combat Results
              (with associated medics), Ambush, Artillery, Forward Observation, Fire
              Effects, Fields of Fire, Airstrikes and more.</p>
              
              <p>There's quite a bit of game play here, since (apparently) the Chain of
              Command orders, optional rules and NLF order of battles can be mixed and
              matched. Balance is achieved via handicapping. For example, landing an
              entire company at once gives the NLF player 75 victory points. The US
              going into an NLF Held Area gives the US player 100 victory points.</p>
              
              <p>However, it should be noted, the rules are not that clear, and are not
              what would be considered well-organized 45 years after publication.
              Hence, it's not altogether clear how to put together a viable solitaire
              situation. We'll have to let common sense rule the day.</p>
              
              <h2 id="game-play-overview">Game play overview</h2>
              
              <p>Fundamentally, <em>Grunt</em> is an IGOUGO system, with one player having
              exposing units only when firing or fired upon. The US player is brought
              in by abstract helicopters, which may be shot down by NLF as a reaction
              when US forces land. The optional rules provide a lot of chrome, but
              nothing unduly difficult. Games should play pretty fast, the biggest
              holdup being the NLF player being able to remember his deployment or
              check units quickly. At least one person made blocks for NLF for
              convenience. Counter sleds might work, albeit those are hard to stack.</p>

              <hr />
              
              <p>This turn sequence is deceptively simple. Where more modern games break
              out actions such as supply and air actions, these activities are buried
              in one of the phases, and the player has to work out the appropriate
              sequencing. From the rules, such activities aren't complicated, but care
              needs to be taken to keep track.</p>
              
              <h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>
              
              <p>The solitaire game has us set up all the NLF, Peasants and Dummy
              counters on the board, face down. We're going to use the Basic Rules and
              Basic Game US deployment, which is 12 squads and a company commander.
              The US forces in Grunt consist of a two company battalion. We'll use
              A Company without the platoon leaders (i.e., the platoon leader counters
              won't go on the map).</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p>The NLF is already on the map, the US needs to land some forces. The US
              goal is to clear a lane across the map to control access across the
              central open area dividing the western forks of the river.</p>

              <p>As can be seen from the situation at the end of Turn 5, the US is at a
              bit of an impasse with respect to the rules for solitaire play. Since
              half of two platoons are restricted from moving until the NLF units are
              eliminated, and it takes a 6 on 4:1 column to eliminate, the game is
              pretty much of a lock for the US at the moment. The NLF will have to
              have to get lucky trading shots back and forth to run up the score on
              their behalf. Let's see what happens trading fire with these units as
              1st platoon moves into the treeline to the west.</p>

              <p>Despite the somewhat boringness of the solitaire rules, I think I rather
              like the system. It's simple, should play pretty fast with two player
              who know the rules, and there is enough optional what-would-now-be-called
              "chrome" to keep it interesting.</p>
              
              <p>Given the reliance on hidden units and bluffing, it would be a bit of
              work to drive out a decent solitaire system. But it could probably be
              done. Not sure it's worth it other than an exercise in design.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
