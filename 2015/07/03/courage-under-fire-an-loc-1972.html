Courage Under Fire - An Loc 1972
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  3 2015</time>
<p>I'm putting this game out for a couple of reasons. First, I'm sort of
avoiding getting sucked into Grunt, which has the map already under
plexi, but due to a rules reading last night, turns out to be a bit more
involved than what I was expecting. Which isn't really a problem, but I
do like to have a mix of games in play, from longer to shorter.
Sometimes, it's nice to just finish something. Second, HFD Games
publishes a number of small, relatively fast-playing area movement
Vietnam games, and this will be the first one I've played. Seems like a
perfect interlude between the just finished <a href="/2015/05/23/erigon-valley-philip-ii-visits-the-illyrians.html">GBoH
Alexander</a>
and the upcoming Grunt.</p>

<p>So, the plan is to work through Courage Under Fire, while getting Grunt
set up for the next play by sorting OOB and continuing to read the
rules.</p>

<p>With that in mind, let's start by describing the turn sequence for
Courage Under Fire. The basic mechanic is chit pull, with an ordinary
deck of playing cards serving as chits (or a custom small size deck
which can be optionally purchased). A red card allows the NVA to
activate, a black card the ARVN. This is more of a loop than a strict
sequence of play:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Card Draw (CD): Red for NVA initiative, black for ARVN initiative.
  Joker ends the turn.</li>
  <li>Player with initiative may activate 1/2 the number of units given on
  the drawn card (or same number with custom cards). Activated units may
  either:
    <ol>
      <li>Move 1 area (2 if AFV), or</li>
      <li>Fire.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's what my first game set up looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/courage-under-fire/g1-start.jpg" alt="Courage Under Fire" /></p>

<p>The first card is an NVA card. The die indicates the roll for NVA first
turn exception, which in this case indicates 2, less than the 3 which
the card would have allowed to be activated.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 3: NVA has initiative, DR exception for first turn roll 2 activations, will
move units to combine an attack next initiative if possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw  red 4: NVA moves 4 units into Area 6.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 4: NVA is getting lucky, all of the NVA in Area 6 are going
to fire on 5th ARVN 2/8. Draw card value 4, -3 for ARVN DF,
-1 for Area 6, + 11 for Fire Strength of attacking NVA. Since 11 &gt;
3, ARVN 5/8 is reduced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 3: NVA keeps on firing, turns out the Sapper unit doesn't
need to be activated to be used, so the FS is still 11. Draw 1,
figure 1 - 1 - 2 + 11 = 9 &gt; 3, 5/8 is eliminated. Move ARVN
resistance level to 8.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 3: ARVN from Areas 9, 10 &amp; 11 attack armor in Area 6. Draw
black 1 doubled to 2 for same side, hence 2 -1 - 2 + 5 = 4 &gt; 2, NVA
1/202 is reduced. ARVN uses an airstrike on the reduced 1/202, roll 8 no
effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw Joker, Game Turn Ends. No surrender roll because not enough ARVN
eliminated to trigger it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, this actually went a lot faster than I thought it would. The system
is actually pretty smooth. Far too early to tell whether the game
overall works. The game weight feels like it's coming in at one step
above 'Nam Diary. So maybe not strictly a "filler" game, but something
which could be played when time is too tight for anything heavier.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>NVA/VC artillery roll 2.</li>
  <li>ARVN air strike roll 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some pretty lame rolls for both. Will make it easier to play though.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 3: NVA attacking into Area 6, draw red 3, hence 6 - 1 - 3 +
8 = 10 &gt; 3, ARVN 1/8 reduced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 4: attack armor in Area 6, draw black 3 hence 6 - 1 - 1 +
4 (ARVN FS) + 1 (ARVN artillery) = 9 &gt; 1, NVA 1/202 eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 3: NVA attack Area 9 from Area 6, draw black 4 - 1 - 2 + 8 =
9 &gt; 2, 1/8 eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 4: ARVN airborne dropping in to Areas 10 &amp; 11.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 3: ARVN airborne from 10 &amp; 11 attacking Sappers in Area 6,
draw black 2 for 4 - 1 - 3 + 9 = 9 &gt; 3, sappers reduced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 2: air strike on sappers in Area 6 roll 1 &lt; 6, sappers
reduced again, hence eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 5: NVA moves. Artillery strike on 2/7 in Area 11, roll 4,
miss. <strong>Blunder</strong> NVA artillery all fires at the beginning of the
game turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Game Turn Ends. ARVN surrender roll passes with 7.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These have been short turns, thankfully. It would be tough to get
through if the turn went all the way through the deck each time.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>NVA can now start bringing in reinforcements by entering units on the
east side of the map during their activation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>NVA artillery roll 5, 2 ARVN units reduced.</li>
  <li>ARVN airstrikes roll 8.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 1: NVA bring in reinforcement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 4: 1 unit moves up, 3 fire on 1/202, trying a legit
elimination this time. Draw black 3 for 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 &gt; 1 eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 5: move up and bring in 2 reinforcements. Probably should
  have done some shooting at lower odds, just to see how little strength
  it takes to reduce an opposing unit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 1: ARVN 2/7 fires on Sappers 429, draw black 3 for
  6 - 1 - 2 + 2 = 5 &gt; 2, elimated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 1: 1/272 leg attacking from Area 7 into Area 11, draw red 1
  for 2 - 1 - 3 + 3 is 1 &lt; 3, attack fails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 1: move north to reoccupy Area 9. Resistance chart moves up
  1 to 8. Airstrike would have been a good thing to do here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 3: bring in 3 reinforcements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 3: move 3 units forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 3: Two attacks from Area 8 to Area 12:
  * 2/95 attacking 1/48, draw red 3 for 6 - 1 - 3 + 3 &gt; 3, reduced.
  * 1/271 attacking 1/52 draw black 4 - 1 -2 + 3 &gt; 2 eliminated.</p>

    <p>That's 4 ARVN out of the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 3: attack with 2/95C draw red 3 for 6 - 1 - 2 + 3 = 6 &gt; 2,
eliminated. In the north, 1/95C and 2/275 draw black 4 - 1 - 3 + 6 = 6 &gt;
3, reduced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 4: attack 1/174 NVA, draw red 1 - 1 - 4 + 1 (arty) + 7 =
4 no effect. I need to use up a bunch of my airstrikes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 2: airstrikes reduced 2 NVA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 4: attack draw black 2 - 1 - 3 + 6 = 4 &gt; 3, 5/1 Airborne reduced.
Draw red 3 for 6 - 1 - 2 + 6 = 9 &gt; 2, 8/1 Airborne eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 5: bring in 2 reinforcements, attack draw black 3 - 1 - 2 +
6 = 6 &gt; 2, eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 5: all 5 airstrikesi, affected 3 NVA. Helpful.
<strong>Blunder</strong> only had 4 airstrikes left.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 2: move 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 5: attack NVA AFV, draw black 3 (Airborne card!) for 6
which will definitely eliminate DF 1 AFV. Attack other AFV in Area 7
from Area 11, draw black 1 for 2 - 1 - 1  + 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 3: attack more armor, draw red 1 - 1 - 2 + 1 (arty) + 3 =
2, failed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Game turn ends, surrender roll 2, ARVN loses.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here's what the end of the game looked like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/courage-under-fire/g1-end.jpg" alt="End of game, ARVN surrender" /></p>

<p>As can be seen, the ARVN are getting well whittled down.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Ok, that was interesting, sort of. Overall, the game play is fast and
smooth, but I didn't really see any that there was much to do other than
stand toe-to-toe and slug it out. Maybe that's what happened in real
life, I'm not familiar with the battle so I can't say. It does seem that
there should be a bit more the ARVN can do to other than get attritted
away.</p>

<p>Not sure I'll play this one again soon. It does give me a baseline on
the An Loc battle during the 1972 Easter Offensive, with some notion of
the units involved and the timescale over which the battle was fought.</p>

<p>There are seven other games in this series, of which I have What Went
Wrong already. I'll probably purchase the remaining over time just
because I am that sort of completionist.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ARVN airborne can come in on the airstrike instead of as a regular
reinforcement. I played bringing all 4 in together on a black 4
activation on Turn 2. I backtracked a bit and removed a couple from
the map to just continue, and put the NVA 1/202 back in play, reduced,
as it was eliminated via airstrike.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NVA get all their artillery strikes at the beginning of the turn.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
