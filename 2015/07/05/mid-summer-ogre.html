<p>At Endgame as usual.</p>

<p>Game 1: Breakthrough against AW, I was attacker. Won with decisive 56
point advantage, really blew AW away on this one.</p>

<p>Game 2: Breakthrough again with AW, this time playing defender. 20 point
deficit for me, technical draw for scenario. AW got quite a few units
off, but I killed a fair number as well which brought my vp score up a
lot.</p>

<p>Game 3: AW and AS for 3 player Breakthrough, huge blunder I missed
seeing a mobile howitzer which fired on a stack of 5 gevs. However, AW
forgot to move the mobile howitzer, so I killed it next turn. AW managed
to slaughter AS forces, part of which drew those forces away from mine.
I was able to get 7 units exited and killed a bunch more to almost
balance it out. AW won 102 to 99, iirc.</p>

<hr />

<p>Another game of Nam Diary, played NVA against AW. I won. AW said this
game us not unlike other games where it turns into  dice fest, as there
is no way to out maneuver without losing a round of fire.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
