What Went Wrong - Ap Bac '63
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  6 2015</time>
<p>Another game in Paul Rohrbaugh's Vietnam series of card draw area
movement, and again covering a little known battle. In this case, a 1963
skirmish between ARVN and NLF forces operating in the hamlet of Ap Bac.</p>

<p>I am aware of any other games simulating this battle.</p>

<p>As usual for HFD Games, the production quality isn't bad, striking a
middle ground between pretty good art and about the best one can do with
print-and-play.</p>

<p>Here's the set up:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/what-went-wrong/g1-start.jpg" alt="What Went Wrong set up" /></p>

<p>That's Brain Train's <em>Green Beret</em> underneath, it's next on the table
(with Fire in the Lake under that, a whole stack of Vietnam).</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly outline the situation for both sides.</p>

<h3 id="prelimary-activity">Prelimary Activity</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Shuffle deck with 1 Joker.</li>
  <li>ARVN rolls d10 for when or if the 1/4 Mechanized Cav. enters,
for the amount of Artillery Support (4.3) and the number of Air
Strikes (Day and Twilight only, see 4.4)</li>
  <li>ARVN decides whether 8th Airborne enters this turn.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="operations-sequence">Operations sequence</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Players draw cards to determine initiative and number of allowable
activations for each operational phase. An activation is a move or
combat. Joker ends the turn.</p>

<p>I think I'm missing something with respect to ARVN reinforcements,
specifically the 1/11, but not finding what I'm looking for in the
rules. I think I'll just kick this thing off instead.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Given Exception to 3.2, it looks like the ARVN gets to roll a d10 to
  kick off the games, with the number of activations equal to half,
  rerolling 0 and 1.  Roll 1, 0, 2/1 is 1 activation. Not that
  impressed. 1/1 CG fires on concealed unit in A33, which turns out
  to be a sniper, which is removed per 6.1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 1: 1/261 attacks 1/1 CG in A38: draw 8 - 0 (terrain) - 3
(DF) = 5 &gt; 3, reduced. That doesn't make any sense. There is no
use for the Attack Value in the description of combat in the rules.
This is almost surely an oversight, but still, if so, that's a
pretty major oversight.</p>

    <p>Score: NLF 1, ARVN 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 2: move NLF unit south, goal is taking out ARVN artillery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black 1: move 4/2 CG into A38 to support artillery. Next ARVN
activation needs to be an artillery mission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 7 for 3 ops: move 3 NLF from A28 to A34.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 7 for 3: 2 NLF fire into A39, draw 2 - 0 - 3 = -1, no
effect with combat conducted according to rules. Using Courage Under
Fire combat, we have 2 + 3 (AF) + 1 (2/2 CD) - 0 (terrain) - 3 (DF)
= 6 &gt; 3, ARVN reduced.</p>

    <p>Score: NLF 2, ARVN 0.</p>

    <p>So which is it? I'm going with Courage Under Fire rules I think,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 9 for 4: Move 2 NLF south, engage into A38 again: AF 5 + Q
(redrawing) + 10 - 0 - 3 = 12 &gt; 3 eliminated.</p>

    <p>Score: NLF 3, ARVN 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 10 for 5: Attack ARVN in A40, AF 5 + 6 - 0 - 3 = 8 &gt; 3,
step reduced. AF 3 + 10 - 0 - 2 = 11 &gt; 2, eliminated. 4th activation, AF
2 + 5 - 0 - 3 = 4 &gt; 3, reduced. Last activation is a move.</p>

    <p>Score: NLF 5, ARVN 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red 6 for 3: 1/261 attacks ARVN 2/1 CG, AF 3 + 2 - 0 (terrain) -
2 (DF) = 3 &gt; 2, eliminated.</p>

    <p>Score: NLF 6, ARVN 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black K, for 2: 4/2 CG attack 1/261 in A33, AF 2 + 8 - 0 - 2
(terrain) - 4 (DF) = 4 == 4, no effect. Dang. Artillery, draw 4 - 2,
no effect. Again, draw 3, no effect.</p>

    <p>I think a big part of this game is going to be card counting. There
have been a lot of high value red cards played, which means a lot of
low value cards remain in the deck.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw black Q: need to try and return a unit into play, 50% chance,
roll 4, bringing back 2/1 CG into A38.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly outline the situation for both sides.</p>

<p>So far, the NLF is chewing up the ARVN big time. I think this is partly
because I'm not playing the combat correctly, but there is an element of
luck whereby I was pulling red cards for successive activations, with
the black cards coming up for combat resolution when the NLF was
attacking. Vicious circle to be sure. On this turn, I am probably going
to need to bring in some ARVN reinforcements, and I will certainly try
to get the ARVN into some of the hamlet areas to accrue victory points.</p>

<p>No reinforcements or replacements available yet, so we're off to the

Bang, AF 2 + 3 - 2 - 4 = -1 &lt; 4, no effect; Airstrike by the numbers,
draw 10 - 2 - 4 = 4, no effect. This is interesting, as it looks like
2/514 and similar units are immune to airstrikes if in a -2 area, and
very difficult to affect otherwise (need very high card draw to
overcome DF 4. Very odd. ARVN passes on last activation. Not enough
units to matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw red J for 2: NLF moves south.</p>

Ok, so artillery and airstrikes are useless to me the way I
understand the rules. The remaining activations are used by ARVN

<p>This is really not satisfying. I must really be missing something.</p>

<p>Anyway, getting on with it, ARVN Morale moves to 6, which is -1 on all

since there are 5 ARVN units eliminated, that gives us a -10 DRM, on a
d10. How about that.</p>

<p>Game over.</p>

<p>The best thing about this turn is that went really fast, about 20
minutes, and I can pack the game away.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The only real issue I have with these card draw games is that I'm
finding it very difficult to evaluate the balance from playing
solitaire.</p>

<p>One thing I really like about card draw is the granularity of operations
is very small. While the turns may be long, it's not necessary to play
an entire turn. Playing a single card draw is very fast. This lets me
run the game over a period of several days quite easily. Whenever I have
a few moments, say before or after work, it's easy to draw a few cards
and advance the game.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<p>I wasn't going to record any blunders this turn, but I've learned enough
of the rules to make it worthwhile, and I'm a bit more engaged with it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Massive: I've totally punished ARVN by attacking from A33 into A38,
but that's not allowed: there is A37, a narrow strip of woods, between
these two areas. For game balance, I allowed a last ARVN attack back
across from A37 to A33, but no more after that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did not subtract 1 for firing on concealed units, and in fact, removed
concealment on one of them when I fired on it by ARVN. This is not
correct, concealment is only removed when the unit itself fires.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concealment comes off when an NLF unit moves (6.4). I didn't play it
this way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reducing ARVN CD activations for low morale in Turn 4. This would have
prevented one of the NLF eliminations as an Ace would result in 0 for
the CD.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The card draw system for resolving combat seems slightly odd. As I write
this having played through Courage Under Fire and through part of the
first turn in What Went Wrong, I don't have any sense of tactical game
whatsoever. So far, the most obvious thing to do is just blast away and
hope the cards support the decision. The card draw allows hopelessly
weak units to defeat <em>any</em> opposing force, simply by getting lucky. The
attack factor on the units seems totally irrelevant. Perhaps I'm playing
it wrong?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DF units in hamlets are apparently immune to airstrikes. Reading the
rules literally, the best card which could be drawn is a 10, and that
doesn't do it. Adding an ARVN unit in the AREA means <em>only</em> drawing a
10 card will reduce. This is so odd. Combat seems to be either
guaranteed reduction, or virtually invincible. Very few resolutions come
out to be right in the balance, they are either many points ahead, or
behind. I cannot be playing this correctly.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h3>

<p>I'm probably going to purchase the remaining HFD Vietnam games mostly
because they cover battles nobody else has covered, or possibly even
heard of.  To me, this might be worthwhile enough.</p>

<p>There is a real chance I'm "playing totally wrong." Perhaps I will
figure it out after a few more plays.</p>

<p>Also, this is my second area movement game, Courage Under Fire being my
first. If this is what area movement games are like, I can categorically
state right now that I prefer hex and counter. I take that back,
actually, Fire in the Lake probably qualifies for area movement, but
it's at regional scale instead of tactical scale. So far, not sold on
area movement for tactical scale.</p>

<p>Accurately keeping score requires paying attention to the record track
after every card draw. There are several ways to score for each side,
and will be hard to remember unless the scores are immediately advanced
after gaining.</p>

<p>Given the maps and OOB are reasonable facsimiles of the battle, it
should be possible to bolt on a different rule set. I think the combat
system should be totally overhauled though. While an odds-based CRT
might not be a good solution, a differential CRT similar to what's used
in Snoopy's Nose might work quite well.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
