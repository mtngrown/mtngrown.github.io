Barbarossa on a very small map
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul 18 2015</time>
<p>I'm in the middle of a solo game of the Full Fire in the Lake scenario,
card 52 of the 78 in the full deck. I'd like to say I'd finish it today,
but I don't believe I have the energy for that, neither mental nor
physical. Plus, the novelty is wearing off, and it's getting to be work
now. That means it's time to break out something really lightweight and
take a bit of a break.</p>

<p>Normally, I don't like having two games going on at the same time, which
means I more often than not do have two games going at the same time.
But Target Leningrad is a pretty small game, I'm very comfortable with
the other games in the series, and I'm not planning on logging the turns
in any detail on this first game. It's mostly to compare and contrast
rules between Target Leningrad, Battle for Moscow, and Objective: Kiev.</p>

<p>As usual for games in this series, setting up is fast and easy. There
are only 15-20 pieces on the board, if that.</p>

<p>After two turns, I can see this is definitely an interesting little
puzzle. The Russians have to fall back really fast, while trying to
block the Germans at at the same time.</p>

<p>After four turns, that is, half way through, it's not looking quite as
good for the Germans. The Russians have walled up around Leningrad, and
it's going to be tough for the Germans to fight through. One thing which
hasn't helped the Germans early on is a lot of DR results for even
fairly high odds. If even a couple more Russian units could have been
eliminated, the Germans could have gotten behind them to cut off supply.
No such luck this game.</p>

<p>And the German concede to the Russians on Turn 7, as there is no way
they are going to be able to either capture or isolate Leningrad.
Here's what it looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g1-t7-end.jpg" alt="End of Turn 7, Germans have no
hope" /></p>

<p>This is the usual game of this series. If the Germans do the obvious
thing, whatever that may be, they're going to lose.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
