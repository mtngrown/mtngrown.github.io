                Another Egyptian Air Mobile attempt
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul 21 2015</time>
              <p>A return to Situation A-3, where the Egyptians helicopter in a small
              force with Saggers to ambush Israeli armor. The last time they tried
              this they got chewed up.</p>
              
              <p>Before I get started on this game, it's worth reviewing the helicopter
              rules and the WEC.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Helicopters move during the friendly air phase, not the friendly
              movement phase. (AR-I, E.1)</li>
                <li>Helicopters get full movement allowance even if inverted or dispersed.
              (AR-I, E2.c)</li>
                <li>Helicopters attacking nullify hull-down advantage for defender. (AR-I,
              E.5)</li>
                <li>Helicopter can carry up to 3 infantry class units, where Sagger units
              count for 1/2. (AR-I, E.9a)</li>
                <li>Loading or unloading a helicopter requires the full movement
              allowance. (AR-I, E.9b)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>The rest of the rules are more or less common sense, the above list
              representing the most tactically important rules.</p>
              
              <p>The big puzzle in this game is figuring out how the Egyptians can get
              first fire.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of Turn 1" src="/images/arab-israeli-wars/g5-t1.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>The Egyptians set down just out of reach of the guns.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
              
              <p>The Israelis cannot fire on Egyptian helicopter in the air at the
              current range of 8 hexes, so they swing to the north and charge.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Israelis make a run along the north side" src="/images/arab-israeli-wars/g5-t2-israeli-move.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>The Egyptians have half lost the battle given the Israelis are already
              half way across the playing area. They will need to bottle it up really
              tight.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Egyptians reposition" src="/images/arab-israeli-wars/g5-t2-egyptian-move.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>The green marker die indicate helicopters unloading infantry and Sagger
              units. The blue marker die indicates a helicopter unit which moved
              during the turn. Three of the helicopters are now within range of tank
              fire.</p>
              
              <p>The Israelis are now in a bit of a bind. If they make a run for it, they
              might make it, but they'll but subject to opportunity fire from both
              helicopters and Saggers. On the other hand, if they stay and fight, they
              will be able to destroy the Egyptians within range, but risk getting
              stuck as the clock winds down.</p>
              
              <p>At this point, I need to unlimber the rule book and check out how
              opportunity fire works. I've tried to set up the Saggers and helicopters
              to exploit it, we'll see what happens.</p>
              
              <p>First, opportunity fire as defined in Standard Rules part II section E
              (SR-II, E). This is two columns of dense text.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Opportunity fire can be applied to units which are loading and
              unloading.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Let's see if a couple of the Israeli units can knock
              out some helicopters or Saggers. Spreading out the Egyptian counter
              stacks:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Egyptians reposition" src="/images/arab-israeli-wars/g5-t2-opfire.png" /></p>
              
              <p>The Egyptian helicopters landed in B-K8 (T1), B-H7 (T2) and B-J4 (T3) in
              Turn 1, and were out of range during that turn while in the air. Armor
              on air max range is 7 hexes, these landing zones were just out of range.
              However, the Israelis moved up during their Turn 2 movement, such that
              they're in range of the Egyptians to conduct opportunity fire while the
              Egyptians are unloading (SR-II, E.3h). This is because unloading
              requires all movement points for both carrier and passengers, which
              satisfies the 1/4 movement necessary for activating a target for
              opportunity fire.</p>
              
              <p>So what's the best course of action for the Israelis here? They get
              first fire with opportunity fire, but it will invert them through their
              next movement phase, possibly exposing them to return fire.</p>
              
              <p>Here's what's going down:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Israeli 6414 will opfire on hex BJ4 targeting Sagger unit 1621.
              With weapon type A range 6 hexes against target NA, attack strength
              quartered from 25 to 6, so 3:1 odds with defending having Hull Down
              advantage (BR-VII, F.2b).  Roll 3 + 2 for 5 yields Dispersed.
              6414 is inverted.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Israeli 6415 will opfire on BH7 targeting Sagger unit 1622.
              Roll 4 for DD, no Hull Down. 6415 is inverted.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Ok, both Saggers are dispersed for now. Every little bit helps.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
              
              <p>Going into Turn 3, I'm now wondering what the difference between doing
              the opportunity fire from the Israelis last turn and the fire phase for
              this turn. In this case, there is no difference.</p>
              
              <p>Israelis choose not to do any firing in favor of movement, specifically,
              overrunning the stack in BK8.</p>
              
              <p>However, the Sagger unit makes an opportunity fire attack on 6417,
              succeeding in dispersing it.</p>
              
              <p>The infantry units are going to make a 1:2 attack on 6418 which is one
              of the overrunning Israelis. If this succeeds in dispersing, it might
              drop the odds to allow for a dispersal rather than a sure elimination.
              Roll 3 for combined 12:15 for 1:2, no effect. The overrun scores 5 for 1
              Sagger, 2 infantry and 1 MI8 destroyed.</p>
              
              <p>All Israeli units are either dispersed or inverted. Egyptian phase.</p>
              
              <p>Air phase:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>9122 and 9123 will conduct air strikes against Israeli tanks next turn.
              They will be able to stay out of range. The advanced air rules do not
              require specifying a target or target hex in advance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>DOWN markers removed, 9122 and 9123 fly out of range of
              Israelis, go DOWN in hex BD2.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Since the remaining Saggers are either dispersed or unloading, and
              nothing else is in range, Egyptians roll for Morale: 1621 passes, 1622
              fails and remains dispersed. This will be costly.</p>
              
              <p>Here's the situation at the end of Turn 3:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of Turn 3" src="/images/arab-israeli-wars/g5-t3.jpg" /></p>

              <p>The Israelis have no air in this situation, so it's on to the fire
              phase.</p>
              
              <p>No indirect attacks, so it's time for direct fire.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>6414 and 6416 on to Sagger 1621. The odds are 50/4:2 which is 6:1, but
              the Sagger also gets +2 on the die roll for Hull Down. Roll 5 + 2 = 7
              which is dispersed. Lucky!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>6415 on to Sagger 1622 which is already dispersed, at 3:1 with no DRM,
              roll 2 which is a kill.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>6418 fire on Sagger 1624 at 3:1 with no DRM, roll 3, DD.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>That's a lot of firing for the Israelis, but they've essentially
              defanged the Egyptian Sagger units.</p>
              
              <p>Israeli movement, Egyptian infantry make opportunity fire on 6413, 1:1
              roll 2 Dispersed.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>6418 fires on Sagger 1624 at 2:1 roll 3 - 1 for 2 which DD, a kill

              <p>And that's it for the Saggers. They got off one shot at 2:1 for a
              dispersal. Now all the Israeli tanks need to do is drive around the
              infantry and off the board. No need to get within CAT range, ever.</p>

              <p>First fire really matters in this game, and not just a single lucky
              shot, it's being able to take several shots before the opponent can
              fire. The Israelis have done this both games.</p>
              
              <p>In this game as in the last, the Israelis have also had some nice dice.
              For example, always passing morale checks. The Egyptians wish they could
              say the same.</p>

              Specifically, the rules seem to allow a direct fire attack through
              another unit either friendly or enemy. I don't like this, it doesn't
              make sense to me. I'm going to play it as written for this game, even
              though it's going to really hurt the Egyptians.</p>

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.

                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.

              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
