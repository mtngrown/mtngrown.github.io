Another Egyptian Air Mobile attempt
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul 21 2015</time>
<p>A return to Situation A-3, where the Egyptians helicopter in a small
force with Saggers to ambush Israeli armor. The last time they tried
this they got chewed up.</p>

<p>Before I get started on this game, it's worth reviewing the helicopter
rules and the WEC.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Helicopters move during the friendly air phase, not the friendly
movement phase. (AR-I, E.1)</li>
  <li>Helicopters get full movement allowance even if inverted or dispersed.
(AR-I, E2.c)</li>
  <li>Helicopters attacking nullify hull-down advantage for defender. (AR-I,
E.5)</li>
  <li>Helicopter can carry up to 3 infantry class units, where Sagger units
count for 1/2. (AR-I, E.9a)</li>
  <li>Loading or unloading a helicopter requires the full movement
allowance. (AR-I, E.9b)</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the rules are more or less common sense, the above list
representing the most tactically important rules.</p>

<p>The big puzzle in this game is figuring out how the Egyptians can get
first fire.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/arab-israeli-wars/g5-t1.jpg" alt="End of Turn 1" /></p>

<p>The Egyptians set down just out of reach of the guns.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>The Israelis cannot fire on Egyptian helicopter in the air at the
current range of 8 hexes, so they swing to the north and charge.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/arab-israeli-wars/g5-t2-israeli-move.jpg" alt="Israelis make a run along the north side" /></p>

<p>The Egyptians have half lost the battle given the Israelis are already
half way across the playing area. They will need to bottle it up really
tight.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/arab-israeli-wars/g5-t2-egyptian-move.jpg" alt="Egyptians reposition" /></p>

<p>The green marker die indicate helicopters unloading infantry and Sagger
units. The blue marker die indicates a helicopter unit which moved
during the turn. Three of the helicopters are now within range of tank
fire.</p>

<p>The Israelis are now in a bit of a bind. If they make a run for it, they
might make it, but they'll but subject to opportunity fire from both
helicopters and Saggers. On the other hand, if they stay and fight, they
will be able to destroy the Egyptians within range, but risk getting
stuck as the clock winds down.</p>

<p>At this point, I need to unlimber the rule book and check out how
opportunity fire works. I've tried to set up the Saggers and helicopters
to exploit it, we'll see what happens.</p>

<p>First, opportunity fire as defined in Standard Rules part II section E
(SR-II, E). This is two columns of dense text.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Opportunity fire can be applied to units which are loading and
unloading.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's see if a couple of the Israeli units can knock
out some helicopters or Saggers. Spreading out the Egyptian counter
stacks:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/arab-israeli-wars/g5-t2-opfire.png" alt="Egyptians reposition" /></p>

<p>The Egyptian helicopters landed in B-K8 (T1), B-H7 (T2) and B-J4 (T3) in
Turn 1, and were out of range during that turn while in the air. Armor
on air max range is 7 hexes, these landing zones were just out of range.
However, the Israelis moved up during their Turn 2 movement, such that
they're in range of the Egyptians to conduct opportunity fire while the
Egyptians are unloading (SR-II, E.3h). This is because unloading
requires all movement points for both carrier and passengers, which
satisfies the 1/4 movement necessary for activating a target for
opportunity fire.</p>

<p>So what's the best course of action for the Israelis here? They get
first fire with opportunity fire, but it will invert them through their
next movement phase, possibly exposing them to return fire.</p>

<p>Here's what's going down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Israeli 6414 will opfire on hex BJ4 targeting Sagger unit 1621.
With weapon type A range 6 hexes against target NA, attack strength
quartered from 25 to 6, so 3:1 odds with defending having Hull Down
advantage (BR-VII, F.2b).  Roll 3 + 2 for 5 yields Dispersed.
6414 is inverted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Israeli 6415 will opfire on BH7 targeting Sagger unit 1622.
Roll 4 for DD, no Hull Down. 6415 is inverted.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, both Saggers are dispersed for now. Every little bit helps.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Going into Turn 3, I'm now wondering what the difference between doing
the opportunity fire from the Israelis last turn and the fire phase for
this turn. In this case, there is no difference.</p>

<p>Israelis choose not to do any firing in favor of movement, specifically,
overrunning the stack in BK8.</p>

<p>However, the Sagger unit makes an opportunity fire attack on 6417,
succeeding in dispersing it.</p>

<p>The infantry units are going to make a 1:2 attack on 6418 which is one
of the overrunning Israelis. If this succeeds in dispersing, it might
drop the odds to allow for a dispersal rather than a sure elimination.
Roll 3 for combined 12:15 for 1:2, no effect. The overrun scores 5 for 1
Sagger, 2 infantry and 1 MI8 destroyed.</p>

<p>All Israeli units are either dispersed or inverted. Egyptian phase.</p>

<p>Air phase:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>9122 and 9123 will conduct air strikes against Israeli tanks next turn.
They will be able to stay out of range. The advanced air rules do not
require specifying a target or target hex in advance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DOWN markers removed, 9122 and 9123 fly out of range of
Israelis, go DOWN in hex BD2.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since the remaining Saggers are either dispersed or unloading, and
nothing else is in range, Egyptians roll for Morale: 1621 passes, 1622
fails and remains dispersed. This will be costly.</p>

<p>Here's the situation at the end of Turn 3:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/arab-israeli-wars/g5-t3.jpg" alt="End of Turn 3" /></p>

<p>Score: Israelis 5, Egyptians 0.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<h3 id="israeli-turn-4">Israeli Turn 4</h3>

<p>The Israelis have no air in this situation, so it's on to the fire
phase.</p>

<p>No indirect attacks, so it's time for direct fire.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>6414 and 6416 on to Sagger 1621. The odds are 50/4:2 which is 6:1, but
the Sagger also gets +2 on the die roll for Hull Down. Roll 5 + 2 = 7
which is dispersed. Lucky!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6415 on to Sagger 1622 which is already dispersed, at 3:1 with no DRM,
roll 2 which is a kill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6418 fire on Sagger 1624 at 3:1 with no DRM, roll 3, DD.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That's a lot of firing for the Israelis, but they've essentially
defanged the Egyptian Sagger units.</p>

<p>Israeli movement, Egyptian infantry make opportunity fire on 6413, 1:1
roll 2 Dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="egyptian-turn-4">Egyptian Turn 4</h3>

<p>Egyptian air phase, 9121 fires on dispersed 6413 at 2:1, roll 6 - 1 = 5
which means 6413 stays dispersed. Would have liked to kill it.</p>

<p>The other two birds attack 6417 at 4:1, roll 2 for X.</p>

<p>No direct fire, Saggers are out of commission.</p>

<p>Morale check: Sagger 1624 fails, 1621 passes.</p>

<p>Egyptian moving infantry to attempt to draw the Israeli into CAT range.</p>

<p>Score: Israeli 6, Egyptian 4.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<h3 id="israeli-turn-5">Israeli Turn 5</h3>

<p>Straight to direct fire.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>6418 fires on Sagger 1624 at 2:1 roll 3 - 1 for 2 which DD, a kill
since the target is already dispersed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6416 and 6414 on to Sagger 1621 at 4:1 roll 1 + 2 (Hull Down) for 3,
which is X.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it for the Saggers. They got off one shot at 2:1 for a
dispersal. Now all the Israeli tanks need to do is drive around the
infantry and off the board. No need to get within CAT range, ever.</p>

<p>Israeli movement: 2 tanks at the edge hex, Egyptians cannot catch them.</p>

<h3 id="egyptian-turn-5">Egyptian Turn 5</h3>

<p>Fire phase: 5 Egyptian infantry fire on 6415 at 2:1, roll 3 for DD.</p>

<p>Move remaining units west.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<h2 id="israeli">Israeli</h2>

<p>No firing, all movement to get off the board in time.</p>

<p>Egyptians take opfire at 1:1 roll 5 for no effect.</p>

<h2 id="egyptian">Egyptian</h2>

<p>Movement and CAT for Egyptians: 6x3 is 18:15, 1:1 roll 6 - 4. Dang.
The Egyptians just do not get a break today.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p>Israeli just moves to get off the board, Egyptians take opfires: 1:1
roll 4, no effect, another Israeli off the board. Another, roll 4, no
effect. Dang.</p>

<p>Egyptians concede, Israeli score 8 kills + 20 (5 tanks) for 8. Egyptian
score 4 for one Israeli tank kill.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Game completed August 2, 2015.</p>

<p>First fire really matters in this game, and not just a single lucky
shot, it's being able to take several shots before the opponent can
fire. The Israelis have done this both games.</p>

<p>In this game as in the last, the Israelis have also had some nice dice.
For example, always passing morale checks. The Egyptians wish they could
say the same.</p>

<p>I'm finding it hard to find the balance in this scenario.</p>

<p>For the next game, I'm going to use the airstrikes to pound on the tanks
from out of range of the anti-air fire to knock out hopefully 2 tanks.
The Saggers will advance on foot from the edge of the board to attempt
to acquire crossfire setups. The infantry will land in areas 1 hex out
of LOS such that they're next advance is into a hull down position
behind a dune crest. Will be interesting to see if this can be done. I
think the Egyptians really should be able to destroy 2 tanks no matter
what.</p>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What kind of target is a helicopter when it's on the ground and
unloading? The rules seem to read that unloading helicopters are
given a DOWN marker, and that the helicopter is still an F target
but with no Hull Down benefit per the Sighting Effect Chart.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens with LOS when a unit is "shielded" by another unit?
Specifically, the rules seem to allow a direct fire attack through
another unit either friendly or enemy. I don't like this, it doesn't
make sense to me. I'm going to play it as written for this game, even
though it's going to really hurt the Egyptians.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
