Mark Herman's Churchill - a first look
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug  2 2015</time>
<p>This is a brand new one which came last week or so. It's getting a lot
of really good press, and I'm on a drive to play some newer games
instead of focusing on vintages, so I cracked it open for a first look
following the playthrough tutorial.</p>

<p>I realize I'll be excoriated for the following, but I didn't the rules
initially very easy to get into. I'm more used to a more classis wargame
style rulebook. That said, the game doesn't appear to be that difficult,
and as usual, I have to play it to get it.</p>

<p>The playthrough is stream of conscious starting from the tutorial
scenario, and I had some difficulty figuring out what to do. It turns
out the Staff Cards are chosen randomly at the beginning of each
conference, but the playthrough assume this is known and has been done.</p>

<p>To make it easier for the future, here's the staff card list for the
playthrough:</p>

<ul>
  <li>US: Morgenthau, Crowly, Donovan, Hopkins, Harriman, Walker and
Embrick.</li>
  <li>USSR: Malenkov, Molotov, Budyonny, Kuznetsov, Zhukov, Voznesensky,
Merkulov.</li>
  <li>UK: Atlee, Menzies, Bevin, Cunningham, Beaverbrook, Portal and Pound.</li>
</ul>

<p>The conference phase was pretty easy to get through, the ensuing
military (war) phase not so much. This requires (me) some close reading
of the rules, starting from Section 7.0 War Phase. And it turns out
these are pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>Let's try the next conference, #9.</p>

<h2 id="conference-9">Conference 9</h2>

<p>First, reset all the issues. Then draw staff cards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>US: Knox, Stimson, Hull, Marshall, Hopkins, Arnold and Perkins.</li>
  <li>USSR: Meretskov, Zhdanov, Malenkov, Molotov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan and
Vasilevsky.</li>
  <li>UK: Pound, Lyttleton, Anderson, Cripps, Eden, Wilson and Tovey.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll play this hand as US.</p>

<p>And now I'm getting sucked in. I just finished the Agenda round for the
9th conference, and I'm already thinking about how I want to write it
up. This wasn't the goal for this game! The goal was to just play
through it without worrying over much about the details.</p>

<p>2 hands is enough for today. This is not a particularly difficult game
compared to Fire in the Lake, or even Arab Israeli Wars.</p>

  <li>USSR rolls 2, 38 + 1 = 39.</li>
  <li>UK rolls 4, 24 + 4 = 28.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cool game, looking forward to playing it with a group.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
