                Viet Nam (for Interested Americans)
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug  9 2015</time>
              <p>Viet Nam is an unusual game for several reasons. First, it was published
              in 1965, right at the beginning of the US involvement in Vietnam.
              Second, it's very much a counter-insurgency and political game as well
              as a wargame, possibly more so. This may not be all the unusual now, but
              it was very much so when it was published. The first edition evidently
              came in a tube, as I have that tube and the map has never been folded.
              The wrapper on the outside of the tube states "For Interested Americans"
              which is about as charming a piece of copy as I've seen. The game itself
              claims to be a "guerilla warfare game."</p>
              
              <p>The game seems relatively simple. Players bluff on intentions, the
              winner advancing on the victory track, the losing retreating. Movement
              and combat are simple.</p>
              
              <p>Here's the set up:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Viet Nam set up to play" src="/images/viet-nam/g1-setup.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Some items of note:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>The red disks are the insurgents, the green the counter-insurgent
              forces.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Initially, I'm randomizing the counter-insurgency table located in the
              middle of the map. There are six possible actions, with nine points
              available to spend on those actions (denoted by pawns). Rolling 9
              appropriately colored dice for each side does that job nicely.</p>

                <li>Political Stability: GF 1:VC 0, GF advances from Weak to Weak + 1.</li>
                <li>World Opinion: GF:VC is 2:1, GF Index to 26, VC Index to 24. The rules
              don't make any sense here, because UP and DOWN are the same direction
              with respect to the numbers on the Index Track. In other words, no
              matter who wins the bid here, both players advance towards win. I'm
              going to assume that "up" means advance towards the bid winner's
              victory, and "down" is advance towards the losing player's losing
              condition.</li>
                <li>Terror: GF:VC is 1:4, Index Pawns move to 23, VC places regular unit
              in Quang Tri (Space 4).</li>
                <li>Ambush: GF:VC is 1:3, VC ambush in Siagon 26 and Bien Hoa 28.</li>

              with GF Irregulars.</li>
                    <li>Same result for VC 3.3.</li>
                  </ul>

              adjacent friendly space if possible (the replacement pool if not).</p>

              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>The rules in this game are not as well organized as they could be, with
              the observation that the main body of the rules is an extended and
              detailed sequence of play. Most modern games have a rather more succinct
              sequence of play, usually consisting of little more than an outline.
              The explanations for each step or phase in the sequence are punted into
              the main body of the rules.  This is fine for players who have the rules
              down pat. I found learning the flow of Viet Nam was very easy because
              the sequence of play is more detailed.</p>
              
              <p>This middle ground between an outline and burying the sequence of play
              in the rules is fertile ground for fan-made player aids. Conversely, in
              Viet Nam, the player aids need to go in the other direction to
              consolidate relevant material appropriately in the rules.</p>
              
              <p>Overall, I didn't find the game that much fun to solo. In part, it's
              really hard to work the Insurgency bids concurrently, and making them
              completely random isn't all the satisyfing either. I made a sincere
              vow to play through 12 turns, which would be one year of game time, but
              it really started to drag very early on. (This may in part be because I
              have a solo game working the bot playthroughs in Fire in the Lake
              scheduled next.)</p>
              
              <p>Simultaneous order ("Military Orders") increase the difficulty of solo
              play for me, as there is just enough complexity to make it a bit
              tedious. In other simultaneous movement games such as StarForce, the
              complexity is lower, so it's not as much of burden. Complex games
              without simultaneous movement don't induce the same burden, as it's
              often difficult to remember the details specific to each side when
              playing the opposition.</p>
              
              <p>The game revolves around controlling 47 provinces in South Vietnam. I'm
              pretty sure that with a bit of tinkering, these rules could be used with
              the 23 provinces and cities on the Fire in the Lake board.</p>
              
              <p>On other hand, I'd be delighted to play the game all the way through
              with an opponent. It's definitely worthy of at least one serious play.</p>
              
              <h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>It's not clear to me how the Irregular forces contribute to combat and
              suffer combat results, if at all.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>It's not clear whether the GF can take an AF unit as a loss during
              combat. This would be really handy as it allows the Regular units to
              stay on the ground and retain control. Otherwise I'm not sure of the
              efficacy of the AF units for tactical combat. According to the rules,
              it looks like the AF units <em>can</em> soak up the losses, but they are not
              destroyed as regular units would be.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>It's not clear to me how many units may occupy a base, nor what the
              relationship of a base to the province is.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
