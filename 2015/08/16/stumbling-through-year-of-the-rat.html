Stumbling through Year of the Rat
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 16 2015</time>
<p>Year of the Rat is notable for several reasons, one of which is the game
was designed, developed and published concurrently with the 1972 Easter
Offensive conducted by the NVA, which it attempts to simulate, by what
would now be considered a superstar team: Prados (design), Dunnigan
(development) and Simonsen (art).</p>

<p>We played through the whole game without any trouble in 4-5 hours.
Similar to Sealords, a lot of the action seems to take place in the
early turns, with the later turns moving much faster. For <em>Year of the
Rat</em>, this turn time decrease is in part due to NVA forces having
limited supply, hence limited combat capability after the first two
turns. For the first two turns, "Attack Supply" is assumed and the NVA
are free to attack as many times as possible. After the first towo
turns, Attack Supply must be provisioned, and there aren't many supply
caches available (6, if I recall correctly).</p>

<p>Given the supply problem faced by the NVA player, the strategy has be
to snatch as much territory as possible, as fast as possible, then make
ARVN pay dearly to get it back.</p>

<h2 id="game-play">Game play</h2>

<p>One of the more interesting aspects of game play is the high cost of
engaging and disengaging from zones of control, with ARVN paying more
movement factors than the NVA. Along with that, moving from ZOC to ZOC
controlled by the same unit is prohibited. This leads to a tactic for
the NVA where ZOC control can prevent ARVN from engaging due to stacked
ZOC penalties exceeding the movement allowance.</p>

<p>We (AS) did not use ARVN's airborne capabiltity at all, which likely
contributed to his decisive loss: not getting enough battles in to drive
NVA away from objective hexes.</p>

<p>The NVA (me) wasn't able to use up all the supply available, due to
being out of range for certain objectives. The NVA player has to
carefully plan in advance what the overall strategy will be, and commit
to it. From this first play, it seems likely that a good ARVN player
could really stomp the NVA if the NVA attempted to wing it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We like the game overall, and plan to play it again.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
