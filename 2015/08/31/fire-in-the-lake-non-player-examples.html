                Fire in the Lake Non-player examples
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 31 2015</time>
              <p>The standard advice for learning Fire in the Lake (and probably other
              COIN games) is to play a solo game with all four factions first, before
              attempting to use the Bot system to drive non-player factions. Since
              I've now done that, it's time to dig into the Bot system, starting with
              the examples given in the Playbook.</p>
              
              <p>The goal for this game is playing through Example 1, followed by my own
              attempt at the follow bot move.</p>
              
              <h2 id="the-tet-offensive">The Tet Offensive</h2>
              
              <p>As per the playbook, the starting point is Laser Guided Bombs (20) in
              play, with Brinks Hotel (97) on deck. The VC Tet Offensive (124) trumps
              Laser Guided Bombs. The conditions for Tet as defined on the event card
              are met, there are more than 20 VC in the South, and 2 or more Coup!
              cards in play.</p>
              
              <p>More:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>The Event card has the VC indicator in a halo. Reading the associated
              text located on the Random Spaces Foldout, the Event is associated
              with General Uprising, and governs placement of VC into spaces.</li>
                <li>Tet Offensive trumps all other factions offensives.</li>
                <li>If I understand this correctly, with all factions eligible, the NVA
              are next up on the Tet card, hence get Operation and Activity
              following the Tet event. <strong>Check this.</strong></li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>The Tet Offensive event text reads:</p>
              
              <blockquote>
              <b>General uprising:</b> Free Terror with 1 Underground VC per space. Place
              6 VC pieces in any cities. VC+NVA Guerrillas free Attack where enemies
              (remove VC first).
              </blockquote>
              
              <p>Let's break this down into an enumerated list:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Free Terror for spaces with existing underground guerrillas.</li>
                <li>Place 6 VC in any Cities.</li>
                <li>Free Attacks where any VC+NVA guerrillas, with VC guerrillas removed
              first on Attack results.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h3 id="free-terror">1. Free Terror</h3>
              
              <p>Reading through Section 3.3.4 of the rules, we have the following for
              Terror operations:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Requires at least 1 Underground VC Guerrilla, or 1 NVA Troop cube.</li>
                <li>Activate the Underground Guerrilla for the VC, and NVA if lacking
              Troop cube.</li>
                <li>Province or City without a Terror marker gets a Terror marker.</li>
                <li>LoC without Sabotage marker gets a Sabotage marker.</li>
                <li>If VC, shift Support one level towards Active Opposition.</li>
                <li>If NVA, shift Support one level towards Neutral.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Spaces with Underground VC are:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Kien Giang: No change to Active Opposition.</li>
                <li>Ba Xuyen: Passive Oppose to Active Oppose, Oppose+Bases to 24.</li>
                <li>Kien-Hoa: Passive Oppose to Active Oppose, Oppose+Bases to 26.</li>
                <li>Kien Phong: Passive Oppose to Active Oppose, Oppose+Bases to 28.</li>
                <li>Tay Ninh: No change to Active Opposition.</li>
                <li>Saigon: Active Support to Passive Support, Support+Available to 31.</li>
                <li>Binh Tuy: Neutral to Passive Oppose, Oppose+Bases to 29.</li>
                <li>Phuoc Loung: No population here, so not sure why it matters, but
              moves from Neutral to Passive Opposition.</li>
                <li>Khanh Hoa: Active to Passive Support, Support+Available to 30.</li>
                <li>Quang Duc: Neutral to Passive Opposition, Oppose+Bases to 30.</li>
                <li>Pleiku: Active to Passive Support, Support+Available to 29.</li>
                <li>Phu Bon: Passive Support to Neutral, Support+Available to 28.</li>
                <li>Binh Dinh, Active to Passive Support, Support+Available to 26.</li>
                <li>Quang Nam: No change to Active Opposition.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>That's a lot, and will be costly for US/ARVN to remove Terror from these
              spaces.</p>
              
              <h3 id="place-6-vc-guerillas">2. Place 6 VC Guerillas</h3>
              
              <p>First question: are these placed Underground or Activated?</p>
              
              <p>I'm assuming these are placed in Underground mode.</p>
              
              <p>The text on the Random Spaces Foldout reads:</p>
              
              <blockquote>
              For General uprising, place guerrillas then bases in Siagon, Hue &amp; 4
              random (possibly same) Cities.
              </blockquote>
              
              <p>Question: what governs placing VC Bases instead of Underground
              guerrillas?</p>
              
              <p>Die rolls red-yellow-blue:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>1-2-3: Da Nang.</li>
                <li>5-3-1: Southern Laos -&gt; Hue.</li>
                <li>3-2-3: Binh Tuy -&gt; Qui Nhon.</li>
                <li>6-6-4: Hue.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>That's pretty straightforward.</p>
              
              <p>By my count, with 23 VC on the map at the start, placing 6 more makes 29
              leaving 1 VC Available.</p>
              
              <h3 id="free-attacks">3. Free Attacks</h3>
              
              <p>Tet requires mandatory attack any spaces where there are VC and enemy
              pieces (US or ARVN). Where NVA guerrillas are colocated, they are also
              used in the attack.</p>
              
              <p>The following spaces have VC guerrillas and enemy units:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Kien Giang: 1 VC, 3 ARVN.</li>
                <li>Ba Xuyen: 1 VC, 1 Police.</li>
                <li>Kien Hoa: 1 VC, 1 Police.</li>
                <li>Kien Phong: 1 VC, 1 Police.</li>
                <li>Tay Ninh: 3 VC, 2 NVA, 3 US, 3 ARVN.</li>
                <li>Binh Tuy: 2 VC, 2 US, 1 Police, 3 ARVN.</li>
                <li>Khanh Hoa: 2 VC, 1 Police, 3 US.</li>
                <li>Pleiku: 2 VC, 1 Police, 3 US.</li>
                <li>Phu Bon: 2 VC, 2 Police, 2 ARVN, 3 US.</li>
                <li>Qui Nhon: 1 VC, 2 Police, 1 US.</li>
                <li>Binh Dinh: 2 VC, 1 Police, 3 US.</li>
                <li>Da Nang: 1 VC, 2 Police, 1 US.</li>
                <li>Hue: 3 VC, 2 Police, 1 US.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>From the example in the playbook, Hue, Tay Ninh and Saigon have
              successful attacks:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Hue: From Rule 8.1.2, because no Ranger or SF,
              target US first, then alternate evenly among
              remaining pieces starting with whichever is most in the space. In Hue,
              the US piece is removed for sure, then one of the police, and only 1 of the
              VC due to the US Troop removed. <em>Note: VC are not removed for any other
              reason than US Troop or Base in an Attack.</em> <strong>COIN control is lost!</strong>
              COIN+Patron to 42.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Tay Ninh: Take 1 US and ARVN Ranger for 1 VC. COIN control is lost
              here as well. (The example graphic on page 17 of the Playbook is wrong,
              it show both the Ranger and COIN control in Tay Ninh after Tet.)
              COIN+Patron to 40.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Saigon: Take 1 US and 1 Ranger for 1 VC. Note that page 17
              illustration doesn't agree with the text or Rule 8.1.2. There is still
              a Ranger shown in Saigon instead of being moved to Available. Also,
              there is 1 too many Police units. The setup calls for 3, 4 are shown.
              (Or, there is a typo in the setup, <strong>Check the errata here</strong>.)</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3 id="results">Results</h3>
              
              <ul>
                <li>COIN control lost in Tay Ninh and Hue.</li>
                <li>Oppose+Bases gained 7 from 23 to 30.</li>
                <li>COIN+Patron fell 4 from 44 to 40 (illustration on page 17 is wrong).</li>
                <li>Support+Avail fell 11 from 37 to 26.</li>
                <li>Total wash for the NVA.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3 id="lessons-from-tet">Lessons from Tet</h3>
              
              <p>The Attack procedure is interesting because it highlights the
              preferences for removing pieces. Without the Bots, the attacking faction
              is free to designate enemy targets at will, with the limitation that US
              and ARVN bases must be removed last.</p>
              
              <p>The Bot, however, is going to take the Ranger and Irregular units first,
              then target Troops and Police.</p>
              
              <p>I think it would hard for VC to win without Tet. From the position
              they're in now, they need only gain 7 points to win, and they have
              enough resources to make it difficult for any other faction to reduce
              their score very much, at least in the short term.</p>
              
              <p>Let's continue on with the NVA non-player faction to see what the Bot
              comes up with next. This makes sense to me as I understand Fire in the
              Play as the activity of two factions for every card drawn from the deck.
              Tet's next faction is NVA, which is eligible.</p>
              
              <h2 id="nva-operation--special-activity">NVA Operation + Special Activity</h2>
              
              <p>Now, on to the Non-Player NVA Bot chart.</p>
              
              <h3 id="attack">Attack</h3>
              
              <p>Examining the first decision (top left diamond on the flowchart), Troop
              attack is the highest priority. Examining the board, there are NVA
              guerrillas in Quang Tri and in Tay Ninh, but no NVA Troops sharing any
              space with enemies. The question asks whether an attack by these
              guerrillas will have any effect.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><em>Add COIN or remove Base</em>: Both Quang Tri and Tay Ninh have US bases
              and are coin control, but there aren't enough NVA in either space to
              remove either COIN or Base. See last item in this list.</li>
                <li><em>Last COIN</em>: I don't know what this means.</li>
                <li><em>Remove 4+ enemies from space</em>: This is clearly "no" in both Quang Tri
              where 3 NVA guerrillas could only remove 1 US, and in Tay Ninh where 2
              NVA guerrillas could only remove 1 US.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3 id="terror">Terror</h3>
              
              <p>This is a no-go as only Quang Tri and Tay Ninh have the requisite
              guerillas, but Tay Ninh is already in Active Opposition, and adding
              Terror to Quang Tri only affects 2 population.</p>
              
              <h3 id="rallymarch">Rally/March</h3>
              
              <p>There are three conditions in governing Rally or March for the NVA Bot:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Are there more than 20 Troops in the NVA Available box? (<strong>yes</strong>)</li>
                <li>Are there more than 10 guerrillas in the NVA Available box? (<strong>no</strong>)</li>
                <li>Is the Trail less than 2? (<strong>no</strong>)</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Answering "yes" to any of the above means Rally/Infiltrate, otherwise March.</p>
              
              <h4 id="rally">Rally</h4>
              
              <p>Since there are more than 20 Troops in NVA Available, the NVA will
              Rally. The condition is:</p>
              
              <blockquote>
              In up to 3 non-Support spaces (1 space if unshaded "AAA" and Trail will
              be improved):
              </blockquote>
              
              <p>Followed by these priorities:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Place Bases at 4+ NVA/VC. There are only two spaces with 4+ NVA/VC,
              which are North Vietnam and Central Laos. However, both have only 1
              guerrilla in each, hence, cannot place a Base. There are already bases
              in each in any case.</li>
                <li>Then place Guerrillas at any COIN control in Laos or Cambodia: None.</li>
                <li>Next place Guerrillas at NVA Bases with &lt; 2 NVA Guerrillas, <em>then</em> at
              any NVA Bases, <em>finally</em> randomly. Bases with one NVA guerrilla are in
              North Vietnam and Central Laos, so NVA places one guerrilla in each for
              2 resources.</li>
              </ul>

              Resources.</p>
              
              <h3 id="further-questions">Further questions</h3>
              
              <p>Question 1: If a space has both NVA Underground Guerrilla and NVA Troop
              cube, must the Underground Guerrilla be activated? I read that to be
              yes, as the rules state "if any [Underground Guerrilla] there" for the
              Terror procedure.</p>
              
              <p>Question 2: for the Attacks, does there have to be a VC Guerilla in the
              space along with an NVA Guerrilla?</p>
              
              <p>Question 3: Rule 8.1.2 instructs to remove in reverse order of
              placement. Bases are emplaced first when possible, but the example
              doesn't show the US base in Saigon being removed. This part isn't quite
              clear.</p>
              
              <p>Question 4: Does a VC Base count for Attack value? For example, suppose 2
              VC guerrillas and 1 VC Base are in a province and execute Attack. Do the
              VC count 2 or 3 for the purposes of the die roll?</p>
              
              <p>Question 5: NVA Bot flowchart says "Troop" in the control of flow
              diamond, but shows <em>NVA Troops, Guerrillas</em> in the action box to the
              right. NVA player aid indicates guerrillas may attack as well. Is this
              diaomond misworded?</p>
              
              <p>Question 6: Suppose for an NVA Rally there is already a single base
              which is NVA in the space, and the space is eligible for a base given
              the constraints of 4+ NVA/VC with 2 NVA guerrillas. Should the base be
              emplaced in that space? As a player, I wouldn't do it.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
