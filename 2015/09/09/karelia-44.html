                Karelia '44
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep  9 2015</time>
              <p>Karelia '44 is my first Standard Combat Series (SCS) game. The SCS
              somewhat resembles Operational Combat Series (OCS) by having
              exploitation and supply phases. Karelia also has a reaction phase for
              the Finns, but not the Russians. Supply is limited to trace supply.
              Overall, the rules are much, much simpler than OCS, while still
              maintaining a certain amount of the same flavor.</p>

              <h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the game</h2>
              
              <p>Two main aspects of Karelia require some attention:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>The Soviets have <em>Prepared</em> offensives (K 2.6).</li>
                <li>The Finns have a combined movement and barrage capability (K 3.4).</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Each of these capabilities require a bit more thought to employ
              effectively, especially as the Soviets can start the game with a
              prepared offensive.</p>
              
              <h3 id="prepared-offensive-for-turn-1">Prepared Offensive for Turn 1</h3>
              
              <p>The following discusses what the Soviets will be doing as part of their
              Turn 1 Prepared Offensive. Getting this out of the way now will help the
              game play go a lot faster.</p>
              
              <p>For a Prepared Offensive, the Soviet player may:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Use Prepared Offensive shift on CRT for both regular and overrun (K 2.6d)</li>
                <li>Low Odds restriction is lifted (K 2.6e).</li>
                <li>Make up to 6 barrages on the Massive Barrage table (2.6f), however
              these barrages must be spotted. No regular Soviet artillery unit may
              fire during Massive Barrage turn, but a single hex can be targeted
              with up to two Massive Barrages (2.6f).</li>
                <li>Non-exploitation capable units (stacks) may exploit as part of a "2nd Wave,"
              which is denoted by the provided markers (K 2.7). Stacks may not be
              in EZOC and in 2nd Wave. 2nd Waves are constrained by the number of
              marker counters. 2nd Wave stacks can move, but may not barrage or
              combat or enter EZOC until released into Exploitation Phase (K 2.7b).</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>So the upshot appears to be the following:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Figure out which units can be 2nd Wave.</li>
                <li>Determine appropriate Massive Barrage targets.</li>
              </ul>

              For this turn, the Soviets will conduct their prepared offensive against

                <li>7/2 defending with 12 in hex 48.05. Soviets attacking with 9, 1:1
              odds. Roll 7 on 4:1 (1R PO + 2R air) is <code>D2r1</code>. This removes the
              ghost unit from 49.06.</li>
                <li>Er 12/2 and 49/2 defending with 16 in hex 50.07, Soviets attacking
              with 18, 1:1 odds. This could have been 4:1 if this unit was DG'ed.
              Roll 3 on 4:1 is <code>A2D1</code>.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>The Soviets rolled really shitty. This could be a short game. On the
              other hand, the Soviets did make a hole in the line, and at least some
              of the second wave units will be able to advance up to the line.</p>
              
              <h4 id="supply-phase-2">Supply Phase</h4>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">Use SCS Supply Rules (SCS 12.0). Soviet non-HQ units must be supplied by HQ
              unit which must itself be in trace supply (K 1.4a). Trace supply for Soviets is
              any road, track or railroad running off map south of Finnish MLR (K
              1.4d).  Attack, defense and movement are 1/2 and out of supply artillery may not
              barrage (K 1.4c).</p>
              
              <p>Soviets are all definitely still in supply this turn.</p>
              
              <h4 id="finnish-reaction-phase-1">Finnish Reaction Phase</h4>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">Any Finnish unit not in an EZOC at the moment it chooses to move can
              move in the Reaction Phase during the Soviet player's turn, including
              disorganized (DG) and out-of-supply units (K 3.5, see also 3.4).</p>
              
              <p>The Finns have a hard decision to make here. The MLR is excellent for
              defense, but the amount of Soviet artillery even without Massive Barrage
              will ensure the Line is lost within another couple of turns. Since the
              Line has already been breached, it's probably best to pull back to the
              VT Line. However, K 3.4 allows movement and barrage by eligible units
              (in this case artillery units). Probably the best thing is to try to DG
              as many forward Soviet units as possible, focusing on the Gaurds units,
              then pull everything off the MLR and attempt to outrun the Soviets to
              the VT.</p>
              
              <p>First, move eligible artillery to single out 63 Guards. Roll 2d6 for a
              4, which is miss, needed a 5 or better. Dang. And it turns out these
              units will now be exposed to exploitation because they moved then fired.
              Would have been better to fire, then move.</p>
              
              <p>Ok, this turned into a total blunder. Given the Finns lost the movement
              for the artillery, they should have held the line instead of bolting for
              the VT. Holding the MLR through the exploitation phase would have
              stymied the Soviet exploitation and 2d Wave, and the units could have as
              easily moved back during their movement turn. Since their movement
              factors are higher than most Soviet units movement factor, in a race to
              VT, the Finns would mostly win. And where they didn't win, the Soviets
              would be exposing armor.</p>
              
              <p>Here's the situation at the end of the Finnish reaction phase.</p>

              <p>Note another blunder here: the Finnish units which are DG'ed moved their
              full movement instead of half their movement allowance.</p>

              <code>A1D1</code>, which eliminates the 9/10.</li>
                <li>The 1 attacking Grp Artillery at 7:1 roll 11 for <code>D3r3</code>.</li>
                <li>31 and 260 Gd attacking 15/2, roll 3, again, <code>A1D1</code>. That really
              hurts the Soviets as those Guard units are single step.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p><strong>As it turns out, this was a blunder as it costs 3 MF for armor and
              motorized to move through forest hexes. Along with the +4 to enter an
              EZOC and overrun, possibly only one, maybe two of these artillery units would have
              lost. But the game must go on…</strong></p>
              
              <p>Next, the 2d Wave units can move up. This turned out well for the
              Soviets since the MLR was abandoned. Soviets get a Boss Point back.</p>

              any unit absorbs two step losses (SCS 8.0b).</li>
                <li>Soviet units cannot attack from more than 2 hexes with exception of
              Guards units (K 2.5a).</li>
                <li>No more than 3 Soviet artillery may fire in a single barrage (K 2.5b).</li>
                <li>Only Exploit-capable and Guards units may overrun (K 2.5c).</li>
                <li>Soviets attacks at less than 2:1 are no effect, exception for Prepared
              Offensive (K 2.5d).</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>At 30.04, Vammalsuu, we have 15:6 which is 3:1 in the Soviets favor,
              with shift 2R for both Air Points, roll 2d6 for 12! Boxcars! The Finns
              collapse! This is a <code>D3r3</code> result, and the Finns only have 2 steps
              available. This would have been 6:1 anyway, with the Prepared Offensive
              shift 1R.</p>
              
              <p>Next hex north, 20:11 which 2:1 + 1R for Prepared Offensive is 3:1 roll
              2d6 for 9, <code>D2r2</code>. The Finns have 4 steps here, need to take 2 loss and
              retreat 2.</p>
              
              <p>Third battle is 21:8 which 3:1 rounded + 1R is 4:1 roll 2d6 for 10
              resulting in <code>D2r2</code>. There were only 2 steps here, so these Finnish
              units are gone.</p>
              
              <p>Fourth battle: 3:1 roll 2d6 for 7 resulting in <code>A1D1r1</code>.</p>
              
              <p>Lastly, 2:1 on the most northwest position, roll 2d6 for 6, <code>A1D1</code> but
              the Soviets can well afford it.</p>
              
              <h3 id="supply-phase-8">Supply Phase</h3>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">Use SCS Supply Rules (SCS 12.0). Soviet non-HQ units must be supplied by HQ
              unit which must itself be in trace supply (K 1.4a). Trace supply for Soviets is
              any road, track or railroad running off map south of Finnish MLR (K
              1.4d).  Attack, defense and movement are 1/2 and out of supply artillery may not
              barrage (K 1.4c).</p>
              
              <p>All Soviet units are in supply.</p>
              
              <h4 id="finnish-reaction-phase-4">Finnish Reaction Phase</h4>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">Any Finnish unit not in an EZOC at the moment it chooses to move can
              move in the Reaction Phase during the Soviet player's turn, including
              disorganized (DG) and out-of-supply units (K 3.5, see also 3.4).</p>
              
              <p>It's not apparent that there is anything the Finns can do to prevent a
              Soviet win at this point. There is only one VT Line hex which is still
              occupied by the Finns, and they could likely keep it for another couple
              of turns, at the risk of being encircled. Even if the reinforcements
              come in on the Finns turn, it's too little too late, as they have too
              far to travel to make a significant difference, that is, kick the
              Soviets off the VT line.</p>
              
              <p>Finns concede.</p>
              
              <h3 id="end-of-turn-for-and-game">End of Turn for and Game</h3>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Soviet victory" src="/images/karelia44/g1-end.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>The situation after the second Soviet Prepared Offensive shows the Finns
              in desperate straits.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>For this scenario (Scenario 2), it's critical that the Finns retreat to
              the VT Line in good order. The Soviet machine is massive, a juggernaut,
              and the Finns need to slow it down as much as possible to run the clock.</p>
              
              <p>It should be pointed out that in this game, the dice really didn't work
              for the Finns at all. Had the luck been a little more even, the game
              probably would have gone into a Turn 5 or 6, or possibly longer.</p>
              
              <p>This one of those games where it needs to be played a few times to see
              how the strategies and luck work together. Despite the Finns being
              stomped, I can see how they could do really well. They have very strong
              defense, more movement factors, are more robust on combat results
              against attacker, and have more flexible reaction and exploitation. That
              said, they need to be played well or none of that matters. Which makes
              for a good game in my world.</p>
              
              <p>One thing which isn't all that realistic that the Massive Barrage can be
              conducted when the majority of the artillery units are (for whatever
              reason) out of normal barrage range. The rules don't make any provision
              for this, and for this game I just rolled with it, but it's still a bit
              troublesome. It probably doesn't matter because if the artillery isn't
              in range enough to barrage normally, the Massive Barrage won't have as
              much effect.</p>
              
              <p>Ghost units do ont enforce a ZOC, they simply prevent the Soviets from
              entering a particular hex in a defensive line. One weakness in this
              system is there is no given way to denote which ghost hexes are
              "emplaced" by which units. This is important because when the emplacing
              unit leaves the line, so do all "attached" ghost units.</p>
              
              <p>House-ruled clarifications:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>The rules weren't clear to me whether the ghost units provided an EZOC
              which would deny Soviet 2d Wave unit designation, but it seemed
              reasonable that they would, given the intent of the ghost units.
              Hence, Soviet units in ghost EZOC not eligible for 2d Wave.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Artillery participating in Massive Barrage during Prepared Offensive
              is unable to participate in 2d wave. This is because they would
              ordinarily be unable to fire if denoted 2d wave during regular barrage
              phase. The rules seem unclear here, but it makes sense to me that any
              unit involved in a Massive Barrage is going to be too busy to move.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Setting up exploitation capable units in EZOCs, which means they will
              unable to move and fight during exploitation phase. This may be partly
              mitigated by moving them out of EZOC during movement phase, will need
              to check with the rules whether unit can move in both phases.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Putting too many units under 2d Wave markers during first Prepared
              Offensive. Those units are needed during the initial combat round on
              Turn 1.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Massive Barrage on too few Finnish units in MLR on first turn. The
              Massive Barrage is a guaranteed DG, which halves the defense strength,
              which is <em>really</em> important against units in MLR.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Moving, then firing Finnish artillery during the first turn reaction
              phase. These units should have fired from where they were, then moved
              back to not get overrun during Soviet exploitation phase.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>DG movement is half regular, which was not observed by the Finns in
              the first turn reaction phase, as can be seen in the photo above.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>HUGE BLUNDER: mechanized is 3 MF/hex in forest. This would probably
              have saved the Finnish artillery which was overrun, the armor would
              not have had enough MF to pay the +2 for entering the EZOC along with
              another +2 for conducting overrun. Oh well.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Forgot to pay the +3 for crossing a river for the Finns on retreat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>I've been moving all Soviet artillery as mechanized, which isn't
              correct. Only the yellow background units are motorized. The units
              with no color background move as leg. This is helpful as the roads
              would get overly clogged, and some of the artillery would otherwise be
              limited to one hex of movement per turn.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>It's not just about strength in defensive positions. The critical
              psoitions need to be able to soak up enough step losses to survive
              without retreating, otherwise the line falls. With too few step
              losses, the risk is having defenders eliminated.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3 id="the-next-game">The next game</h3>
              
              <p>Some thoughts about what I intend on doing for a next game, based on the
              lessons learned during this game:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Allow room on the first turn to bring in 6 units of reinforcements.</li>
                <li>Ensure the enough combat capable, non-artillery can get to the MLR on
              the first turn to take advantage of DG'ed Finnish units from Massive
              Barrage.</li>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.

              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>

                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>

                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."

                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
