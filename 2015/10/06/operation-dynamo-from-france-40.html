                Operation Dynamo from France '40
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Oct  6 2015</time>
              <p>France '40 is a pretty good deal: two games in the box! I've already
              played <a href="/2015/03/08/sickle-cut-first-play.html">Sickle Cut</a> a couple of
              times, now it's time to check out the other game in the box, Operation
              Dynamo.</p>
              
              <p>This scenario simulates the BEF's withdrawal from Dunkirk, but even more
              importantly, it shows what the French had to do to allow the British to
              withdraw. That's not something I've read much about. Given the game is a
              reasonable simulation in terms of order of battle and initial position
              of forces, the French performed admirably to allow so much of the
              British force to evacuate at Dunkirk.</p>
              
              <p>In my opinion, the game is worth playing for this alone.</p>
              
              <hr />
              
              <h2 id="turn-1-may-24-1940">Turn 1, May 24, 1940</h2>
              
              <p>This being the beginning of the game, the only thing which needs done is
              rolling to remove the Halt! orders on two panzer divisions. In this case
              8 Pz and 4 Pz are freed up.</p>
              
              <p>Since I haven't played this scenario yet, I'm not sure what the Germans
              need to do exactly. Short term is to take Calais.</p>
              
              <h3 id="german-player-turn-1">German Player Turn 1</h3>
              
              <p>Germans will attempt to pinch off the Allied salient by squeezing with
              panzer divisions from the southwest and the IDs from the east.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-initial-phase">German Initial Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Air units flipped.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-movement-phase">German Movement Phase</h4>
              
              <p>As noted above, the IDs squeeze from the east, while the armored and
              motorized infantry squeeze from the southwest. Inparticular, Rommel's 7
              Pz is in position to force a break in the line near the village of
              Hazebrouck, supported by SS Verf. division. Getting a breakthrough here
              could cut off the Allied retreat. In the east, the situation is more
              complicated, with a higher density of Belgian units. There won't be a
              fast push into the hinterland, but it may force the Belgians to retreat
              to firm up their line.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-combat-phase">German Combat Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Highlights:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Remember to use armor shift in the open.</li>
                <li>1 Pz tank eliminated by defenders at Calais.</li>
                <li>Rommel punched through, probably had a defender step loss but I think
              I read the odds table wrong. That would have allowed an overrun. No
              big deal, we'll see how it plays out.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4 id="german-recovery-phase">German Recovery Phase</h4>
              
              <p>No disruption markers.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-supply-phase">German Supply Phase</h4>
              
              <p>All good in supply.</p>
              
              <h3 id="allied-player-turn-1">Allied Player Turn 1</h3>
              
              <p>Allies are going to try and pull back while limiting the German advance.
              The French are gonna get hosed, I can see it now.</p>
              
              <h4 id="allied-initial-phase">Allied Initial Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Big question: use air for offense or defense?</p>
              
              <h4 id="allied-movement-phase">Allied Movement Phase</h4>
              
              <p>So I moved all the Allied forces back, then read the victory conditions
              whereby getting forces off the south edge of the map also counts. That
              would have changed my movement a little bit I think.</p>
              
              <h4 id="allied-combat-phase">Allied Combat Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Allies are definitely taking a stand against 8 Pz! 6:1 with Allied
              aricraft back in play; the German aircraft are still out. But 5:1 with
              the Rommel shift. Rollem: 5 for <code>D1</code>, 8 Pz goes for Determined
              Defense, which turns out to be a bad idea because the it holds with a
              step loss for the lead unit. This takes 8 Pz out of the game. Bummer
              for the Germans. Also bummer for the remains of 7 Pz, as they are badly
              exposed, but could have retreated (albeit with losing panzer brigade).</p>
              
              <h4 id="allied-recovery-phase">Allied Recovery Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Nothing to recover.</p>
              
              <h4 id="allied-supply-phase">Allied Supply Phase</h4>
              
              <p>All in supply. <strong>Halt!</strong> markers placed then removed from 5 and 8 Pz.</p>
              
              <h3 id="end-phase-of-turn-1">End Phase of Turn 1</h3>

              <h2 id="turn-2-may-25-1940">Turn 2, May 25, 1940</h2>
              
              <p>The Germans got a bad break, or possibly, got what they deserved for
              their hastiness, with 8 Pz getting gutted. The Allies probably need to
              consider getting some of the French off the south side of the map.
              Otherwise, business as usual: the Germans attempt to pinch off the
              salient, while the Allies bolt down the closing corridor.</p>
              
              <h3 id="german-player-turn-2">German Player Turn 2</h3>
              
              <p>Continue to squeeze. Two more turns and the <strong>Halt!</strong> markers come off.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-initial-phase-1">German Initial Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Air units flipped.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-movement-phase-1">German Movement Phase</h4>
              
              <p>As before, squeezing from both sides to put some serious pressure on the
              Allies.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-combat-phase-1">German Combat Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Combat result against Belgians:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>2:1 roll 6 <code>D1</code>.</li>
                <li>3:1 roll 3 <code>DR</code> with DD roll 2 but low TQ hence lose step and
              retreat.</li>
                <li>3:1 roll 4 <code>DR</code>.</li>
                <li>5:1 roll 6 <code>DS</code>.</li>
                <li>6:1 roll 5 <code>DS</code>.</li>
                <li>3:1 roll 3 <code>DR</code> with DD roll 4 no effect.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Bad news for the Belgians.</p>
              
              <p>Now against the French, two retreat results with no steps losses for
              either side.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-recovery-phase-1">German Recovery Phase</h4>
              
              <p>No Germans disrupted.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-supply-phase-1">German Supply Phase</h4>
              
              <p>All German units in supply.</p>

              <p>This is a make or break turn for the Allies. They need to shore up a
              line around Dunkirk else the Germans are going to cut them off.</p>
              
              <h4 id="allied-initial-phase-1">Allied Initial Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Air units flipped.</p>

              <h4 id="allied-combat-phase-1">Allied Combat Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Two attacks. The first against the remains of 8 Pz with Verf. sort of
              failed with an <code>EX</code> result. Really needed a defender retreat here.</p>
              
              <h4 id="allied-recovery-phase-1">Allied Recovery Phase</h4>

              <p><strong>Halt!</strong> markers placed, and removed from 5 and 8 Pz, so, no change as
              it turns out.</p>
              
              <h3 id="end-phase-of-turn-2">End Phase of Turn 2</h3>
              
              <p>It does not look good for the Allies. The French bolting to the south
              really opens it up for swarming, and since they didn't break through,
              they're just going to get starved out by attrition.</p>
              
              <hr />
              
              <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
              
              <p>The British are likely cursing the French who attempted to bolt to the
              south and will probably get trapped, because that's one the main
              objectives for this turn for the Germans: run the entrapped French out
              of supply, and attrit them away. In the north, the Germans will continue
              to pressure the Belgians, who will continue to resist. Not resist well,
              but resist none-the-less. Over in the west, the front around Lille has
              opened up a bit. The Germans don't want to get counterattacked by full
              strength Biritsh and French units. Might as well wait until the panzers
              come active. The Allies will use this breathing room to further
              consolidate.</p>
              
              <h3 id="german-player-turn-3">German Player Turn 3</h3>
              
              <p>As noted above, encircling the French in the south should get some free
              kills by attrition. But don't want to tie up too many infantry here,
              they will be needed once the panzers start to withdraw.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-initial-phase-2">German Initial Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Air units ready.</p>

              <p>Reinforcement enter south of Lille, and move into the open area between
              the lines.</p>
              
              <p>The French in the south are now encircled. The units in Valenciennes
              will still be in supply, but the others to the west will not be in
              supply.</p>
              
              <p>Much pressure on the Belgians.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-combat-phase-2">German Combat Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Mostly in the north, against the Belgians, which went fairly well.
              Against the Brits in Armentieres, 5 Pz lost a step on a Determined
              Defense, but an adjacent Advance After Combat probably trapped those
              defenders.</p>

              <p>Allied player now in a real bind as the Germans are penetrating into the
              rear areas closer to Dunkirk. May have to abandon units trapped in
              Armentieres. The rest will pull back to tighten up the line, make it
              smaller, hopefully harder to penetrate.</p>

              <p>Allies make a crescent-shaped perimeter around Dunkirk, about 3-4 hexes
              out, to have room for retreating. 23 and 46 BEF ID abandoned in
              Armentieres. French still trying to break out of the south.</p>
              
              <h4 id="allied-combat-phase-2">Allied Combat Phase</h4>
              
              <p>Took a shot at 8 Pz mechanized units with Verf. at 4:1, roll 1 for <code>EX</code>,
              which is the worst result on that column. Actually, it's not that bad as
              it eliminated the SS Verf., which is a VP for the Allies. Which is
              actually wrong again, Verf. goes to Remnant.</p>
              
              <p>The French managed to break out in the south, the Germans have to decide

              <p>With panzers in motion and the infantry pushing hard on the Belgians, the
              battle is now split between what's going on around Dunkirk, and a sideshow
              south of Duoai. The French just might escape. Around Dunkirk, all the
              panzer divisions are lined up abreast. If I were the Brit, I'd be crapping
              trousers about right now.</p>
              
              <p>The Germans pretty much have to break through on this turn or the next,
              because panzers start getting pulled for refit on Turn 6.</p>
              
              <h4 id="german-combat-phase-3">German Combat Phase</h4>
              
              <p>This is a complex combat turn for the Germans.</p>
              
              <p>Here's an interesting situation:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Can the French retreat or not?" src="/images/france40/french_retreat.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>What the Germans are going to do here is use the REM E in Cambrai along with the reduced
              32 ID to attack 12 ID and 5 NA at 1:1 odds. If they get a retreat (50% chance)
              as I read the rules the French would be eliminated, even though they are right
              on the edge of the map, and would exit on their next turn anyway. This sort of
              makes sense in this particular situation as either  hex the French could move
              into would be an EZOC, implied in the imaginary, off map hex southwest Cambrai.
              Germans roll a 4, which is an <code>EX</code>, which puts German 32 ID and French 12 ID into
              remnant mode, and leaving the French to exit during their turn.</p>
              
              <p>However, it also turns out from the Section 12.1 in the rules that 12 and 5 could
              retreat through 4 ID, as it negates EZOCs for retreat purposes.</p>
              
              <p>Now the 8 ID goes for the French 4 ID at 1:1, rolls a 6 for <code>A1D1</code>.
              German 8 ID is reduced, French 4 ID goes to remnant and retreats to
              3126.  This unit is not likely to get off the board as a couple of other
              German IDs are in position to catch it. However, it's not clear yet
              whether that German infantry would be better served up around Ypres.</p>
              
              <p>In the northeast, the Belgians, as usual, are getting slaughtered.</p>
              
              <p>Panzer time.</p>
              
              <p>And whoa! Crappy results for the panzers! A <code>D1</code> and 2 <code>EX</code>! Rommel is reduced!
              Bummer for the Germans. This is going to make it hard for them as it lets
              the Brits swing their motorized around to the south of Dunkirk to shore up
              the defenses.</p>

              <p>The Allies managed to hold against the panzers. Now, it's super critical
              they redeploy their strong mechanized units to hold a perimeter allowing
              as many Brits to get off at Dunkirk as possible. The conundrum of course being
              that these same mech units need to evacuate at some point.</p>
              
              <p>They should also keep an eye out for ensuring whatever French remain stay
              in supply, which is traced to a friendly port.</p>

                <li>Remaining French and British drawing up tight around Dunkirk, but with just
              enough room to retreat 2 if necessary.</li>
                <li>2 French units managed to escape off the south of the map.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>Big blunder here: For some reason the Turn Track marker was on Turn 5, but
              it's actually Turn 4, and I've pulled the Belgians off the map. I'm going to
              play it out anyway, at least for a few more turns, just to see what happens.
              I think the Brits are in a pretty strong position anyway.</strong></p>
              
              <p><strong>Another blunder: beach evacuation doesn't start until Turn 5. So this might

              little bit. Attackers are prepared to lose a step.</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>3 Pz defending: 28:6 is 4:1, 1L for elite, armor shifts cancel, we'll go with
              3:1 and put the air on the other fight. Roll 3, <code>DR</code>. No big deal either way, buys
              a turn maybe for the Allies as 3 Pz needs to recover from disruption.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>8 Pz defending, in polder so no armor shift, TQ shift 1L, Air shift 1R for 1:1

                <li>
                  <p>Out of supply units make a 1:1 attack on northwest of Cambrai, roll 6
              for <code>D1</code>, which is against a remnant unit, which is a VP and they get to
              advance after combat. This gets 2 NA and 25 ID off the board, with remnant
              French right at the board's edge. The Germans will have to deal with this

              <p>The IDs around Douai and Valenciennes split up. Some go north to pressure

              <p>A mass of infantry is bearing down on Monty. They will attack at probably
              somewhat low odds, but have a good chance at driving Monty back.</p>

              to shift 1L, the panzers are much more dangerous in advance after combat.
              So, 3:1, roll 4 yields <code>DR</code> Rommel will take it. Sadly for the Germans, the
              perimeter is too tight for them to break through, ZOC bonds both east and

              are going to attempt to take Dunkirk to prevent any more evacuations.
              Then again, the Allies have put up a pretty good fight, so they might
              get 15 VP without getting 10 Brits off at Dunkirk.</p>

              <p>Hitler is now starting to call back some of the panzer divisions for
              use in further south, so the Germans really have to push very hard this
              turn to eliminate or push back the Brits and occupy Dunkirk. The Brits
              just need to hold off this turn and the next, and everything should get
              a lot easier, they should be able to get 5 more units evacuated.</p>

              eliminated, that unit goes to remnant. I'm not sure why that was a good
              idea, except that there won't be a retreat, which is good.</p>
              
              <p>Second up is 4 and 5 Pz attacking at 14:13 with 1R TQ and 2R air, with
              the Brits defending with 1L air for 3:1; roll 5 for <code>A1D1</code>; Determined

              <p>It's almost over for the Allies. Hopefully, they will be able to evacuate
              3 units this turn from Dunkirk, which should put them very close to sudden

              certainly get it next turn, as there is no way the Germans will be able to

              one each in the beach hexes. Around Dunkirk and the beach hexes is a solid
              perimeter of Allied units which will almost surely break next turn, but

              <p>The key to the Allied victory here was getting five French units
              off the map to the south. This allowed the sudden death condition
              of 15 or more Allied units evacuated.</p>
              
              <p>The victory points otherwise look like the following:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>14 Allied evacuated from Dunkirk or via south edge.</li>
                <li>8 French units still in supply on the map. This would
              decrease by 2 or 3 next turn for sure.</li>
                <li>4 German units eliminated.</li>
                <li>-6 for eliminated and still on the map British units.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>This totals to 20 VPs, clear allied win.</p>
              
              <p>If the Germans were able to prevent another British unit from
              evacuating, and had prevented French escape to the south, this
              would be a different story.</p>
              
              <p>It might have been interesting to play it out another couple of
              turns, but I want to get something else on the table, possibly
              even something new.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>1 Pz came out from under Halt! and decided to attack Calais…at
              reduced strength. This was probably a bad idea as the tank brigade was
              eliminated in the combat. It would have been better to wait for a turn
              where 1 Pz stayed under Halt! and then got a replacement. It's not
              like 30 Inf Brigade is going to move from Calais. They'd get
              slaughtered without the double defense from the city hex. Actually,
              this doesn't matter because 1 Pz doesn't get a Halt! marker until
              Calais is cleared. More thought is necessary here.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>VP for Allies includes exiting from the south side of the map, which
              makes sense historically (and illustrates the difficulty with this
              game attempting to run a combined campaign scenario between Sickle Cut
              and Dynamo). I didn't take this into account on my first turn moves
              for the Allies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Forgot to bring in the German 251 ID for reinforcement on Turn 5.
              This might have helped prevent French retreat to the south, so it
              definitely counts as a blunder. The rules aren't clear whether the
              reinforcement can enter at a later turn in the condition where it
              is not blocked by EZOC, etc. I would rule that allowing any entry
              on a later turn implies allowing all entry on later turns, whether
              specifically blocked or not. Would be a good question for the forum.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.

                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.

                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
