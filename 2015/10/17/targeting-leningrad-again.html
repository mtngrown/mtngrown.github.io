                Targeting Leningrad, again
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Oct 17 2015</time>
              <p>Continuing my cycle of new games and hard games and short games, I'm
              following France '40 up with Target Leningrad. This will be my second
              play. Most of the rules are familiar from Battle for Moscow and
              Objective Kiev. I seem to learn something new every time I play these
              games, especially when I play solo and work very carefully through the
              rules as I play.</p>
              
              <p>I'm not really planning on doing a blow-by-blow, but I will illustrate
              specific situations which would be useful for playing against opponents.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p>Germans open with a bang:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="German get a very nice result from first
              combat" src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-german-combat.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>The first combats were to take out the Soviet Mechanized forces,
              both of which suffered from high odds and being single step. So
              they go back into the replacement pool.</p>
              
              <p>The third battle was 56 Panzer Corps taking on a full strength Soviet
              army, in this case, the 11th. The odds were 2:1 with 1R for German air
              and a roll of 5 for <code>EX</code>. Because German 1st Corps and 41st Corps had
              already advanced, the 11th Army was subjected to a second step loss
              retreating through either EZOC, hence, to the replacement pool for that.</p>
              
              <p>For a bit of lagniappe, 10th Corps attacked 34th Army, rolling a 3 for
              an <code>EX</code> and forcing a retreat. While it's sad to lose 2 steps in a
              single combat as the Germans, it's probably worth it as there is nothing
              in the Germans way for an advance to Leningrad.</p>
              
              <p>The Soviets are surely in the hurt loacker here. For special movement,
              the mechanized move to Leningrad. No combat interest for Soviets this
              turn. For regular movement, all units move east as far as possible, with
              the intention of impeding the German advance with EZOCs, etc. Kind of
              speed bump technique, but I think that's what the Soviets actually
              had to do.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
              
              <p>German panzers knocking on Leningrad's door. They really swooped fast.</p>
              
              <p>However, the Russians aren't rolling over. They're making it tough on
              the Panzers which are way, way out in front of the infantry support.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of Turn 2" src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t2.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Germans are close to Leningrad, but about to get into some serious
              trouble. There is a lot of game left to go.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
              
              <p>Mostly positioning, Germans chewing away at the infantry trapped
              behind the front:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of Turn 3" src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t3.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Germans are going to attempt to cut off the east edge Soviet entry
              point. This is where I'd like to have some breakdown units for the
              Germans.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of Turn 4" src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t4.jpg" /></p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of Turn 5" src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t5.jpg" /></p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of Turn 6" src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t6.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Note that the Russian are in a real bind as they cannot add replacement
              strength to a unit which is in a German EZOC.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of Turn 7" src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t7.jpg" /></p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h2>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="End of game" src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-end.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>End result: draw, as Leningrad is forced into isolation from EZOC
              established by 1 Infantry Corps.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>Unlike Battle for Moscow, Soviet units "behind the lines" pose a much
              greater threat to the Germans. In that game, it's not necessary to
              eliminate Soviet units behind the lines as there are enough German
              units to isolate from communication, and they can't get replacements.
              In this game, Soviet units left behind can occupy cities which the
              Germans have passed, thus spoiling German victory conditions.</p>
              
              <h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Replacement on German panzer when in ezoc. In this case I don't think it
              mattered as the corps could have moved one hex off, replaced, moved
              back.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Both panzer corps attacking through same hex side. While this did
              eliminate a soviet army, it probably wasn't very effective.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Germans should have attacked Leningrad on Turn 6, as soon as they
              could get a 2:1, maybe even a 1:1.</p>
                </li>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
