Targeting Leningrad, again
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Oct 17 2015</time>
<p>Continuing my cycle of new games and hard games and short games, I'm
following France '40 up with Target Leningrad. This will be my second
play. Most of the rules are familiar from Battle for Moscow and
Objective Kiev. I seem to learn something new every time I play these
games, especially when I play solo and work very carefully through the
rules as I play.</p>

<p>I'm not really planning on doing a blow-by-blow, but I will illustrate
specific situations which would be useful for playing against opponents.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Germans open with a bang:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-german-combat.jpg" alt="German get a very nice result from first
combat" /></p>

<p>The first combats were to take out the Soviet Mechanized forces,
both of which suffered from high odds and being single step. So
they go back into the replacement pool.</p>

<p>The third battle was 56 Panzer Corps taking on a full strength Soviet
army, in this case, the 11th. The odds were 2:1 with 1R for German air
and a roll of 5 for <code>EX</code>. Because German 1st Corps and 41st Corps had
already advanced, the 11th Army was subjected to a second step loss
retreating through either EZOC, hence, to the replacement pool for that.</p>

<p>For a bit of lagniappe, 10th Corps attacked 34th Army, rolling a 3 for
an <code>EX</code> and forcing a retreat. While it's sad to lose 2 steps in a
single combat as the Germans, it's probably worth it as there is nothing
in the Germans way for an advance to Leningrad.</p>

<p>The Soviets are surely in the hurt loacker here. For special movement,
the mechanized move to Leningrad. No combat interest for Soviets this
turn. For regular movement, all units move east as far as possible, with
the intention of impeding the German advance with EZOCs, etc. Kind of
speed bump technique, but I think that's what the Soviets actually
had to do.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>German panzers knocking on Leningrad's door. They really swooped fast.</p>

<p>However, the Russians aren't rolling over. They're making it tough on
the Panzers which are way, way out in front of the infantry support.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t2.jpg" alt="End of Turn 2" /></p>

<p>Germans are close to Leningrad, but about to get into some serious
trouble. There is a lot of game left to go.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Mostly positioning, Germans chewing away at the infantry trapped
behind the front:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t3.jpg" alt="End of Turn 3" /></p>

<p>Germans are going to attempt to cut off the east edge Soviet entry
point. This is where I'd like to have some breakdown units for the
Germans.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t4.jpg" alt="End of Turn 4" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t5.jpg" alt="End of Turn 5" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t6.jpg" alt="End of Turn 6" /></p>

<p>Note that the Russian are in a real bind as they cannot add replacement
strength to a unit which is in a German EZOC.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-t7.jpg" alt="End of Turn 7" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g2-end.jpg" alt="End of game" /></p>

<p>End result: draw, as Leningrad is forced into isolation from EZOC
established by 1 Infantry Corps.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Unlike Battle for Moscow, Soviet units "behind the lines" pose a much
greater threat to the Germans. In that game, it's not necessary to
eliminate Soviet units behind the lines as there are enough German
units to isolate from communication, and they can't get replacements.
In this game, Soviet units left behind can occupy cities which the
Germans have passed, thus spoiling German victory conditions.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Replacement on German panzer when in ezoc. In this case I don't think it
mattered as the corps could have moved one hex off, replaced, moved
back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both panzer corps attacking through same hex side. While this did
eliminate a soviet army, it probably wasn't very effective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Germans should have attacked Leningrad on Turn 6, as soon as they
could get a 2:1, maybe even a 1:1.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
