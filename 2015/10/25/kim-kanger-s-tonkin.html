                Kim Kanger's Tonkin
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Oct 25 2015</time>
              <p>I have a potential opponent lined up for playing "Tonkin The First
              Indochina War." This provides an excellent reason to lay it out for
              some solo play to learn the rules.</p>
              
              <p>The game is published by Legion as an updated version of a similar game
              which appeared several years previously in a Via Victus issue. The
              counters are Legion's easy punch. The map is a bit busy, such the
              counters tend to blend in with the map, making it difficult to
              photograph games in progress. I won't complain about overly busy maps,
              or the "little dudes" on the counters, but I do find such things
              detracts from my experience with a game.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">Recap previous turn, and present challenges for both players for
              this upcoming turn.</p>
              
              <p>Since this is the first game I've played of Tonkin, I have no idea
              what I'm doing, so I'm just going to do it.</p>
              
              <h3 id="replacement--reinforcement-phase-rule-20">Replacement &amp; Reinforcement Phase (rule 2.0):</h3>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence"><code>1</code>. VM receives reinforcement, if the VP level is equal to
              or less than the current VM number (rule 2.1).</p>
              
              <p>No reinforcements this scenario. The <em>Reinforcement Chart</em> (player aid)
              only shows reinforcements for December 1950 in any case.</p>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence"><code>2</code>. VM decides on mix of SD and Replacement Points
              (rule 2.2). Regiments may receive replacements.</p>
              
              <p>For the Na San intro scenario, the VM receive 2 replacement points and
              any points received from 2.2e and 2.2f from occupying FEF or attacking
              FEF positions.</p>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence"><code>3</code>. VM non-motorized regiments may replace steps by
              absorbing Tieu Doans within 2 hexes (rule 2.3).</p>
              
              <p>Nothing for this scenario.</p>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence"><code>4</code>. VM may mobilize an equal number of Tieu Doans
              from Tieu Doan/Pathet Lao Box 2 as half the number
              of VM-friendly VP hexes. Place them within 2 hexes
              of a Vietnamese mobilization center (rule 9.0-2).
              VM may place a Pathet Lao, from the same box, in a
              VM-friendly mobilization center in Laos if there are
              more VM-friendly centers in Laos than there are
              Pathet Laos. Finally, move all units from box 1 to
              box 2 (rule 2.4).</p>
              
              <p>No Tieu Doan this turn (up to 2 in this scenario, must be taken from
              losses).</p>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence"><code>5</code>. FEF receives reinforcement and pays VP, or places
              them on the Turn track (rule 2.5).</p>

              <p class="turn-sequence"><code>6</code>. FEF decides on mix of SD and replacement points
              (rule 2.6). Units may receive replacements.</p>
              
              <p>FEF receives 1 SD to be placed in Hanoi.</p>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence"><code>7</code>. FEF withdraws units (rule 2.7).</p>
              
              <p>No withdrawal for FEF this turn.</p>

              <p class="turn-sequence"><code>8</code>. VM may move all VM units (rules 3.1, 3.8, 4.5, 6.14,
              7.5). Units may double move (rule 3.2) and use
              transports (rules 3.3, 3.4). Units may overrun
              (rule 6.4).</p>
              
              <p>Not doing a lot of movement this turn, as I'm not really getting the
              movement and ZOC rules down very well. However, I have set up the VM to
              attack.</p>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">For Na San only: VM receive 1 SD according to scenario instructions.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>

                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.

                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
