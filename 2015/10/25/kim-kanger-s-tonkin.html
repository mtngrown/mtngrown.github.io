<p>I have a potential opponent lined up for playing "Tonkin The First
Indochina War." This provides an excellent reason to lay it out for
some solo play to learn the rules.</p>

<p>The game is published by Legion as an updated version of a similar game
which appeared several years previously in a Via Victus issue. The
counters are Legion's easy punch. The map is a bit busy, such the
counters tend to blend in with the map, making it difficult to
photograph games in progress. I won't complain about overly busy maps,
or the "little dudes" on the counters, but I do find such things
detracts from my experience with a game.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1-oct-1952">Turn 1, Oct. 1952</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Recap previous turn, and present challenges for both players for
this upcoming turn.</p>

<p>Since this is the first game I've played of Tonkin, I have no idea
what I'm doing, so I'm just going to do it.</p>

<h3 id="replacement--reinforcement-phase-rule-20">Replacement &amp; Reinforcement Phase (rule 2.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>1</code>. VM receives reinforcement, if the VP level is equal to
or less than the current VM number (rule 2.1).</p>

<p>No reinforcements this scenario. The <em>Reinforcement Chart</em> (player aid)
only shows reinforcements for December 1950 in any case.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>2</code>. VM decides on mix of SD and Replacement Points
(rule 2.2). Regiments may receive replacements.</p>

<p>For the Na San intro scenario, the VM receive 2 replacement points and
any points received from 2.2e and 2.2f from occupying FEF or attacking
FEF positions.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>3</code>. VM non-motorized regiments may replace steps by
absorbing Tieu Doans within 2 hexes (rule 2.3).</p>

<p>Nothing for this scenario.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>4</code>. VM may mobilize an equal number of Tieu Doans
from Tieu Doan/Pathet Lao Box 2 as half the number
of VM-friendly VP hexes. Place them within 2 hexes
of a Vietnamese mobilization center (rule 9.0-2).
VM may place a Pathet Lao, from the same box, in a
VM-friendly mobilization center in Laos if there are
more VM-friendly centers in Laos than there are
Pathet Laos. Finally, move all units from box 1 to
box 2 (rule 2.4).</p>

<p>No Tieu Doan this turn (up to 2 in this scenario, must be taken from
losses).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>5</code>. FEF receives reinforcement and pays VP, or places
them on the Turn track (rule 2.5).</p>

<p>No reinforcements this scenario for FEF.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>6</code>. FEF decides on mix of SD and replacement points
(rule 2.6). Units may receive replacements.</p>

<p>FEF receives 1 SD to be placed in Hanoi.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>7</code>. FEF withdraws units (rule 2.7).</p>

<p>No withdrawal for FEF this turn.</p>

<h3 id="vm-player-movement-phase-rule-30">VM Player Movement Phase (rule 3.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>8</code>. VM may move all VM units (rules 3.1, 3.8, 4.5, 6.14,
7.5). Units may double move (rule 3.2) and use
transports (rules 3.3, 3.4). Units may overrun
(rule 6.4).</p>

<p>Not doing a lot of movement this turn, as I'm not really getting the
movement and ZOC rules down very well. However, I have set up the VM to
attack. Basically, just pushed around a few counters towards one of the
VP hexes.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">For Na San only: VM receive 1 SD according to scenario instructions.</p>

<h3 id="fef-player-movement-phase-rule-30">FEF Player Movement Phase (rule 3.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>9</code>. All FEF units may move (rules 3.1, 3.8, 4.1, 4.3, 6.14,
7.5). Units may double move (rule 3.2)
use transports (rules 3.3 - 3.7). Units may overrun
(rule 6.4).</p>

<p>I'm going to have to write out these moves in detail to understand how
movement works in this game. As of this writing, November 23, 2015, I
haven't been able to make any progress on the game in a month. That's
idiotic.</p>

<p>I have the 2/2 REI, the 2/13 and 3/13 DBLE, 1 and 4 GM in Vin Yen (V-14).
I want to move them to Phu Tho (T-14) to attack a stack of Tieu Doan in
hex T-13.  Let's total up the costs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>REI is Regiment Legion Etranger Infantry, i.e., French Foreign Legion. MF 7.</li>
  <li>French Foreign Legion half-brigade MF 7</li>
  <li>GM is Group Mobile, i.e., mechanized. MF 14.</li>
</ul>

<p>The distance is 2 hexes.</p>

<p>I strongly suspect the mechanized units will pay a premium for movement
across river and woods hexes.</p>

<p>The terrain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First hex clear (1, 2) with river (+2, +3).</li>
  <li>Second hex forest (4, 7) with river (+2, +3).</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no double movement allowance as these units will end in an
EZOC.</p>

<p>Totaling everything up it requires 9 MF for the leg and 15 MF for the
mechanized to move 2 hexes. That's a no go, so they'll move to U-13 to
put some pressure on the Tieu Doan.</p>

<p>Next up, the Thai will defend Nghia Lo as it's a victory hex, containing
an airfield.  One Thai is in place, the other needs only move one hex,
from Q-11 to R-11. The terrain is rough, which requires 3 MF, and the
Thai have 9 MF to spend. Since there is no movement cost for moving into
(or out of) an EZOC, the Thai unit moves to reinforce Nghia Lo.
Hopefully they will be able to do some damage in return to the upcoming
attack from the Communists.</p>

<p>Now to move the stack of units from Ha Dong to somewhere useful. One
possibility is assaulting the NVA regiments lurking south of Hoa Binh,
but the best odds I could get there are 19:10, which is probably 1:1
because I don't see any other rounding rule specified. The FEF does get
a morale +1 if leading with DNA. However, it looks like they could
simply bypass the NVA as ZOCs apparently do not inhibit regular
movement, only double movement. This force is going to head to Na San to
shore up the defense there (Na San is a VP hex).</p>

<p>Huge stack of FEF leaves Hanoi towards Tuyen Quang. Can't get all the
way there, not enough MF and would end in EZOC preventing double MF
move.</p>

<p>Moved a GCMA onto the NA San hex, just in case.</p>

<p>That's it for movement phase. Only took a month to get this much of the
game figured out.</p>

<h3 id="attrition-phase-rule-50">Attrition Phase (rule 5.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>10</code>. All units with an OoS marker will lose 1 step each as
attrition unless able to draw supply (rule 5.0).</p>

<p>Nothing to do in attrition phase this turn, everything is assumed to be
in supply.</p>

<h3 id="operation-phase-rule-60">Operation Phase (rule 6.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>11</code>. Both players receive 10 operation points and both decide whether to spend an SD or not (rule 6.2).</p>

<p>Both will spend an SD.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>12</code>. VM rolls to get 1, 2 or 3 operation points (rule 6.1).</p>

<p>VM rolls 2 for 1 operation point to kick off Turn 1 Operations Phase.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Each point (rule 6.3) allows you to either:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove 3 DG / destroyed road markers (rule 4.5).</li>
  <li>Exchange an SD for 3 trench markers.</li>
  <li>Move a stack of units (see number 8 above).</li>
  <li>Destroy roads (rule 6.7).
If an SD was spent then you may also choose to</li>
  <li>Barrage with artillery (rule 6.6) (only if SD spent).</li>
  <li>Attack with troops (rules 6.4, 6.7 - 6.15) (only if SD spent).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">After the point/points are spent then it is FEF's turn.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>13</code>. FEF rolls to get 1, 2 or 3 operation points (rule 6.1).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Each point (rule 6.3) allows you to either:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove 3 DG / destroyed road markers (rule 4.5).</li>
  <li>Exchange an SD for 3 trench markers.</li>
  <li>Move a stack of units (see number 8 above).</li>
  <li>Barrage with airstrike/Navy (rule 6.6)</li>
  <li>Destroy roads (rule 6.7).</li>
  <li>(If an SD was spent) Barrage with artillery (rule 6.6)</li>
  <li>(If an SD was spent) Attack with troops (rules 6.4, 6.7 - 6.15).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">After the point/points are spent then it is VM's turn.
VM and FEF take turns to spend operation points
until both sides have spent ten points each.</p>

<h4 id="vm-1">VM 1</h4>

<p>138 and 42 attack FEF stack passing by on road. The odds are 10:19, so
1:1, with -1 terrain and -1 morale difference. The VM need to roll lucky
here, 2d6 roll 7 - 2 for 5 is <code>Ex-Al</code>. That's not too bad as the VM
units are each 3 step. The French have to take it out of the morale 4
unit which was defending, losing a single point of combat strength. Now
to roll for DG: VM 2 + 2 (forest)no DG, FEF 6 DG. Rolling a 6 is pretty much
guaranteed DG unless the unit is entrenched or has very high morale.</p>

<h4 id="fef-1">FEF 1</h4>

<p>FEF rolls 1, chooses to remove DG marker from previous battle.</p>

<p>That was fast.</p>

<h4 id="vm-2">VM 2</h4>

<p>Roll 2 for 1 operation, attack Thai in Nghia Lo at 23:4 odds which is
5:1. Roll 7 + 1 (morale) for 8 is <code>ExDL</code>, which eliminates the Thai.
VM DG roll 2, no effect. All VM advance after combat into Nghia Lo.</p>

<h4 id="fef-2-3-4">FEF 2, 3, 4</h4>

<p>Roll 6 for 3 operations.</p>

<p>First, move to Destroyed Road marker.</p>

<p>Second, remove Destroyed Road marker.</p>

<p>Third, continue moving that stack, which can only move another hex along
the road as it doesn't have enough MF to clear the adjacent river in the
forest. It is two moves from being able to attack Nghia Lo though.</p>

<h4 id="vm-3-4-5">VM 3, 4, 5</h4>

<p>VM roll 6 for 3 operations.</p>

<p>First, move to block the large stack of FEF.</p>

<p>Second, move artillery to blocking units.</p>

<p>Third, barrage the FEF in V-13 from V-12. From the Barrage table we need
to roll high to get good results. Defender morale 5 is -1, defender in
forest is -1, defender stacked 6+ is +1 for net -1, roll 11 (!) - 1 for
10 is <code>DG</code> the whole stack. Unmodified that would have been <code>DG &amp; DL</code>.</p>

<h4 id="fef-6-7-8">FEF 6, 7, 8</h4>

<p>FEF rolls 6 for 3 operations, lucky.</p>

<p>First, remove DG on mega-stack.</p>

<p>Second, move megastack to W-12, which is a single hex.</p>

<p>Third, attack the lone VM in W-11 at 22:6, which is 3:1 with defender in
forested hex. Roll 4 - 1 (defender in forested hex) + 2 (morale to FEF) = 5,
which is <code>Ex</code>, which isn't great, but the FEF can absorb it but than the VM.
VM roll 1 for no effect, FEF roll 5 for DG, bummer.</p>

<h4 id="vm-6">VM 6</h4>

<p>VM rolls 2 for 1 operation.</p>

<p>(I'm picking this up again after several months of not playing.)</p>

<p>Two regiments of the NVA 312 move towards Na San.</p>

<h4 id="fef-9">FEF 9</h4>

<p>FEF rolls 1 for 1 operation, remove DG from big stack south of Thai
Nguyen.</p>

<h4 id="vm-7">VM 7</h4>

<p>VM rolls for 1 operation. Will barrage from V12 to W12 with 4 points.
Target has a 5 morale unit for -1, but heavily stacked for +1, and
in mountain terrain, -1. VM need to roll 9 or above: 7, miss.</p>

<h4 id="fef-10">FEF 10</h4>

<p>No need to roll, this is the last FEF operation, and they will attack
W12 to V12. Odds are 21 to 13, because the barrage value may be used
in defense (S. 6.8, para. 2), hence 1:1 with -1 combat modifier for
defender in forest, +2 for morale difference, net +1 roll 9 + 1 for 10
which is <code>EX-DL</code>, not a bad result for the FEF given the odds.</p>

<p>DG roll for FEF is 2, +1 for defending artillery is 3, with DG being 5+,
FEF is not DG.</p>

<p>For VM, DG roll is 3 with 3+ resulting in DG.</p>

<h4 id="vm-8-9-10">VM 8, 9, 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>HQ and SD from U12 move to U11.</li>
  <li>DG removed</li>
  <li>Another barrage as above, maybe the VM will get lucky: roll 7,
missed.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that concludes the Operations Phase of Turn 1. On to supply…</p>

<h3 id="supply-check-phase-rule-70">Supply Check Phase (rule 7.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>14</code>. All units check for supply (rules 7.1 - 7.4). If a unit
is not in supply then it is marked with an OoS
marker (rule 7.5).</p>

<p>3 VM units out of supply, all FEF units in supply.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>15</code>. Reset the Phase marker, the VM truck transport
marker, the FEF air transport marker and move
the Month marker and start at number 1 again
(rule 1.10) or</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-1">End of Turn 1</h3>

<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/tonkin/g1-t1.jpg" alt="Tonkin Na San Turn 1" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-2-nov-1952">Turn 2, Nov. 1952</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Recap previous turn, and present challenges for both players for
this upcoming turn.</p>

<p>During the previous turn, neither the VM or FEF had any idea whatsoever
about what exactly to do, so they both blundered about. The VM did
manage to acquire Nghia Lo, which is a VP hex.</p>

<p>During the upcoming month of November, the FEF will attempt to recapture
Nghia Lo, while the VM will attempt to defend it while acquiring Na San
proper.</p>

<p>We'll see how it goes.</p>

<h3 id="replacement--reinforcement-phase-rule-20-1">Replacement &amp; Reinforcement Phase (rule 2.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>1</code>. VM receives reinforcement, if the VP level is equal to
or less than the current VM number (rule 2.1).</p>

<p>No reinforcements this scenario.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>2</code>. VM decides on mix of SD and Replacement Points
(rule 2.2). Regiments may receive replacements.</p>

<p>In this scenario, VM get an SD, which is placed on any road hex
connected to Thai Nguyen. In this case, it's going in hex S11.
VM also get 2 replacement points, each of which is used to rebuild a
step for 2 two regiments near Thai Nguyen.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>3</code>. VM non-motorized regiments may replace steps by
absorbing Tieu Doans within 2 hexes (rule 2.3).</p>

<p>There are no Tieu Doans within range at the start of Turn 2.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>4</code>. VM may mobilize an equal number of Tieu Doans
from Tieu Doan/Pathet Lao Box 2 as half the number
of VM-friendly VP hexes. Place them within 2 hexes
of a Vietnamese mobilization center (rule 9.0-2).
VM may place a Pathet Lao, from the same box, in a
VM-friendly mobilization center in Laos if there are
more VM-friendly centers in Laos than there are
Pathet Laos. Finally, move all units from box 1 to
box 2 (rule 2.4).</p>

<p>Nothing in Box 2.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>5</code>. FEF receives reinforcement and pays VP, or places
them on the Turn track (rule 2.5).</p>

<p>No reinforcements this scenario.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>6</code>. FEF decides on mix of SD and replacement points
(rule 2.6). Units may receive replacements.</p>

<p>1 SD in Hanoi, 4 replacement points received, spent 3.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>7</code>. FEF withdraws units (rule 2.7).</p>

<h3 id="vm-player-movement-phase-rule-30-1">VM Player Movement Phase (rule 3.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>8</code>. VM may move all VM units (rules 3.1, 3.8, 4.5, 6.14,
7.5). Units may double move (rule 3.2) and use
transports (rules 3.3, 3.4). Units may overrun
(rule 6.4).</p>

<p>VM move on Na San, while bolstering Nghia Lo and attempting to remain
well-fortified at Thai Nguyen. We'll see how it works out.</p>

<h3 id="fef-player-movement-phase-rule-30-1">FEF Player Movement Phase (rule 3.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>9</code>. All FEF units may move (rules 3.1, 3.8, 4.1, 4.3, 6.14,
7.5). Units may double move (rule 3.2)
use transports (rules 3.3 - 3.7). Units may overrun
(rule 6.4).</p>

<p>Move to assault at Thai Nguyen, reinforce at Na San.</p>

<h3 id="attrition-phase-rule-50-1">Attrition Phase (rule 5.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>10</code>. All units with an OoS marker will lose 1 step each as

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>11</code>. Both players receive 10 operation points and both decide
whether to spend an SD or not (rule 6.2).</p>

<p>FEF spending at Hanoi, VM spending from HQ north of Nghia Lo.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>12</code>. VM rolls to get 1, 2 or 3 operation points (rule 6.1).</p>

<h4 id="vm-1-2">VM 1, 2</h4>

<p>VM rolls 4 for 2 operations.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Each point (rule 6.3) allows you to either:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove 3 DG / destroyed road markers (rule 4.5).</li>
  <li>Exchange an SD for 3 trench markers.</li>
  <li>Move a stack of units (see number 8 above).</li>

After the point/points are spent then it is FEF's turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Barrage W12 from V12 and W11, 8 barrage points, with +1 modifier
for excessive stacking, -1 for mountaint and -1 for 5 morale,
roll 10 - 1 is 9, which is <code>DG &amp; DL</code>.</li>

<p class="turn-sequence">Each point (rule 6.3) allows you to either:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove 3 DG / destroyed road markers (rule 4.5).</li>
  <li>Exchange an SD for 3 trench markers.</li>
  <li>Move a stack of units (see number 8 above).</li>

After the point/points are spent then it is VM's turn.
VM and FEF take turns to spend operation points
until both sides have spent ten points each.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time to bring on an airstrike if possible:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Airstrike if possible on regiments of the 312 which are threatening
Na San from hex O14. Looks like it's possible, with -1 for forest, +1
for 6 or more stacking, net 0 modifiers, roll 10 which is <code>DG &amp; DL</code>,
a lucky break for the FEF.</li>
  <li>Combat on above unit at O14, odds 25:12, hence 2:1 with -1 for
defender in forest, roll 9 - 1 for 8 is <code>EX</code>. VM is already DG, FEF
rolls 6, which is pretty auto DG, especially since defender's hex is
forest, which applies +2 to the attacker's DG roll.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="vm-3">VM 3</h4>

<p>VM rolls 2 for 1 operation.</p>

<p>After several hours of deliberation, the VM decide to move the Spending
SD into Nghia Lo to allow an overrun to the south to proceed without
running out of supply.</p>

<h4 id="fef-3">FEF 3</h4>

<p>FEF rolls 1 for 1 Operation Point. This one is easy, the FEF chooses to
remove 2 of the DG markers. There does not seem to be a requirement for
proximity to a Spending Supply to remove DG.</p>

<h4 id="vm-4-5">VM 4, 5</h4>

<p>VM rolls 4 for 2 OP.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First operation is removing DG markers.</li>
  <li>Barrage W12, that stack is too dangerous to operate so closely to
Tuyen Quang. DRM net 0 roll 8 for <code>DG</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="fef-4-5-6">FEF 4, 5, 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Airstrike on V12 to attempt, no net DRM roll 8 for <code>DG</code>.</li>
  <li>Remove DG from stack in W12.</li>
  <li>Attack with all adjacant units on V12 odds 52:16 or 3:1 with DRM -1
for defender in forest +4 for morale shift net +3. Since the VM unit
is DG, it cannot ambush and cannot retreat. It wouldn't retreat
anyway given it's positioned right in front of Tuyen Quang, which is
a victory hex. Roll 5 (!) + 3 for 8 which <code>EX-DL</code>. FEF DG roll 3 - 1
(morale 4+) passes. Sadly, the VM loses an extra step by standing
fast as none of the attackers are DG</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="vm-6-7">VM 6, 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>VM remove DG markers.</li>
  <li>VM attack Na San at 1:1, no DRM roll 9 for <code>EX</code>. Both are DG by dint
of failing the DG roll.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="fef-7">FEF 7</h4>

<p>Single operation only, attack V12 at 54:9 which 6:1 with morale +4, this
rolls on the 5:1 table, roll 8 + 3 for 11 which is <code>2xDL</code>. VM choose to
retreat instead of taking second step loss out of artillery unit.</p>

<p>It's looking good for FEF here, they seem to have a chance to take Tuyen
Quang.</p>

<h4 id="vm-8-9-10-1">VM 8, 9, 10</h4>

<p>This is the last 3 operations for VM this turn, let's see if we can make
something of them. VM really need to DG the mega stack threatening Tuyen
Quang, but if the barrage fails to DG, that would be a disaster for the
defense. On the other hand, with three operations, there is pretty good
chance of making it succeed. Sadly, they don't have any supply spend to
conduct the barrage.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Move 102/308 to help defend.</li>
  <li>Remove DG, necessary.</li>
  <li>Move 88/308 to Phu Doan.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will make it very expensive for the FEF to take Tuyen Quang.</p>

<h4 id="fef-8-9-10">FEF 8, 9, 10</h4>

<p>FEF needs to focus on staying in supply. To that end, since the DNA is
wasting it's time up north, it needs to make a supply run to Hanoi.</p>

<ol>
  <li>DNA to Hanoi.</li>
  <li>DNA loads supply from Hanoi moves back north to the action.</li>
  <li>4:1 attack on VM in U12, roll 3 + 1 morale for 4 which is <code>Ex</code>.
VM failed DG roll, and loses an extra step standing fast.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's the end of that.</p>

<p>Spending Supply markers are now removed (6.2)</p>

<h3 id="supply-check-phase-rule-70-1">Supply Check Phase (rule 7.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>14</code>. All units check for supply (rules 7.1 - 7.4). If a unit
is not in supply then it is marked with an OoS
marker (rule 7.5).</p>

<h4 id="vm-supply">VM Supply</h4>

<p>All VM units are in or back in supply.</p>

<h4 id="fef-supply">FEF supply</h4>

<p>All FEF units are in supply.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>15</code>. Reset the Phase marker, the VM truck transport
marker, the FEF air transport marker and move
the Month marker and start at number 1 again
(rule 1.10) or</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-2">End of Turn 2</h3>

<p>This is getting easier to play. The biggest problem I'm having with it
is the Little Dudes. I vastly prefer NATO symbols, because all the
Little Dudes look the same to me, and it's difficult to tell which units
are which.</p>

<p>No picture because it's dark out and the light is very yellow in the
evening.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3-dec-1952">Turn 3, Dec. 1952</h2>

<p>Recap previous turn, and present challenges for both players for
this upcoming turn.</p>

<p>The FEF is putting some pretty serious pressure on Tuyen Quang, and the
VM may or may not be able to resist. It doesn't seem likely that the VM
will be able to take Na San, nor does it seem likely the FEF will retake
Nghia Lo. The most likely result appears to be a marginal victory for
one side or the other.</p>

<h3 id="replacement--reinforcement-phase-rule-20-2">Replacement &amp; Reinforcement Phase (rule 2.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>1</code>. VM receives reinforcement, if the VP level is equal to
or less than the current VM number (rule 2.1).</p>

<p>No reinforcements this game.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>2</code>. VM decides on mix of SD and Replacement Points
(rule 2.2). Regiments may receive replacements.</p>

<p>VM replacements: 1 at Tuyen Quang, the other for 88/308 in U12.
SD placed in hex U11.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>3</code>. VM non-motorized regiments may replace steps by
absorbing Tieu Doans within 2 hexes (rule 2.3).</p>

<p>1 TD absorbed at Na San.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>4</code>. VM may mobilize an equal number of Tieu Doans
from Tieu Doan/Pathet Lao Box 2 as half the number
of VM-friendly VP hexes. Place them within 2 hexes
of a Vietnamese mobilization center (rule 9.0-2).
VM may place a Pathet Lao, from the same box, in a
VM-friendly mobilization center in Laos if there are
more VM-friendly centers in Laos than there are
Pathet Laos. Finally, move all units from box 1 to
box 2 (rule 2.4).</p>

<p>No TD mobilization this game.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>5</code>. FEF receives reinforcement and pays VP, or places
them on the Turn track (rule 2.5).</p>

<p>No FEF reinforcements this game.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>6</code>. FEF decides on mix of SD and replacement points
(rule 2.6). Units may receive replacements.</p>

<p>4 replacements for FEF applied to stack at Tuyen Quang.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>7</code>. FEF withdraws units (rule 2.7).</p>

<p>Nothing to withdraw this game.</p>

<h3 id="vm-player-movement-phase-rule-30-2">VM Player Movement Phase (rule 3.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>8</code>. VM may move all VM units (rules 3.1, 3.8, 4.5, 6.14,
7.5). Units may double move (rule 3.2) and use
transports (rules 3.3, 3.4). Units may overrun
(rule 6.4).</p>

<p>The VM are falling back from Na San in favor of protecting a marginal
win by reinforcing Nghia Lo. Other units are bolstered.</p>

<h3 id="fef-player-movement-phase-rule-30-2">FEF Player Movement Phase (rule 3.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>9</code>. All FEF units may move (rules 3.1, 3.8, 4.1, 4.3, 6.14,
7.5). Units may double move (rule 3.2)
use transports (rules 3.3 - 3.7). Units may overrun
(rule 6.4).</p>

<p>FEF is going for the complete victory by attempting to take both Tuyen
Quang and Nghia Lo. Will be interesting to see if this can be done. It's
hard for the FEF to move into position since double moves are negated by
the number of units in contact with each other.</p>

<h3 id="attrition-phase-rule-50-2">Attrition Phase (rule 5.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>10</code>. All units with an OoS marker will lose 1 step each as
attrition unless able to draw supply (rule 5.0).</p>

<p>All units in supply, no attrition this turn.</p>

</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Each point (rule 6.3) allows you to either:</p>

until both sides have spent ten points each.</li>

<p>Roll 2 for 1 OP.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Move Tieu Doan to Nghia for defending.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="fef-3-4">FEF 3, 4</h4>

<p>Roll 4 for 2 OP.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Move GM 1 and GM 4 to north of Tuyen Quang, overrunning the bare SD.

necessary in this case as there is no way for the FEF to win it.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Marginal victory for VM, which held Tuyen Quang and Nghia Lo at game's
end.</p>

<p>Two things the French could have done better:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Worked harder to hold Nghia Lo, because if it falls it will be very
difficult to recapture.</li>
  <li>Attempt to grab the VM HQ, which was pretty vulnerable at the end of
Turn 2. This might have forced the VM to remove units from the
victory hexes to prevent suddent death.</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all, a pretty good game. It took me a really long time to
complete it (finishing on March 27, 2016) due to overworking at work and
the novelty of the rule system. The system is somewhat different than
other games, especially the movement costs.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Spending Supply marker must be within 3 hexes of the units using that
supply for attack or barrage in Operations Phases F &amp; G.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No overruns were conducted during this game (other than an SD), which
feels like a mistake, as there aren't enough operation points to
achieve victory.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ZOCs seem to have very little effect in this game, at least much less
effect then in many other games where entering a ZOC halts movement,
and ZOCs induce movement costs either entering or leaving, and disrupt
supply lines. In Tonkin, ZOCs do none of these things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SD (supply dump) markers seem to be used at the rate of 1 per turn,
simply allowing the Operations Phase to proceed for each side spending
an SD.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Air Strikes, it's not clear how many of these may be used.
Apparently, the FEF could use full air strike for every operation
point on every turn.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Evidently, Na San scenario (#6) has FEF trenches, which I did not see
in the OOB for setup. This probably would have made a difference at
Nghia Lo, but no bug deal. I emplaced them at the start of Turn 2.
As it turned out, trenches are removed when either 1. the unit leaves
the hex, or 2. an enemy unit occupies the hex.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attacking when supply is more than 3 hexes away. Spending at Saigon
doesn't support combat at Na San.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Turn 3, the VM spent supply at Nghia Lo, which was a mistake
costing the ability to use the artillery at Tuyen Quang to barrage
attacking FEF.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Step Loss markers reduce the combat/barrage, morale and stacking value
by 1.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
