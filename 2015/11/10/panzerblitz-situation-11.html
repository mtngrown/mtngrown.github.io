PanzerBlitz Situation 11 (& Hive 1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 10 2015</time>
<p>It has been almost a year since I've had any PanzerBlitz on the table,
so I thought I'd get Situation #11 set up for some leisurely play over
the next couple of weeks. I've also got Tonkin set up in the back room,
but that's going very slowly as I'm teaching myself the rules.</p>

<p>The situation looks pretty interesting, another attempt to clear a 3 hex
lane through Russian defenses, only this time with a lot of German
armor. We'll see how it goes.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>The German plan is to make a full-frontal massive attack directly at the
Russian line. No idea how well this will work, but the Germans only have
8 turns to clear a lane, so they can't be dancing around.</p>

<p>Here's the positions after the German's first move.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s11-g1-t1-g.jpg" alt="End of Germans first turn move" /></p>

<p>Hard to say what the Russians will do. They will have to be careful not
to lose to many units.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>The Germans continue to rush into trouble, resulting in first blood to
the Russians. Predictably, a Guards unit CATs a dispersed Panther for a
kill. This Panther was dispersed on a previous 2:1 shot from the 76.2mm
on the adjecant hilltop.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s11-g1-t2.jpg" alt="End of Turn 2" /></p>

<p>The Russian armor decides to fall back in attempt to get at least two
shots off at the German armor. Without falling back, they would get only
one shot each.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s11-g1-t3.jpg" alt="End of Turn 3" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s11-g1-t4.jpg" alt="End of Turn 4" /></p>

<p>And the game is half over. The Germans are in pretty good position, but
they can't waste any time, even if it costs a lot of Panthers to finish
clearing a lane.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>Germans push hard in the south. Russians attempt to fall back to set up
a covering position further to the east.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s11-g1-t5.jpg" alt="End of Turn 5" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>Germans continue to box in the Russians such that they can be pushed to
the north.</p>

<p>Russians don't have any direct fire opportunity this turn, go straight
to movement.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s11-g1-t6.jpg" alt="End of Turn 6" /></p>

<p>Note that the German self-propelled artillery is on the west side of the
playing area, not shown in the photo.</p>

<p>The game looks unwinnable for the Russians at this point. I actually
went through shot calling phase for German Turn 7, and it pretty much
would have wiped out the remaining Russians. No need to belabor the
point.</p>

<h3 id="aar">AAR</h3>

<p>This one of the few situations which feel lopsided in the German's favor
rather than the Russian's favor. I think the Russians could do a lot
better. The T-34s should be getting a good shot off at least every other
turn. In this game, they didn't fire at all.</p>

<p>Game finished and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/16518735">logged on November
14</a>.</p>

<h2 id="blunders">Blunders</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Russian heavy mortar should have been on a central hilltop
instead of off to the south side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Russian tanks could have been "held in reserve" to go threaten the
German Hummel and Wespes which were set up on west side. This would
have been a terrible distraction for the Germans. As it stood on Turn
6, the Russian tanks never got off a shot.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="also-hive">Also: Hive</h2>

<p>I also played a solo game of Hive to work out how the pieces move.
Putting that here for posterity.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
