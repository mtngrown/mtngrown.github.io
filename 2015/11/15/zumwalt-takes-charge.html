<p>Zumwalt - 2015-11-15</p>

<p>Played the whole hog with AS at EGO. Went about 6 hours including setup.
He could have won, but he passed with 27 CPs left, then I built a huge
stack of NVA and ran amuck, killing FWA units and gathering VPs.</p>

<p>I was able to a much better job this game, from my initial setup, to
accumulating victory conditions.</p>

<p>We did make a huge blunder: we misread the random events roll such that
the 3 5's rolled in a row were taken as "Media Circus" rather than
weather. Media Circus doubles all victory points. Unfortunately, during
these turns, my NVA didn't have any boats, and had to pass on most
operations. Hence, the FWA got a lot of points from taking bases.</p>

<p>However, the FWA managed to get themselves into another massive supply
bind, and lost a stupendous number of units into the Refit box.</p>

<p>Speaking of the refit box, that's the place to draw from in the long
game. It's cheap to get units from refit, half or third the cost of
reinforcements.</p>

<h2 id="some-questions">Some questions.</h2>

<p>At some point, I will collect all of these together and post them.</p>

<p>How much does it cost to employ Recon aircraft? We're playing it comes
for free in support of an operation.</p>

<p>Where do Deception units go when flipped? Out of play or Refit?</p>

<p>When Troop and Supply infiltration junks are flipped during VP phase,
are these removed form play or got into Refit box? We played they go
into refit.</p>

<p>Where do guerrilla units go after flipping?</p>

<p>What happens to FWA supply boats when used during logistics phase?</p>

<p>Guerrilla markers can be used for end-of-turn VP?</p>

<p>How is trawler supply used?</p>

<p>Can break off go into diagonal?</p>

<p>How are Deception units placed as reinforcements?</p>

<p>NVA 258, FWA 231, marginal NVA victory.</p>

<hr />

<p>Game Warden Scenario</p>

<p>On setup, note that supply infiltration and troop infiltration junks are
placed in cambodia.</p>

<p>Cadre occupation acquire double VP during territorial victory point
phase.</p>

<p>VC militia and local force infantry are always in supply, so do not
deploy these bases.</p>

<p>Deploy supply caches in towns without militia or local forces.</p>

<p>Do not deploy bunkers with deception units only.</p>

<p>Guerrilla markers go out of play when revealed?</p>

<p>Deception goes out of play or in reinforcements or refit once revealed?</p>

<p>For airstrike only, does Z send air unit to refit?</p>

<p>What are FWA CI units good for?</p>

<p>Roll for bounce on every combat cycle?</p>

<p>Final score nva 63, fwa 44, draw</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
