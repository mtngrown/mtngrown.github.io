They Retreated to Victory, barely
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 28 2015</time>
<p>Played a long and intense game of France '40 with CC. I was Allies, and
barely squeaked out a win, after narrowly escaping two or three traps. I
think he actually missed a couple of opportunities to exploit those
situations he had me in.</p>

<p>Part of the reason the Allies got into a bind is they started the game
<em>very</em> aggressively, in an attempt to put the Germans on a back foot.
That didn't work out so well.</p>

<p>I took pictures of a couple of the blunders I made during the game. The
idea is that the next time I play this, I'll review these pictures and
notes, and not make them again. That's probably wishful thinking!</p>

<p>The pictures are from Turn 2 and the end of the game.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2-situation-at-calais">Turn 2 situation at Calais</h2>

<p>35 french light tank should be 1 hex closer to calais to get minor river
defender double.</p>

<p>In this case, it's fortunate the Halt! marker prevents the Germans from
attacking, and 1 Pz is tied up at Calais until it falls.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/dynamo-g2-t2-calais.jpg" alt="Turn 2 - 44 Mech" /></p>

<p>Due to not doing a determined defense, the defender at calais went to
0-0-3, hence no determined defense, 1 Pz crossed the minor river
massively threatening dunkirk. (!!!)</p>

<p>would be good to add a unit to calais to keep the odds high</p>

<h1 id="use-those-minor-rivers">Use those minor rivers</h1>

<p>Examining the map of the coastline between Boulogne-sur-Mer and Ostende,
it's easy to see why Dunkirk was chosen for the evacuation: it's ringed
by canal and small rivers extending many kilometers to the south and
east. None of the other ports or towns have this natural defensive
structure.</p>

<p>The Allies should attempt to exploit this defensive structure as much as
possible, and not end up where 44 Mech ended after punching that 3rd panzer
division in the nose (disrupted stack).</p>

<p>The key is "advance after combat" can be in any direction instead of
only "forward through the vacated hex." 44 Mech would have been better
put to advance to hex 2220 just to the southeast of its shown position
(south is up in this photo).</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/dynamo-g2-turn-2-1.jpg" alt="Turn 2 - 44 Mech" /></p>

<p>Moving 44 Mech into 2220 would prevent German units from crossing Canal
de Neufosse into 2220 to attack either 44 Mech or 1 NA and denying
either the x2 defensive advantage of defending behind minor river or
canal (Vert would move to 2020 to attach 44 Mech). The Germans would be
forced to attack only with 7 Pz, risking a dangerous step loss as armor
shift is lost across river as well. In fact, as the situation stands
right now, 7 Pz crossing into 2220 would get the armor shift on 1 NA,
Vert could move to 2320 and stack with, say, 76/20M leaving the bottom
20M unit in reserve.</p>

<h2 id="protecting-dunkirk">Protecting Dunkirk</h2>

<p>The primary Allied mistake here is not establishing a defensive perimeter
further out. ZOC bonds could have helped establish that perimeter, but it's
going to be hard for the Allies to push the Germans back.</p>

<p>(DISCUSS POOR ALLIED POSITIONING)</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/dynamo-g2-early-dunkirk.jpg" alt="Turn 2 - 44 Mech" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-9-and-end-of-game">Turn 9 and end of game</h2>

<p>The game came down to a final die roll at Dunkirk. The Allies were
defending with 15 to attacking 31 for 2:1, 3:1 with +1R air, the die
rolled a <code>DR</code>, and the defenders rolled a 6 on Determined Defense. This
left all 3 defenders in Dunkirk, with only 1 defender needing to
evacuate for the Sudden Death win.</p>

<p>The situation looked like this:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/france40/dynamo-g2-end.jpg" alt="End of Turn 9 and game" /></p>

<p>Dunkirk is defended by two Remnants and the full strength 2 Mech.</p>

<p>Note: the position of Germans stacked with 83 ID were inadvertantly
swapped with the French 9 Bn armor unit in the eastern beach hex. That
beach hex was occupied by Monty and evicted by the German infantry. The
swap occurred when I started to put the game away then decided I wanted
to write up the end of game situation.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Very tense game, CC played pretty well.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<p>Many.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lost too many French units allowing the German infantry to get too
close too soon. Even holding them one more turn would have made a
comfortable Allied win.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Germans had at least 2, possibly 3 opportunities to massively
followup on Allied mistakes, but did not exploit these mistakes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Germans never used reserves. Had they done so, they would have
been able to penetrate sooner and faster into Allied hinterland.
For example, in the 44 Mech (Allied) example above, 7 Pz could have
attacked 1 NA with 20 Mech and Vert in reserve. Since Rommel gets a
re-roll if desired, it's almost certain the Germans could have broken
the line here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allies using a "speed bump" French armor Bn to attempt to hem in
Rommel and 7 Pz. This allowed an Auto-DS situation, which occurs
during movement, and allows the attacker Breakthrough extra advance.
This breakthrough almost closed off a huge number of Allied units
south of a Bethune-Armentiers line. This is one of the places where
the Germans missed an opportunity to really hurt the Allies. What they
could have done was close the pocket then let the Allies expire from
being out of supply.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
