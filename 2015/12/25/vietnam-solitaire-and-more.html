Vietnam Solitaire (8) and more
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 25 2015</time>

<p>It's Christmas Day and super chilly outside, no better time than now to
fire up some games. My initial inclination was to lay out Fire in the
Lake, but I wanted to play a few smaller games before locking up table
space, and by the time I knocked out the following there really wasn't
time enough to set up Fire in the Lake.</p>

<p>In any case, it was nice to play through some of my smaller, faster
playing games.</p>

<h2 id="vietnam-solitaire-easter-offensive">Vietnam Solitaire Easter Offensive</h2>

<p>I have 7 logged play of Vietnam Solitaire, and none of them are the new
Easter Offensive sceario shipping with the Special Edition. Time to
rectify that.</p>

<p>Having set it up, I've found an inconsistency in the set up rules, which
hasn't been resolved on line yet. At issue is initial forces in Mekong,
which is a region not played in this scenario. In any case, plowing
ahead rather than dithering.</p>

<h3 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Purchase 4 ARVN with available PP, place all 4 in Saigon as that's a
victory condition region.</li>
  <li>Major offensive, NVA/VC operations in Hue, Highlands and Saigon:
    <ul>
      <li>Hue: lose 1 NV, 1 ARVN.</li>
      <li>Highlands: Lose 1 ARVN.</li>
      <li>Saigon: Areas 3-4 iVC eliminated, and 6, ARVN making reaction move into 6
another VC eliminated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>B52 strike fails, raised AC and ARVN, suffering from lack of PP.</li>
  <li>Minor NVA offensive in Region 2 superfluous, no US/ARVN present.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h3>

<p>8 PP available, need to knock down some trail if possible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>3rd trail counter for Highlands, hence not placed.</li>
  <li>B52 on Hanoi fails due to SAM roll.</li>
  <li>Insurgency combat in Saigon: NVA eliminated from Area 6.</li>
  <li>Minor offensive in Saigon: Region 6, NVA elininated.</li>
  <li>NVA relocation puts 3 NVA in Area 1-2 Saigon.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h3>

<p>8 PP available</p>

<ul>
  <li>3rd Trail counter in Haiphong, not placed.</li>
  <li>B52 Haiphong, evaded SAM, missed.</li>
  <li>Raise US/AVRN: 7th Fleet on the board, 2 more ARVN in Hue.</li>
  <li>ARVN attacking in Hue Region 3-4 Hue City, VC and NVA  and 1 ARVN
elminated on Round 1, Round 2 NVA armor and 1 ARVN eliminated.</li>
  <li>Insurgency in Hue: 2 ARVN 1 NVA, only 1 ARVN left, bad news. In
Saigon, NVA eliminated.</li>
  <li>Minor offensive in Saigon, round 1 ARVN elminated, round 2 bupkis,
round 3 NVA last standing.</li>
  <li>NVA relocation: move 1 to Saigon.</li>
  <li>AC redeploy to Saigon Area 1-2.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h3>

<p>12 PP now, will need every one!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trail roll 3, no placement.</li>
  <li>Attack Hanoi trail: fail.</li>
  <li>Loads of ARVN, including Mech.</li>
  <li>Saigon cleared.</li>
  <li>NVA infiltrate Saigon Area 6.</li>
  <li>Minor offensive in Saigon with 5 NVA facing 5 ARVN. Round 1 3 each
lost. Round 2 1 ARVN lost. Round 3, 1 ARVN 1 NVA lost, with 1 NVA left
standing. NVA have been rolling really well this game.</li>
  <li>Insurgency succeeds in Saigon Area 6.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h3>

<p>12 PP this turn.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trial roll 3, no effect.</li>
  <li>Attack trail at Saigon, roll 6 no effect. There has not been any
effective trail roll this game.</li>
  <li>Raised all ARVN into Hue and Saigon.</li>
  <li>Cleared both Hue and Saigon. Now will have to depend on reaction move
to try to get the odds on the major offensive coming next.</li>
  <li>Insurgency Saigon 3-4, totally fails, Saigon stands.</li>
  <li>Major offensive, only units in Hue matter. US and ARVN are positioned
in Areas 3-4 and 6, with NVA in Areas 1-2 and 5. So there is a chance
for the US/ARVN to pull off a minor victory. Area 3-4, round 1: NVA
cleared. Area 6: 1 NVA 1 RFPF lost. Round 2: NVA rolled another 1,
pretty much NVA has rolled 1 &amp; 2 on most combats this game, along with
US and ARVN rolling 5 &amp; 6. Pretty amazing. Round 3: NVA lost, Hue is
controlled. Game over for US/ARVN win.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="aar">AAR</h3>

<p>US/ARVN marginal victory with control of Hue and Saigon.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I mucked up some of the rules, and there is the issue of
all the NVA combat units in Mekong which did not participate. In the
Highlands, I didn't fool with clearing it, and just let the NVA build up
in there and spill over into Saigon, where I had the ARVN firepower to
clean them up.</p>

<p>I'm definitely going to play this scenario again, hopefully after
getting resolution on the Mekong situation, and figuring out whether I
botched up the situation in the Highlands.</p>

<h2 id="flash-point">Flash Point</h2>

<p>Quick round of the Family Game setup in Flash Point, took about 35
minutes. I probably got some of the turns out of order, but it did come
down to one last roll where I would have gotten a 4th victim clear had
not the building collapsed. I played with 3 firefighters.</p>

<p>This game saw all 33 of the fire markers on the board. I didn't know
what to do, so I just added damage marker where they would otherwise go.
It turns out this is in the FAQ on page 11 of the rules, so I played it
correctly, rules-as-written.</p>

<p>It also didn't help that 3 of 6 victims "rescued" were dummy markers.
Luck of the draw.</p>

<p>This play bumps my H-Index to 8.</p>

<h2 id="some-rounds-of-hive">Some rounds of Hive</h2>

<p>I've been playing Hive on the Beginner setting, and can now reliably
beat the AI. It's time to bump the difficulty level up a notch and beat
the intermediate level. Recorded plays are plays for which I've set the
pieces up on the table and worked through my moves "analog style." I use
the application to play the opponent, and move those pieces manually on
the table. I've got other plays which are ios only, typically played on
the train, but I don't count those.</p>

<p>In the following, I'm playing White, and letting the AI move the Black.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Beginner: White win.</li>
  <li>Easy: White win. This unlocks Medium play.</li>
  <li>Medium: first play, white defeat, Beetle stacking is important.</li>
  <li>Medium: Beetle stacking continues to be important! Also, black drew
white out into a spindly mess and tied up 7 tiles with only 3 tiles
of its own. This allowed Black to leisurely gobble up White's Queen.</li>
</ol>

<p>Playing an AI on a table top is harder than it might first appear, as
it's easy to get absorbed in the electronic game and forget to keep up
in the analog game.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
