Pandemic, Hive and more non-wargames
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 26 2015</time>
<p>At the moment, I don't have the time or set up space to deal with my
usual wargame fare, so I'm playing through a number of lighter games. It
feels like cheating to get my games played count and H-Index up, and
perhaps in a way it is. I may separate out wargame stats from total
stats in the future. In the meantime, I rather enjoy Hive and Pandemic,
so I'm not sure why I give a damn.</p>

<h2 id="hive">Hive</h2>

<p>Another round with the AI on medium setting, and I lost by one move.
The AI is working that beetle hard on the medium setting, and I'm
starting to do the same. While it sucks to lose to a machine, it still
feels pretty good to see the endgame several moves ahead. In this game,
I was pretty sure I had lost it about 3 moves before Black's final move.
Even better, I know Black was going to sink the beetle, and that's
exactly what it did.</p>

<p>Game 2: At YTO f2f against BB, just barely won.</p>

<p>Game 3: At YTO f2f against JT, he handed me my ass despite never playing
it before. It was embarrassing. He did mention later that his
grandfather pounded him at chess for years, which may be why he's so
good at looking many moves ahead.</p>

<h2 id="flash-point">Flash Point</h2>

<p>6 player basic game at YTO, pretty fun, we won it. I'd like to get this
group into the standard game, even into the expansions maybe in the
future. We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>One benefit is that it played out pretty fast.</p>

<p>I still have problems with rules.</p>

<h2 id="pandemic">Pandemic</h2>

<p>Solo play with 2 hands, the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine
Specialist.</p>

<p>I think I won it, although the first couple of turns I forget to draw
cards and infect. I did well enough to have 11 Event ards left in the
stack, and played 3 of 4 Epidemic cards. I may have missed advancing
Outbreak and Infection Rate by 1 or 2, but these had plenty left in the
track so there was no danger of losing from those.</p>

<p>From what I've read, Pandemic is regarded as somewhat simplistic, and
certainly isn't to everyone's taste, but I think I like it well enough,
and it seems easy enough to play with general audiences.</p>

<p>I do have a hard time playing this solo as I forgot who's "turn" it is.
I get absorbed in the game play and lose track. This should be easier
playing it with others.</p>

<h2 id="hapsburg-eclipse">Hapsburg Eclipse</h2>

<p>In a departure from my normal practice, I'm not logging the entire play
for this game of Hapsburg Eclipse. Instead, I'm playing each card very
carefully, and checking through the rules.</p>

<p>This has already been productive, as I just learned from the first card
that I've been playing Loyalties wrong: I've been moving the Loyalty
track automatically instead of making a loyalty check roll. The token
only moves towards revolt if the check fails. I can still attempt to
move it back right during the Action phase if the check fails. This
really helps the game play.</p>

<p>Got part of the way through the Yellow deck, but finally lost on
National Will. The Polish and Carpathian Fronts occupied the flag
spaces, which really adds up the points. Good game, I learned more of
the rules.</p>

<h2 id="betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill">Betrayal at House on the Hill</h2>

<p>JT brought this over as a present for BB, so we played a 6 player game
of it. Our situation resolved into ThFiddler (Number 9), and I got to be
the first Bad Guy. By the end of the game, we had one dead, several bad
guys, but QA pulled it out with some super lucky rolls. Otherwise, Team
Fiddler would hav won it for sure, namely, my character.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
