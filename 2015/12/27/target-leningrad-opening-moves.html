<p>Today's focus is on the opening moves for Target Leningrad.
Specifically, figuring out a best initial setup for the Germans.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g3-setup.jpg" alt="Initial set up" /></p>

<p>Five initial battles result. From northwest to southeast:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>38th Infantry Corps against 10th Mech Corps at 6:1. This is an
auto-elimination for 1 step unit. 38 advances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>41st Panzer Corps against 1st Infantry Corps (Russian) at
6:1. Auto-elimination. 41st advances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>10th and 23rd Inf. Corps against 24th Inf. Corps at 4:1. Roll 4 for
<code>DRL</code>, eliminated. 10th Corps advances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1st Infantry Corps (German) and 56 Pz Corps against 11th Army at 2:1,
with 1R for Air Support yields 3:1, roll 2 for <code>DR</code>. 56 Pz advances. The
slightly over-the-odds 18:8 ensured that any <code>EX</code> result would be soaked
up by the German infantry instead of the Pz division.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2d Inf. Corps against 52 Army at 1:1. This is a dicey business here,
but it can't be helped. The Germans have to be bold. With a little
luck on the dice, they'll push them back. Roll 2 for <code>EX</code>, a good
result for the Germans.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g3-t1-german-combat-results.jpg" alt="Turn 1 German combat
results" /></p>

<p>The key here is to elmininate the Russian 1st Mech and 24 Inf. Corps to
be able to advance into the vacated spaces. Then a 2:1 + Air can be
mounted against 11 Army. The will be a guaranteed step loss on the 3:1
column on the CRT, as the 11 Army <em>must</em> retreat through EZOCs
established by 0209 and 0410. (<strong>10.7 Advance after Combat, the play
example specifically illustrates this technique.</strong>)</p>

<p>Here's the result of German special movement phase:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g3-t1-g-special-movement.jpg" alt="Turn 1 German special movement
results" /></p>

<p>Now the Russians take their turn, which is mainly try and get as far
east as possible as fast as possible.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Germans drive deep:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g3-t2.jpg" alt="Turn 2" /></p>

<p>Not really sure what the best strategies are for either side.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Germans now in position to threaten Leningrad. This will be interesting,
I haven't been in this position this early in this game yet.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/target-leningrad/g3-t3.jpg" alt="Turn 3" /></p>

<p>The Russians move to prevent Germans from flanking.</p>

<p>This is the last screenshot from this game. I have what I wanted out of
it initially, which is details on the German's opening move, and it's
getting late on a Sunday afternoon before going back to work after a
holiday weekend, with large release looming in mid-January. Keeping it
set up to do detailed analysis turn by turn could easily result in just
bailing from the game. I'd rather play it out fast and put it up
instead.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4---germans-take-leningrad">Turn 4 - Germans take Leningrad</h2>

<p>The Germans took Leningrad with a roll of 6 on the 3:1 table, which is a
<code>DRL</code>. The <code>R</code> is canceled due to the Fleet presence, but there was only
a single step unit in Leningrad, so it was lost. This is a lesson to the
Russian player: have more than one unit in Leningrad. Losing Leningrad
means the powerful Leningrad Workers' Militia unit cannot come into
play.</p>

<p>Since this was the first time I've been able to take Leningrad, I think
it's worthy of writing up a few more notes. Now to see if they can keep
it.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The rest of the game played out nicely, with the Germans holding
Leningrad, the rail junctions, but losing Novgorod resulting in a draw.
I probably should have moved one of the armor corps out of Leningrad by
Turn 6 to have it available for, e.g., retaking Novgorod.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I played this game such the friendly units did not negate
EZOCs. I think that's correct. It wouldn't have changed the outcome much
if I got this wrong, at least in this game.</p>

<p>I think my next play of Target Leningrad will be a study on all the
possible ways to set up the game. The restriction on Soviet armies to be
separated renders this quite tractable with (off the top of my head)
only 4 or 5 different combinations of setups that the Soviets can use.
It should be possible to configure the German attacks to do as much
damage as what they did in this game.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
