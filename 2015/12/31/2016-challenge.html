2016 Mastery Challenge
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 31 2015</time>
<p>This article was started on December 31, 2015 as an experiment to see
how good I was at goal setting with respect to games. Overall, it turned
out fair. I didn't achieve all (any) of the goals I set out to achieve,
but I had a lot of fun, played a lot of games, and got a much better
notion of what's achievable given my work commitment.</p>

<p>Reading through the various lists below, you will see that my main
interest is in wargames, specifically historical conflict simulations.
These games tend to be much heavier than most other games. For example,
as I write this preface (December 26, 2016), I've just spent the
afternoon setting up the order of battle for a simulation of the failed
Soviet offensive on Kharkov in May 1942. The game is Case Blue.  Setting
up the scenario only took a few hours, as I already spent a week of
evenings collecting the appropriate units (counters). In other the
words, just the set up consumes as much time as playing several, more
normal games.</p>

<p>This time commitment is reflected in <a href="/2016/12/31/2017-mastery-challenge.html">2017's Mastery Challenge
goals</a>, which are a bit
more reasonable than 2016's goals.</p>

<h2 id="recapping-2016">Recapping 2016</h2>

<p>The 5x5 was a disaster, and I won't be doing that again in 2017. What I
will be doing is finding 5 games with at least some plays to get to the
"Nickel" (5 play status). This is much more reasonable, and sets these
games up for a future drive to "Dime" (10 play) status. Games with Dime
status are H-index candidates.</p>

<p>Increasing Average Plays was my main focus in 2016, followed by
increasing the H-index. Hence the 5x5 and Vietnam game missed goals.
In the future, I'm going to work on maintaining Average Plays at 5,
which is convenient for establishing Nickel status.</p>

<p>Vietnam games: I didn't do very well at all in knocking down my list of
unplayed Vietnam games. I could do this much faster at the expense of
H-index and Average Plays. Not sure what my goal for 2017 will be,
possibly 5 new games, one of which ought to be one of the historical
oddballs. We'll see.</p>

<p>For 2017, would like to promote a few games to Dime status: Silver
Bayonet, Hapsburg Eclipse, France '40, Pandemic, and possibly Ukraine
'43. The main focus of 2017, however, will be H-index to 12. (2018 I'm
thinking will be a focus on playing as many new games as possible, which
will drive down the average plays substantially, but will provide a
large base from which to draw future Nickels and Dimes for provisioning
the H-index. 2019 I think will be the year for a campaign game. 2020,
play through all the COIN games. 2021, classics.)</p>

<h2 id="random-observations">Random observations</h2>

<p>December 26, 2016: Turned out to be not a bad year after all, despite
being very dry the first three month of 2016. I may do that again, spend
the first three months of 2017 knocking out yearly chores (taxes, health
care, etc.), and dig deep into work-related activities.</p>

<p>December 13, 2016: A lot has transpired since my last note in March. I
have a new job as of December 2, 2016, and I was able to get at least
some plays in after all. I'm 9 plays away from H-index 12, and it looks
pretty unlikely I'll make the number by the end of 2016. But that's
nothing to worry about, it means I'll hit it in 2017 no problem. I'll
propose a tentative goal of H-index 13 in 2017, but I'm not worried
about hitting it exactly.</p>

<p>March 27, 2016: Finished Tonkin, which had been set up since end of
October, 2015. This was a bit of a blocker for me, I really wanted to
finish this game before starting something else, and to do that, I had
to finish learning the game as well. Playing the game all the way
through the first time is the hardest. I'm hoping to start playing more
often now that Tonkin is finished. The next games will be from the 5x5
or H-Index lists. No more new games for a while.</p>

<p>March 19, 2016: I haven't played a single game of anything
at all this year. Work, career advancement supplementary to work,
infrastructural concerns (e.g., taxes, etc.) and health maintenance
issues have precluded time to play. So much for intentions.</p>

<p>Given the Death March we're kicking off on at work, I'd say there is
little chance of me accomplishing anything remotely close to these
objectives, but we'll see how it works out.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge-lists">The challenge lists</h2>

<p>Each of these lists represents a goal I believed I could achieve in
2016, from my state of mind at the end of 2015.</p>

<h2 id="x-5">5 x 5</h2>

<p>First up is 5 x 5, that is, play 5 different games 5 times each.
Here's what I chose at the end of 2015:</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="new-vietnam-games">10 new Vietnam games</h2>

<p>I hope to play 10 out of the following, preliminary list of candidate games:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tonkin: <a href="/2015/10/25/kim-kanger-s-tonkin.html">Na San</a>.</li>
  <li>Forgotten Heroes Vietnam:
<a href="/2016/07/02/first-try-at-forgotten-heroes-vietnam.html">The Village</a>,

  <li>Silver Bayonet:

<a href="/2016/11/25/silver-bayonet-tea-time-scenario-6a.html">Scenario #6A: Tea Time</a>,
<a href="/2016/11/26/silver-bayonet-tea-times-2.html">Scenario #6B: Tea Time+</a>,

  <li>Green Beret (Train)</li>
  <li>Green Beret (Harvey)</li>
  <li>Downtown</li>
  <li>Tet (Chadwick)</li>
  <li>Victory in Vietnam (Schutze)</li>
  <li>Operation Pegasus</li>
  <li>Meatgrinder</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternates would include one or more of the HFD games. They aren't my
favorite, but some of them provide the only game coverage for certain
battles. Other substitutions may occur according to opportunity to play
with my regular Vietnam opponent.</p>

<h2 id="h-index-12">H-Index 12</h2>

<p>Given how 2016 started with me working on New Year's Day, and the
following day, and the following day, which were on weekends, I'm not
that optimistic about meeting all the goals discussed here. If there is
one goal I think I would like to meet, it's upping my H-Index to 12.</p>

<p>This should not be hard to accomplish and still have fun. Trying for 13
would risk not having fun.</p>

<p>This is the overall H-Index, which started 2016 at, 8 but just a few games
from 9. 10 should not be a problem, 11 will take some work, so 12 is
definitely a challenge.</p>

<p>Limiting to wargames only, my H-Index started 2016 at 7. I should be able to get
this to 9 without too much trouble. Wargames just take so much longer to
play than most games, so I'm not going to sweat it overmuch.</p>

<p>Here's a list of the top candidates for getting to H-Index 12:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>40/9</code> Hive: I've crushed the AI in the IoS version of this game.
Supposedly, the game is more complex than chess. I don't think it's
as hard as Go though. Would be really nice to find a good AI for it.
I might have to install the online Java client to find online
opponents.</p>

    <p>I'm now playing this v2f2 on Board Game Arena, and getting thoroughly
skunked by beginner players. What's interesting is that I seem to get
on the defensive with 2 - 3 moves of opening, then play defense from
a linear series of attacks. My usual f2f partner is more subtle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>34/33</code> Ogre: I'll probably play a fair bit of Ogre/GEV this year as we
have a dedicated local group of enthusiasts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> PanzerBlitz: I'm just 6 games short of playing all scenarios
  solo, twice. I still need to solo 10 and 12, but I have played them
  ftf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>14/5</code> Cathedral: I don't actually own this game, but one of my regular
wargame opponents likes it quite a bit, so we play it as a warm up on
a regular basis. I usually lose. But I'm starting to get a bit more
comfortable with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> Soviet Dawn: probably won't play this in 2016, as I have Hapsburg
Eclipse to work through.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/3</code> Target Leningrad: This one will not be a problem to get many, many
more plays in for the year. So far I've been playing solo, but I'm
looking forward playing it ftf. Getting in 9 plays might be
stretching it, but we'll see. At least a couple of plays can be solo
writeups working out tactics. Those are always fun for a long
afternoon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/10</code> Battle for Moscow: Should be easy to get 2 more plays of this in
the next several months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/9</code> StarForce: 3 more plays of this should not be a problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/8</code> Fire in the Lake: 4 plays should not be a problem at all. At
least a couple of plays will result from further study of the
examples in the playbook. (I count working through these in detail as
plays because I spend many, many hours and write it all up.)</p>

    <p>9th play of this bumps H-Index to 9.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/9</code> Flash Point: I'd love to get a group together to go through the
expansions, but it's not that popular among the small group of people
I play non-wargames with. The 10th play of this put my H-Index at 10.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/8</code> Vietnam Solitaire: This is an interesting and unique solitaire
game which has proven really hard to beat. I think I've beaten once
or twice, but at least one of those victories is tainted by an
incorrect setup, too few NVA if I recall correctly. I still haven't
quite cracked it in 8 plays.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/5</code> Objective Kiev: Yet another Chadwick Eastern Front game modeled
on the Battle for Moscow system. This one feels a bit more difficult
than Battle for Moscow or Target Leningrad. It has a few more units,
and the map a few more rows of hexes. As usual, very difficult for
the Germans to win.</p>

    <p>Game 7 (solo) saw a possible German win, possible because one of the
Russian reinforcements "forgot" to enter on Turn 6. It may not have
mattered though, the Germans were really stuck up into Russians, and
had taken Kiev.</p>

    <p>Game 8 (solo) clear German win, get to the east edge of the board as
fast as possible.</p>

    <p>Game 9, now I'm not sure how a good German player could possibly
lose…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>8/0</code> Silver Bayonet, a new game for the year with a mix of short and
medium scenarios, as well as 3 campaign scenarios.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/5</code> Pandemic: Beaten this once in 5 tries in solo play, would like to
reliably beat the 4 Epidemic Basic game, then move to 6 Epidemics, then
start adding the expansions in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/5</code> France '40: Future plays might see small scenario development of
the crossing at Sedan, and Rommel's crossing at Dinant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>6/4</code> Hapsburg Eclipse: I "beat" this game once, except I'm pretty sure I
was playing it wrong to get the win. After 4 plays, the game is
starting to unfold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>5/5</code> Arab Israeli Wars: I want to like this game a lot more than I
 actually do, but the simple scenarios I've played seem to be severely
 unbalanced in favor of the Israelis. I'm still intending on playing
 much more of it, but it's going slower than I initially anticipated.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Due to the 5x5 Challenge, France '40 will get to 10, but it may not get
to 12. That could be something for a future year.</p>

<p>The list is of course slanted towards games which play quickly,
specifically filler games and the States of Siege games, and Chadwick's
ETO series. This is not necessarily a bad thing, momentum is important,
and while I like playing longer games, I don't like playing them all the
time. Sometimes, it's really nice to put something back in the box
sooner than later.</p>

<p>For the filler games, they really are just that: filler. None of the
filler games are played solo, and we never meet with the intention of
"let's play a bunch of short stupid games."</p>

<p>And more importantly, I just don't have time to play longer games right
now, which is really a bummer.</p>

<h2 id="average-plays-for-games-owned">Average plays for games owned</h2>

<p>This statistic is a bit deceptive, as it divides the total number of
games played regardless of ownership into the number of games I own.
A better statistic would average plays of owned games. In any case, this
number is hovering around 5.25, I'd like to keep this average above 5,
but considering the 10 new and 5x5 challenges, that will be really hard.
On the other hand, working on the H-Index will help, especially as
France '40 and Fire in the Lake already have multiple plays, and at
least some of the OCS games might be scenarios from games I've already
listed as owned, such as Baltic Gap and Tunisia.</p>

<p>I used to keep this number up around 8, but there is no chance it will
ever get there again given how many games I have versus the time left to
play them. At some point, I might decide to start playing through my
whole backlog. Then I'll be lucky to even get an average play of 1.</p>

<h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>

<p>This article was written over a period of several months, being updated
as games got played. Looking back on the process, it would have been
nice to keep track of where game counts started to compare to the count
at the end of the year.</p>

<p>One thing which was a bit surprising to me was the number of
non-wargames which crept up the list. This is mostly due to how limited
my time was for playing longer games, and of course, many less opponents
for longer games.</p>

<p>For a point of reference, this is how I'm doing it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reading rules doesn't count for me.</li>
  <li>Setting up doesn't count for me, even when it's a wargame and the
setup takes several hours.</li>
  <li>Playing even a 1/2 a turn solo may count, depending on the level of
effort I put. For example, 1/2 turn in 10 minutes, no. 1/2 turn all
day, probably provided I pack it up and put it away. If I keep it out
and keep playing, see the next.
    <ul>
      <li>1 game play may be over several sessions, which may spread over
several months. Latest example, EFS game started June 6, ended last
weekend, 4 sessions, 1 play.</li>
      <li>Solo counts, for me, if meets above criteria.</li>
      <li>Digital counts if playing real, live human opponents.
Digital against AI doesn't count. For me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Stats are essentially meaningless without qualification. That
said, I'm tracking my personal H-index across all board games. This is
helping me stay motivated to get really good at games I like, or at
least better at them. I'm also tracking average plays across the games
I admit to owning. This is also helpful for getting better.</p>

<p>Wargames are problematic for me as a stats junkie. They take so long
to play. For the future, I'm currently leaning towards playing each
side at least once, keeping it if I like it, selling if I don't.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
