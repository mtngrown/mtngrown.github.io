                Revisiting Vietnam Solitaire
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  8 2016</time>
              <p><strong>Note: I figured out why this was too easy: I made a major blunder
              and reset the Trail between turns. The Trail counters need to stay
              on the map! I was wonderingâ€¦</strong></p>
              
              <p>Vietnam Solitaire is on my H-Index list for a couple of reasons. The
              first is that I haven't figured out a way to reliably beat the game. The
              second is that I usually manage to play something wrong, for either a
              win which is too easy (happened once), or too hard resulting in a major
              beatdown early in the game. This time I intend on going through the turn
              sequence methodically to ensure I don't miss anything, whether in my
              favor or not.</p>

              <p>12 PP total. Going further is a bit risky, but might be worth it.
              Probably the thing to do is one round of napalm if it looks like it
              would result in another Region control, or would deny NVA/VC region

              table. Roll 5 + 2, remove one US unit, which would have to be the
              AirCav, which really, really hurts because that costs 3 PP to emplace.</p>

              <p>+2 for NVA/VC control of Cu Chi for 7 PP total resulting in a -1 DRM.
              For PP, roll 2 -1 for 1, play as normal.</p>
              
              <p>And that ends Turn 2. I think I've made a blunder by not getting as many
              US units on the map as fast as possible, because those units get harder
              and harder to employ as the game proceeds. As long as they're fighting
              with ARVN support, they have a reduced risk of being eliminated.</p>

              </ul>
              
              <p>9 PP for 11 total. Really pushing it here, as Cu Chi is VC controlled
              and will get a +2 PP scoring. Let's put an ARVN in area 6 in Cu Chi just
              in case. That could be a game breaker if the offensive occurs there,
              we'll see what happens.</p>

              Fine. Will use napalm, B52 and GB if necessary.</p>

              <p>Mekong is too dangerous for ARVN to attack into jungle, they only hit on

              PP roll 2, no B52. Bummer, this is a turn which would be useful to have
              them.</p>

              <p>I think I'd rather take my chances. NVA won't be coming into Highlands
              or Saigon, so there's less chance of losing control in those regions,
              and for what I would pay for 2 GB, I can get a US unit on the map, which
              is probably more useful.</p>

              DRM +1 roll 5 + 1 remove 1 US unit, that's doable. US unit comes out of
              Saigon.</p>
              
              <p>At this point I need to finish this game as I have to get ready for work

              <h3 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h3>

              General offensive (roll 6), but hardly anything on the map.
              FWA again control whole map.</p>
              
              <h3 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h3>

              <h3 id="turn-11">Turn 11</h3>
              
              <p>Another double roll for Trail, 2 and 2.</p>
              
              <h3 id="turn-12">Turn 12</h3>
              
              <p>NVA in 2 Trail areas, leave 'em alone for now, deal with them when they
              get on the map if necessary.</p>
              
              <h3 id="turn-13">Turn 13</h3>
              
              <p>Game ends with PP at 14, with FWA control of Hue, Saigon and Mekong to
              move it back to 11. I may have missed an ARVN loss in there somewhere,
              but not more than 1.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>This is the "Rambo" victory condition. In truth, what helped is
              having 1. a lot of double rolls on Trail, like half the game, and 2.
              what weren't double roll, B52 or GB managed to take out 1 or both. That really,
              really  made a difference.</p>
              
              <p>Next game I should play the Special Edition Rules.</p>
              
              <h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>
              
              <p>I suspect the main blunder is not getting the US forces on the map as
              early as possible. What I did instead was B52 strikes, which used up a
              lot of Political Points.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.

              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.

                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.

                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."

                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
