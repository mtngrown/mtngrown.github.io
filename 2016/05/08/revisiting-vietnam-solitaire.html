Revisiting Vietnam Solitaire (9)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  8 2016</time>
<p><strong>Note: I figured out why this was too easy: I made a major blunder
and reset the Trail between turns. The Trail counters need to stay
on the map! I was wonderingâ€¦</strong></p>

<p>Vietnam Solitaire is on my H-Index list for a couple of reasons. The
first is that I haven't figured out a way to reliably beat the game. The
second is that I usually manage to play something wrong, for either a
win which is too easy (happened once), or too hard resulting in a major
beatdown early in the game. This time I intend on going through the turn
sequence methodically to ensure I don't miss anything, whether in my
favor or not.</p>

<h3 id="turn-sequence">Turn Sequence</h3>

<h4 id="a-roll-for-trail-counters">A. Roll for Trail Counters</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Roll 2d6 to place Trail counters in appropriate spaces.</p>

<h4 id="b-attack-trail-areas">B. Attack Trail Areas</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Attack HCM Trail with Green Beret (1PP) or B52 (2 PP).</p>

<h4 id="h-aircav-redeployment">H. AirCav Redeployment</h4>

<h4 id="i-scoring-victory-check-events-roll">I. Scoring, Victory Check, Events Roll.</h4>

<p>And let's play the game!</p>

<h3 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h3>

<p>Things are relatively quiet, no NVA on the map.</p>

<h4 id="a-roll-for-trail-counters-1">A. Roll for Trail Counters</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Roll 2d6 to place Trail counters in appropriate spaces.</p>

<p>Boxcars! Place only one Trail counter in Cambodia.</p>

<h4 id="b-attack-trail-areas-1">B. Attack Trail Areas</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Attack HCM Trail with Green Beret (1PP) or B52 (2 PP).</p>

<ul>
  <li>B52 in Hanoi roll 2, success.</li>
  <li>B52 in Haiphong roll 2, success.</li>
  <li>GB x 2 in Cambodia roll 3, 6, failure.</li>
</ul>

<p>6 PP total.</p>

<h4 id="c-raisemove-usarvn-forces-1">C. Raise/move US/ARVN Forces</h4>

<ul>
  <li>AirCav and ARVN added in Highlands 1-2, ARVN from 3-4 moved 1-2. 4 PP.</li>
  <li>ARVN in Saigon, 1 PP.</li>
  <li>ARVN in Mekong, 1 PP.</li>
</ul>

<p>12 PP total. Going further is a bit risky, but might be worth it.
Probably the thing to do is one round of napalm if it looks like it
would result in another Region control, or would deny NVA/VC region
control.</p>

<h4 id="d-usarvn-combat-1">D. US/ARVN Combat</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Napalm in Hue 1-2: roll 6, fail, +1 PP.</li>
  <li>Highlands, 2 ARVN 1 AC against 1 VC, VC eliminated.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="e-place-nvavc-units-1">E. Place NVA/VC Units</h4>

<p>Rolled 6, no VC placement this turn.</p>

<p>NVA placement: area 1-2 Mekong.</p>

<h4 id="f-insurgency-combat-1">F. Insurgency Combat</h4>

<p>None this turn.</p>

<h4 id="g-nvavc-offensive-1">G. NVA/VC Offensive</h4>

<p>Offensive in Region 2 Highlands, but no NVA/VC, got lucky here.</p>

<h4 id="h-aircav-redeployment-1">H. AirCav Redeployment</h4>

<p>AC to Hue.</p>

<h4 id="i-scoring-victory-check-events-roll-1">I. Scoring, Victory Check, Events Roll.</h4>

<p>Final PP is 12, which results in a +2 on the Political Events (PE)
table. Roll 5 + 2, remove one US unit, which would have to be the
AirCav, which really, really hurts because that costs 3 PP to emplace.</p>

<h3 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h3>

<h4 id="a-roll-for-trail-counters-2">A. Roll for Trail Counters</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Roll 2d6 to place Trail counters in appropriate spaces.</p>

<p>Roll 3, 3, 1 Trail counter in Laos 3.</p>

<h4 id="b-attack-trail-areas-2">B. Attack Trail Areas</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Attack HCM Trail with Green Beret (1PP) or B52 (2 PP).</p>

<p>B52 in Cambodia 5, roll 1 success. 2 PP.</p>

<h4 id="c-raisemove-usarvn-forces-2">C. Raise/move US/ARVN Forces</h4>

<p>ARVN in Hue 3-4 and Saigon 3-4 for 2 PP.</p>

<h4 id="d-usarvn-combat-2">D. US/ARVN Combat</h4>

<p>No ARVN/US combat this turn.</p>

<h4 id="e-place-nvavc-units-2">E. Place NVA/VC Units</h4>

<ul>
  <li>VC roll 3 for Cu Chi, roll 4 for area 3-4 which is occupied by ARVN.</li>
  <li>NVA into Highlands 3-4.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="f-insurgency-combat-2">F. Insurgency Combat</h4>

<p>Cu Chi area 3-4, 1 VC rolls 4, ARVN roll 6; VC roll 1, ARVN roll 4, ARVN
eliminated. Highlands are VC controlled.</p>

<h4 id="g-nvavc-offensive-2">G. NVA/VC Offensive</h4>

<p>Offensive in Cu Chi, intelligence breakdown, no FWA units in Cu Chi.</p>

<h4 id="h-aircav-redeployment-2">H. AirCav Redeployment</h4>

<p>No AC on the map.</p>

<h4 id="i-scoring-victory-check-events-roll-2">I. Scoring, Victory Check, Events Roll.</h4>

<p>+2 for NVA/VC control of Cu Chi for 7 PP total resulting in a -1 DRM.
For PP, roll 2 -1 for 1, play as normal.</p>

<p>And that ends Turn 2. I think I've made a blunder by not getting as many
US units on the map as fast as possible, because those units get harder
and harder to employ as the game proceeds. As long as they're fighting
with ARVN support, they have a reduced risk of being eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h3>

<p>Goal for this turn is get some US on the ground, and not worry about NVA
or VC for this turn.</p>

<h4 id="a-roll-for-trail-counters-3">A. Roll for Trail Counters</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Roll 2d6 to place Trail counters in appropriate spaces.</p>

<p>Roll 4 and 2, Trail counters in Hanoi and Laos 4.</p>

<h4 id="b-attack-trail-areas-3">B. Attack Trail Areas</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Attack HCM Trail with Green Beret (1PP) or B52 (2 PP).</p>

<p>No Trail attacks this turn.</p>

<h4 id="c-raisemove-usarvn-forces-3">C. Raise/move US/ARVN Forces</h4>

<ul>
  <li>AC in Highlands 3-4, move ARVN from 6. 3 PP</li>
  <li>US in Saigon 1-2 for 2. ARVN moves there as well. 2 PP.</li>
  <li>US and ARVN in Hue 3-4. 2 PP.</li>
  <li>US in Mekong 3-4. 2 PP.</li>
</ul>

<p>9 PP for 11 total. Really pushing it here, as Cu Chi is VC controlled
and will get a +2 PP scoring. Let's put an ARVN in area 6 in Cu Chi just
in case. That could be a game breaker if the offensive occurs there,
we'll see what happens.</p>

<h4 id="d-usarvn-combat-3">D. US/ARVN Combat</h4>

<p>Combat in Highlands 3-4, all 5s and 6s, reroll NVA eliminated.
FWA control highlands.</p>

<p>Combat in Saigon, VC and ARVN eliminated. PP +1.</p>

<h4 id="e-place-nvavc-units-3">E. Place NVA/VC Units</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>VC roll 2 for Highlands and 4 for area, will be insurgency there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NVA enter Cu Chi in area 4, Hue in area 3.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="f-insurgency-combat-3">F. Insurgency Combat</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>VC in the Highlands, eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NVA in Hue, 1 ARVN and NVA eliminated. PP +1.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="g-nvavc-offensive-3">G. NVA/VC Offensive</h4>

<p>Roll 4, Saigon, no offensive. Lucky for FWA, losing another unit would
have been bad, really bad.</p>

<h4 id="h-aircav-redeployment-3">H. AirCav Redeployment</h4>

<p>AirCav redeploy to Cu Chi 6.</p>

<h4 id="i-scoring-victory-check-events-roll-3">I. Scoring, Victory Check, Events Roll.</h4>

<p>PP is 14, reduce by 2 to 12 for Saigon and Highlands control.
Placing the ARVN in Cu Chi was smart, this would have been game over if
NVA/VC controlled Cu Chi for +2 PP.</p>

<p>Political roll 6, remove US from Hue.</p>

<h3 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h3>

<h4 id="a-roll-for-trail-counters-4">A. Roll for Trail Counters</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Roll 2d6 to place Trail counters in appropriate spaces.</p>

<p>Another double roll, 5, 5. This is super lucky for FWA.</p>

<h4 id="b-attack-trail-areas-4">B. Attack Trail Areas</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Attack HCM Trail with Green Beret (1PP) or B52 (2 PP).</p>

<p>Not going to attack Trail this turn, will beef up US instead and try to
beat the NVA back as they enter SVN.</p>

<h4 id="c-raisemove-usarvn-forces-4">C. Raise/move US/ARVN Forces</h4>

<ul>
  <li>2 ARVN Saigon for 2 PP</li>
  <li>1 ARVN Hue 1 PP</li>
  <li>1 ARVN Mekong for 1 PP</li>
  <li>AC in Mekong for 3 PP.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="d-usarvn-combat-4">D. US/ARVN Combat</h4>

<p>No combat this turn.</p>

<h4 id="e-place-nvavc-units-4">E. Place NVA/VC Units</h4>

<ul>
  <li>NVA roll 6, no placement.</li>
  <li>NVA enter Saigon area 2.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="f-insurgency-combat-4">F. Insurgency Combat</h4>

<p>No insurgency combat this turn.</p>

<h4 id="g-nvavc-offensive-4">G. NVA/VC Offensive</h4>

<p>Roll 2 Highlands, ARVN controlled, no offensive.</p>

<h4 id="h-aircav-redeployment-4">H. AirCav Redeployment</h4>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="i-scoring-victory-check-events-roll-4">I. Scoring, Victory Check, Events Roll.</h4>

<p>PP is 10 - 1 for Highlands control is 9, no DRM.</p>

<p>PP roll 5, place no US/Allied ground units this turn.
Fine. Will use napalm, B52 and GB if necessary.</p>

<h3 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h3>

<h4 id="a-roll-for-trail-counters-5">A. Roll for Trail Counters</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Roll 2d6 to place Trail counters in appropriate spaces.</p>

<p>Roll 6 Cambodia and 2 Hanoi.</p>

<h4 id="b-attack-trail-areas-5">B. Attack Trail Areas</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Attack HCM Trail with Green Beret (1PP) or B52 (2 PP).</p>

<p>B52 in each area:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Roll 2 for Hanoi, NVA elimnated.</li>
  <li>Roll 1 for Cambodia, NVA eliminated.</li>
</ul>

<p>That was 4 PP well spent.</p>

<h4 id="c-raisemove-usarvn-forces-5">C. Raise/move US/ARVN Forces</h4>

<p>No placement due to political roll.</p>

<p>Move Saigon units to attack NVA in 1-2.</p>

<p>Mekong is too dangerous for ARVN to attack into jungle, they only hit on
1 in the jungle.</p>

<h4 id="d-usarvn-combat-5">D. US/ARVN Combat</h4>

<p>Saigon, let's see who gets lucky: NVA is eliminated, takes an ARVN with
it, PP 9.</p>

<h4 id="e-place-nvavc-units-5">E. Place NVA/VC Units</h4>

<p>VC into Hue area 5.</p>

<h4 id="f-insurgency-combat-5">F. Insurgency Combat</h4>

<p>No insurgency combat this turn.</p>

<h4 id="g-nvavc-offensive-5">G. NVA/VC Offensive</h4>

<p>NVA roll 3, no NVA units here! Lucky FWA again.</p>

<h4 id="h-aircav-redeployment-5">H. AirCav Redeployment</h4>

<p>AC stays put for now.</p>

<h4 id="i-scoring-victory-check-events-roll-5">I. Scoring, Victory Check, Events Roll.</h4>

<p>PP 9 - 2 for 7, -1 DRM. Kind of mixed thing here.
PP roll 2, no B52. Bummer, this is a turn which would be useful to have
them.</p>

<p>It's not looking bad for the FWA.</p>

<h3 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h3>

<p>At this point, I'm pretty sure I can get it to a draw without really
doing much, just lasting 3 turns.</p>

<h4 id="a-roll-for-trail-counters-6">A. Roll for Trail Counters</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Roll 2d6 to place Trail counters in appropriate spaces.</p>

<p>Trail counters on 2 and 4.</p>

<h4 id="b-attack-trail-areas-6">B. Attack Trail Areas</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Attack HCM Trail with Green Beret (1PP) or B52 (2 PP).</p>

<p>I think I'd rather take my chances. NVA won't be coming into Highlands
or Saigon, so there's less chance of losing control in those regions,
and for what I would pay for 2 GB, I can get a US unit on the map, which
is probably more useful.</p>

<h4 id="c-raisemove-usarvn-forces-6">C. Raise/move US/ARVN Forces</h4>

<ul>
  <li>US and ARVN to Cu Chi 6. 3 PP</li>
  <li>US to Hue, +2 PP.</li>
</ul>

<p>5 PP total here, at 10 now.</p>

<h4 id="d-usarvn-combat-6">D. US/ARVN Combat</h4>

<p>No combat.</p>

<h4 id="e-place-nvavc-units-6">E. Place NVA/VC Units</h4>

<ul>
  <li>VC into Region 3 area 1-2. Getting to be a big buildup in Cu Chi.</li>
  <li>NVA enters Cu Chi area 2. Dang.</li>
  <li>NVA enters Hue area 2.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="f-insurgency-combat-6">F. Insurgency Combat</h4>

<p>No insurgency combat.</p>

<h4 id="g-nvavc-offensive-6">G. NVA/VC Offensive</h4>

<p>Roll 6, launch offensives in all regions!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hue: 1 VC 1 NVA vs. 2 ARVN 1 US. 1 ARVN, VC and NVA eliminated, PP
total at 11.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cu Chi: 1 VC 1 NVA vs. 2 ARVN 1 US 1 AC, results: 1 ARVN, VC, NVA
eliminated, PP total 12.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mekong: 1 VC 1 NVA vs. 2 ARVN 1 US 1 AC, results, need reroll (!) for
1 ARVN eliminated PP 13, roll again, VC and ARVN eliminated for PP 14,
roll to eliminate NVA. Mekong now in FWA control.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="h-aircav-redeployment-6">H. AirCav Redeployment</h4>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="i-scoring-victory-check-events-roll-6">I. Scoring, Victory Check, Events Roll.</h4>

<p>US gets -3 on PP for control in Highlands, Saigon and Mekong. For PP 11,
DRM +1 roll 5 + 1 remove 1 US unit, that's doable. US unit comes out of
Saigon.</p>

<p>At this point I need to finish this game as I have to get ready for work
tomorrow and I want it off the table, so that's it for the turn-by-turn.</p>

<h3 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h3>

<p>FWA has complete control of SVN. Amazing! PP at 11.</p>

<h3 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h3>

<p>Trail roll 1, 1, another amazing break!
General offensive (roll 6), but hardly anything on the map.
FWA again control whole map.</p>

<h3 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h3>

<p>GB roll succeeded!</p>

<h3 id="turn-11">Turn 11</h3>

<p>Another double roll for Trail, 2 and 2.</p>

<h3 id="turn-12">Turn 12</h3>

<p>NVA in 2 Trail areas, leave 'em alone for now, deal with them when they
get on the map if necessary.</p>

<h3 id="turn-13">Turn 13</h3>

<p>Game ends with PP at 14, with FWA control of Hue, Saigon and Mekong to
move it back to 11. I may have missed an ARVN loss in there somewhere,
but not more than 1.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This is the "Rambo" victory condition. In truth, what helped is
having 1. a lot of double rolls on Trail, like half the game, and 2.
what weren't double roll, B52 or GB managed to take out 1 or both. That really,
really  made a difference.</p>

<p>Next game I should play the Special Edition Rules.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<p>I suspect the main blunder is not getting the US forces on the map as
early as possible. What I did instead was B52 strikes, which used up a
lot of Political Points.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
