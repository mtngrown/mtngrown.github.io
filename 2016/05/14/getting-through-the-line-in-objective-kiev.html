Getting through the line in Objective Kiev
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 14 2016</time>
<p>I have a theory that Chadwick's little East Front games require the
Germans to get through the Russian line either on Turn 1 or Turn 2 as a
prerequisite to winning as the Germans. My thinking is influenced by
never being able to win as the Germans because I always run out of time
(game turns). For this seventh game, I'm playing solo to see what it
takes to get a clear shot at Kiev by the end of Turn 2. My hunch is that
the Germans need to be willing to take casualties early on, instead
of conserving strength "for later."</p>

<p>Here's the setup:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g7-setup.jpg" alt="Objective Kiev" /></p>

<p>Here's a close up of the line:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g7-setup-frontline.jpg" alt="Objective Kiev front
line" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>The Germans fight first.</p>

<p>From north to south, here's what the Germans are going to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>11 Inf corps attacks across river to hex 0503, on what turns out to be a
4-2-6 mechanized unit. So the odds are 8-2 or 4:1 raw, which is 3:1
across the river, and back to 4:1 with Air. Roll 4, <code>EX</code>, not the best
result, but workable if I stack another unit on it during reserve. 11
Corps advances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>48 armor corps (hex 0203) and 4th Inf corps attack hex 0304 with
4-2-6 mechanized. This is 6:1 for sure. 48 Armor advances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3rd and 14th armor corps attack hex 0403 with 9th Army at 3:1 raw,
4:1 with Air. Roll 3, <code>EX</code>, darn, has to come out of one of the Big Boy
Armor corps. Since 9th Army has to retreat through EZOC, it's now
eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>17 Inf corps attacks hex 0205, containing another 4-2-6 mechanized.
This is not a high odds situation, and is as much to expose the unit
in the woods as to do anything else. This is a raw 4:1 shift left for
woods defense for net 3:1 attack. Roll 5, <code>EX</code>, 17 Corps advances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Down in Romania, the Germans expel a mechanized 2-1-6 and advance
across the Prut river at 6:1.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Lucky rolls for the Russians, an exchange on every roll.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g7-t1-g-breakthrough.jpg" alt="Objective Kiev Turn 1
Breakthrough" /></p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g7-t1-g-closeup.jpg" alt="Objective Kiev Turn 1
Breakthrough closeup" /></p>

<p>The key here is the order in which attacks are prosecuted.</p>

<p>I'm actually kind of OK with just wrapping it up here, I think I learned
what I wanted to learn. I'll play it out anyway, probably without taking
many notes, and definitely with fewer pictures.</p>

<h3 id="turn-1-russian">Turn 1 Russian</h3>

<p>The Russians fall back as fast as they can, and actually manage to put
something like a defensive line together around Shepetovka.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>This will be another curcial turn for the Germans as they do not have a
straight shot to Kiev. However, they can get pretty close, and can block
the Russians from getting into Kiev. They can't block getting
replacements into Kiev though…except Kiev is in an EZOC…</p>

<h3 id="turn-2-russian">Turn 2 Russian</h3>

<p>The Russians are in a real bind here. They get two replacements, but
that can't get those replacements into Kiev directly. They can get them
get them into Cheringov and Uman though, and the replacement in
Chernigov can get into Kiev on its regular movement phase.</p>

<p>Russians can also get a mech unit in Kiev.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Germans taking some big, big risks, going after the Russians with 1:1
odds at Kiev! Also 1:1 in a couple of other places as well. Should be
bloody. Rolled a 6 at Kiev! Attacker loses one step!</p>

<p>Germans need to regroup here.</p>

<h3 id="russian-3">Russian 3</h3>

<p>Russians are doing a pretty good job of boxing in the Germans.
Probably going to be able to take out some big armor.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>I'm just going to play it out now, being really aggressive as the
Germans.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>First German win, barely. It's slightly tainted as I forgot to bring
in 38th Army on Russian Turn 6. This probably would not have
mattered, as can be seen by the photo below.</p>

<p>In short, the aggression paid off.</p>

<p>The key for the Germans is to be really, really aggressive, get the
breakthrough on the first turn if possible, and accept step losses.</p>

<p>At the end of the game the Germans had 6 step losses, one of which was
armor. At one point, all 3 armor corps had step losses. One unit was
chosen to be completely eliminated, 54 Inf Corps. The Slovenian SEA
Corps was also eliminated.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g7-end.jpg" alt="End of game, German win" /></p>

<p>The Germans also rolled up the red line in the east, so only the
northeast corner of the map was available for replacements and
reinforcements by the end of the game.</p>

<p>The German panzers were able to get into Chernikov from an attack on
defenders in 1703 and 1603. The defenders had to retreat, allowing the 1
hex advance. German armor and reserve movement needed only a single hex
to seal the deal.</p>

<p>The game actually shows the bottom of Turn 7, but there is no way for
the Russians to Chernikov back during their turn, so the game is
effectively over.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
