Objective Kiev with stronger Russian position
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 27 2016</time>

<p>Concentrating on first two turns for this set of games:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find optimal attacking configuration.</li>
  <li>Ensure Russian mechanized attack back with 2x, then 1.5x on
  first two turns.</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea is to play several rounds of 2 turns, to figure out optimal
strategy for punching through the Russian line.</p>

<h2 id="round-1">Round 1</h2>

<p>Here's the setup with the Russian mechs flipped after calling all
attacks.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g8-setup.jpg" alt="Strong Russian starting position" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>30 Corps against 9 Corps with Air Support, 6:1, 30 Corps will
advance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4 Corps against 24 Corps with Air Support, will also be 6:1 and 4
Corps will advance. This may turn out to be a mistake, as the
Russians may be able to counter-attack with armies. Eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>48 Armor and 49 Mtn against 8 Corps, 16:3 which is 5:1. <code>DRL</code>
eliminates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3, 11 and 14 Corps against 9 Army at 4:1. <code>DRL</code> eliminates as it has
to retreat through EZOCs established from previous attacks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here's at the end of the Russian special movement phase for Turn 1:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g8-t1-russian-sp.jpg" alt="End of Russian Special Movement Turn 1" /></p>

<p>One mistake was using 4 Corps to attack across river. One of the armored
units would have been a better bet, because that unit could have moved
into hex 0602 and been protected by woods, and from surrounding attack.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>22, 26, and 38 attack German 4 at 3:1 using doubled mech attack
factor. <code>EX</code> eliminating 4 Inf Corps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2, 4 and 5 attack German 48 Armor at 32:10 net 2:1 with woods shift.
<code>NE</code>. Lucky for Germans, en EX roll would have eliminated 48 armor, a
<code>DR</code> would have step reduced at best.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>12 and 19 attack 54 Corps at 2:1. <code>NE</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>NE</code> results sort of suck for the Russians. <code>EX</code> rolls would have
been better for both whittling down the Germans and possibly getting
more eliminations from the retreats.</p>

<p>Germans got lucky even though they didn't completely break through.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g8-t2-end.jpg" alt="End of Turn 2" /></p>

<h2 id="round-2">Round 2</h2>

<p>No photos for Round 2.</p>

<p>Highlights are Russians eliminating 3 Pz from an <code>EX</code> result where it
was surrounded.</p>

<p>However, there was a pretty clear shot to Kiev which had to be covered
by mechanized units because 48 Pz would otherwise occupy it.</p>

<h2 id="round-3">Round 3</h2>

<p>The initial breakthrough wasn't spectacular, but for some reason, the
Russian response didn't do quite enough damage to the Germans. This
allowed the Germans to enter Kiev in Turn 3 with a reduced Panzer corps,
and completely cut off communication by the end of German Turn 4, the
exact halfway point of the game. While there were still 4 full strength
infantry armies behind German lines, Russians called it there. The
Germans would easily defeat in detail the remaining Russian units. The
key is not elimininating the Russians, just reducing them so that they
can't get to 1:1 odds for attacks. With communication cut off, there is
no way for them to get replacements.</p>

<p>Here's the situation the Russians are looking at going into their Turn
4:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g8-r3-t4-german-end.jpg" alt="End of Turn 2" /></p>

<p>Pretty grim.</p>

<p>With all communication cut off, no way to flip those big armies to full
strength. Even if they could bring in replacements, they would be
limited to 1 mech unit per turn.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The upshot is that the Germans need to balance aggression with caution
to be able punch through the line effectively, without losing too many
steps.</p>

<p>Getting to the east edge as fast as possible seems to be the major
strategy. Once supply is cut off, the Russians are pretty well doomed.
In the third round, note that all the Russian armies are still on the
board, the majority at full strength!</p>

<p>It's probably ok to allow the Panzers to take a step loss, as long as
they can be in communication with the western edge once Germans start
getting replacements in Turn 3.</p>

<p>The Russians, on the other hand, attempted to hold the line a little too
long, and probably should have sent the mech units back to guard the
east edge. As long as the Russians can bring in units for replacements,
the Germans have an increasingly difficult time to win it. That is, if
the Russians can prevent an early win by the Germans, they can probably
go the distance.</p>

<p>I'm pretty stoked on this game. I need to find more opponents.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
