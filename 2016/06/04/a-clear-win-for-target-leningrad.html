A clear win for Target Leningrad?
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun  4 2016</time>
<p>Another fast game of Target Leningrad. I'm knocking these out solo in
under two hours. Would be nice if I could knock OCS turns that fast.</p>

<p>I finally occupied Leningrad. I've concluded that Leningrad when defended
only by Soviet Navy and Worker's Militia requires 6:1 every time to get
2/3 of the necessary <code>DE</code>. The problem is that the Worker's Militia can
acquire replacements even in EZOC, so it always defends full strength.
If there are other units there, they can be whittled until the required
30 AF can be brought to bear.</p>

<p>It may be worthwhile risking an <code>EX</code> on the armor as those units can
retreat out of the Leningrad EZOC to get replacements, then move back in
for combat afterwards. No other unit can enter Leningrad if it's in a
German EZOC.</p>

<p>In this game, I did the same thing I did in yesterday's game: cut of the
eastern edge to put the Soviets out of communication on the whole map.</p>

<p>Definitely have more opportunity to explore nuance.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="update-2016-08-30">Update: 2016-08-30</h2>

<p>After playing this game a few more times, I've concluded that the above
game was probably a win, but that I also did not play the Soviets
perfectly. Had I put even one more unit in Leningrad to bolster the LWM,
there would have been no way to achieve 6:1 odds, even with a double
shift plane counter. The mistake I see looking back on what I wrote is
the assumption that other units can be "whittled away." This is false.
The LWM can take all the <code>EX</code> results and fully recover on the following
turn, regardless of line of communication for Leningrad.</p>

<p>The main blunder of any Soviet player is not getting at least a DF 3
unit in Leningrad as fast as possible.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
