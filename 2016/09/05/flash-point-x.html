Flash Point X, with Objective 218
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep  5 2016</time>
<p>This play, my tenth, was solo and resulted in H-Index 10.</p>

<p>I played 3 firefighters: Paramedic, Driver/Operator and Generalist.
These were drawn randomly from the character deck.</p>

<p>I believe this is the first time I've played the full rule set with
vehicles, hotspots and hazmats. I like it better than basic rule set.</p>

<p>The game seemed to go pretty well, then all of sudden a large number of
explosions and I get the collapse endgame.</p>

<p>I only managed to rescue 3 victims.</p>

<p>So, a definite loss.</p>

<h2 id="objective-218">Objective 218</h2>

<p>Later in the evening I cracked open Objective 218. As usual for a first
play, I played it al wrong. However, it takes playing it to to figure
that out. The most important things are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Card must be played on Supply line.</li>
  <li>Card which is deployed must attack if possible, and can only attack
when first deployed.</li>
  <li>The attacked card must be in the target grid of an opposing card
which is <em>not</em> attacking. That is, the card used to target must have
already been deployed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The rest of it seems straightforward. Not sure how much depth there is
here, hopefully a little (for replay value) but not too much.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
