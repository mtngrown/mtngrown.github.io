                Vietnam Solitaire X - Easter Offensive
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 10 2016</time>
              <p>(<em>Note</em>: game finished and logged on September 17, 2016.)</p>
              
              <p>Another go at the Easter Offensive scenario. I've played this one once
              before, last (2015) Christmas day, so I'll be using that as a guideline.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p>First turn, purchased 4 ARVN and placed them in Saigon.
              There's not much to do for anyone until NVA kicks off Major
              Offensive, gains control of all 3 Regions. Bummer.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
              
              <p>Regular turn sequence comes into play now.</p>
              
              <p>a. Trail counters: automatic placement in Region 2.</p>
              
              <p>b. Attack trail areas: 1 B52 in Trail 5, roll 1, success.</p>
              
              <p>c. Raise FWA forces: 4 ARVN into Saigon 3-4.</p>
              
              <p>d. FWA combat in Saigon 3-4: NVA deals 2, ARVN deals 1. More unlucky
              rolls. This could be a harsh game for FWA. Again…ARVN carries it at
              great cost, losing 3 of 4 units.o</p>
              
              <p>e. Place NVA/VC units: Hue is loaded up!</p>
              
              <p>f. Insurgency combat: none this turn.</p>
              
              <p>g. NVA offensive: minor in region 2, no FWA there so just the pieces
              shifted around.</p>
              
              <p>h. Air Cav redeployment: none on the map.</p>
              
              <p>i. Victory, scoring and events: nothing to do here for this scenario.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
              
              <p>a. Roll for Trail counters: Roll 2, already have 2 Trail counters in
              that region.</p>
              
              <p>b. Attack Trail: B52 in R2, roll 2, remove 1.</p>
              
              <p>c. Raise FWA forces: 7th Fleet and Air Cav, that's all the points!</p>
              
              <p>d. FWA combat, pass this turn.</p>
              
              <p>e. Place NVA units: Hue is loaded.</p>
              
              <p>f. Insurgency combat: none this turn.</p>
              
              <p>g. NVA offensive: Saigon, bummer, that's where FWA Air Cav is at the
              moment. Can't use napalm in urban areas.  FWA carry it. NVA Relocation
              puts 8 NVA in Area 1-2 in Saigon region! (This was a mistake, as there
              are FWA RF/PF units in Area 5, so these units should not have been moved. No
              big deal.)</p>
              
              <p>h. Air Cav redeployment: 7th Fleet moves to Saigon.</p>
              
              <p>i. No scoring until the end in this game.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>
              
              <p>a. Trail counter in R2.</p>
              
              <p>b. Attack trail, passing this turn, need to get some units on the map.</p>
              
              <p>c. Raise FWA: 1 ARVN in R1A6, 2 ARVN in R2A6, 5 ARVN in Saigon 3-4.</p>
              
              <p>d. FWA combat: pass this turn.</p>
              
              <p>e. Place NVA.</p>
              
              <p>f. Insurgency in Highlands 6, all units eliminated. Also in Hue 5, ruff
              puffs against NVA regs, ruff puffs eliminated.</p>
              
              <p>g. NVA offensive: none this turn. No NVA relocation.</p>
              
              <p>h. Air Cav redeployment, none.</p>
              
              <p>i. No scoring until end.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>
              
              <p>a. Trail counter in 3, already maxed.</p>
              
              <p>b. Attact trail, will pass this turn in favor of getting units on the
              ground.</p>
              
              <p>c. Raise FWA, 12 points this turn, will definitely need them all. 1 Air
              Cav and 1 ARVN into Siagon 3-4, 2 ARVN Rangers and 1 ARVN AC into Hue 5,
              6 ARVN into Hue 3-4.</p>
              
              <p>d. FWA combat:
                * Saigon: 9 NVA against 7 ARVN and 2 US AC supported by 7th Fleet.
                Start the rolls, round 1: NVA get 5 hits (dang) ARVN get 4 hits, US
                gets 2 hits. Round 2: ARVN 1, US 1, NVA 0 hits; round 3: NVA
                eliminated.
                * Highlands: VC and 1 ARVN Ranger elminated.
                * Hue: NVA gets 4 hits, ARVN gets 5 hits, NVA eliminated from R1A34</p>
              
              <p>e. Place NVA.</p>
              
              <p>f. Insurgency in Hue 3-4, NVA eliminated at cost of 1 ARVN mech.</p>
              
              <p>g. NVA offensive: Highlands, NVA armor lost in the jungle.</p>
              
              <p>h. AC redeploy, move US AC and 7th to Highlands.</p>
              
              <p>i. No scoring until end for this scenario.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>
              
              <p>a. Place trail, R5, will be putting 2 NVA into Saigon this turn.</p>
              
              <p>b. Attack Trail: B52 in R2, so much jungle there for bad odds with ARVN
              regulars, roll 4, 1 trail counter removed. Lucky. Will just have to deal
              with the rest of the NVA as they enter.</p>
              
              <p>c. Raise and move FWA, 10 points remaining. 6 points into Saigon, 4 into
              Hue.</p>
              
              <p>d. FWA combat, going for broke here as I don't see any way I'm going to
              get better than a marginal defeat by holding Saigon.
                * Saigon: NVA eliminated.
                * Highlands, Round 1, VC eliminated; Round 2: another VC eliminated;
                Round 3: NVA and 2 ARVN eliminated.
                * Hue, need to be super lucky here: Control to FWA, we'll see how that
                changes on NVA entry. Overall, pretty lucky though.</p>
              
              <p>e. Place NVA: All land in occupied areas, game will be decided on
              Insurgency combat.</p>
              
              <p>f. Insurgency:
                * Hue 1-2: napalm roll 3, NVA eliminated; Area 6 napalm roll 2, 1 NVA
                eliminated, roll for result ARVN carries the day.
                * Highlands 1-2, US AC prevails.
                * Saigon, will be tricky, but ARVN has the advantage 3:2 in urban
                areas, and carries the day!</p>
              
              <p>g. NVA offensive: if I'm lucky, I'll roll 2 or 6 for Highlands offensive, and
              hopefully US AC will take out remaining NVA…roll 1, nope.</p>
              
              <p>h. AC redeploy, no point, last turn.</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>FWA controls Hue and Saigon, 1 remaining NVA in Highlands for a
              marginal victory.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>Overall, I <em>think</em> I played this one correctly, outside of missing NVA
              relocation on Turn 2. I don't think that mattered for this game.</p>
              
              <p>I had a chance for a major victory had I split the US AC in The
              Highlands. The odds were for it, but much better odds for marginal
              victory, which I chose.</p>
              
              <p>I did get lucky on the last turn for both NVA Placement and Insurgency.
              The entering NVA could well have been placed in area which were not
              subject to Insurgency, nor Offensive.</p>
              
              <p>This is a good scenario, I should play it a few more times.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.

                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
