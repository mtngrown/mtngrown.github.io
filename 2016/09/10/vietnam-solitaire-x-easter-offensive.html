<p>(<em>Note</em>: game finished and logged on September 17, 2016.)</p>

<p>Another go at the Easter Offensive scenario. I've played this one once
before, last (2015) Christmas day, so I'll be using that as a guideline.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>First turn, purchased 4 ARVN and placed them in Saigon.
There's not much to do for anyone until NVA kicks off Major
Offensive, gains control of all 3 Regions. Bummer.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Regular turn sequence comes into play now.</p>

<p>a. Trail counters: automatic placement in Region 2.</p>

<p>b. Attack trail areas: 1 B52 in Trail 5, roll 1, success.</p>

<p>c. Raise FWA forces: 4 ARVN into Saigon 3-4.</p>

<p>d. FWA combat in Saigon 3-4: NVA deals 2, ARVN deals 1. More unlucky
rolls. This could be a harsh game for FWA. Again…ARVN carries it at
great cost, losing 3 of 4 units.o</p>

<p>e. Place NVA/VC units: Hue is loaded up!</p>

<p>f. Insurgency combat: none this turn.</p>

<p>g. NVA offensive: minor in region 2, no FWA there so just the pieces
shifted around.</p>

<p>h. Air Cav redeployment: none on the map.</p>

<p>i. Victory, scoring and events: nothing to do here for this scenario.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>a. Roll for Trail counters: Roll 2, already have 2 Trail counters in
that region.</p>

<p>b. Attack Trail: B52 in R2, roll 2, remove 1.</p>

<p>c. Raise FWA forces: 7th Fleet and Air Cav, that's all the points!</p>

<p>d. FWA combat, pass this turn.</p>

<p>e. Place NVA units: Hue is loaded.</p>

<p>f. Insurgency combat: none this turn.</p>

<p>g. NVA offensive: Saigon, bummer, that's where FWA Air Cav is at the
moment. Can't use napalm in urban areas.  FWA carry it. NVA Relocation
puts 8 NVA in Area 1-2 in Saigon region! (This was a mistake, as there
are FWA RF/PF units in Area 5, so these units should not have been moved. No
big deal.)</p>

<p>h. Air Cav redeployment: 7th Fleet moves to Saigon.</p>

<p>i. No scoring until the end in this game.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>a. Trail counter in R2.</p>

<p>b. Attack trail, passing this turn, need to get some units on the map.</p>

<p>c. Raise FWA: 1 ARVN in R1A6, 2 ARVN in R2A6, 5 ARVN in Saigon 3-4.</p>

<p>d. FWA combat: pass this turn.</p>

<p>e. Place NVA.</p>

<p>f. Insurgency in Highlands 6, all units eliminated. Also in Hue 5, ruff
puffs against NVA regs, ruff puffs eliminated.</p>

<p>g. NVA offensive: none this turn. No NVA relocation.</p>

<p>h. Air Cav redeployment, none.</p>

<p>i. No scoring until end.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>a. Trail counter in 3, already maxed.</p>

<p>b. Attact trail, will pass this turn in favor of getting units on the
ground.</p>

<p>c. Raise FWA, 12 points this turn, will definitely need them all. 1 Air
Cav and 1 ARVN into Siagon 3-4, 2 ARVN Rangers and 1 ARVN AC into Hue 5,
6 ARVN into Hue 3-4.</p>

<p>d. FWA combat:
  * Saigon: 9 NVA against 7 ARVN and 2 US AC supported by 7th Fleet.
  Start the rolls, round 1: NVA get 5 hits (dang) ARVN get 4 hits, US
  gets 2 hits. Round 2: ARVN 1, US 1, NVA 0 hits; round 3: NVA
  eliminated.
  * Highlands: VC and 1 ARVN Ranger elminated.
  * Hue: NVA gets 4 hits, ARVN gets 5 hits, NVA eliminated from R1A34</p>

<p>e. Place NVA.</p>

<p>f. Insurgency in Hue 3-4, NVA eliminated at cost of 1 ARVN mech.</p>

<p>g. NVA offensive: Highlands, NVA armor lost in the jungle.</p>

<p>h. AC redeploy, move US AC and 7th to Highlands.</p>

<p>i. No scoring until end for this scenario.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>a. Place trail, R5, will be putting 2 NVA into Saigon this turn.</p>

<p>b. Attack Trail: B52 in R2, so much jungle there for bad odds with ARVN
regulars, roll 4, 1 trail counter removed. Lucky. Will just have to deal
with the rest of the NVA as they enter.</p>

<p>c. Raise and move FWA, 10 points remaining. 6 points into Saigon, 4 into
Hue.</p>

<p>d. FWA combat, going for broke here as I don't see any way I'm going to
get better than a marginal defeat by holding Saigon.
  * Saigon: NVA eliminated.
  * Highlands, Round 1, VC eliminated; Round 2: another VC eliminated;
  Round 3: NVA and 2 ARVN eliminated.
  * Hue, need to be super lucky here: Control to FWA, we'll see how that
  changes on NVA entry. Overall, pretty lucky though.</p>

<p>e. Place NVA: All land in occupied areas, game will be decided on
Insurgency combat.</p>

<p>f. Insurgency:
  * Hue 1-2: napalm roll 3, NVA eliminated; Area 6 napalm roll 2, 1 NVA
  eliminated, roll for result ARVN carries the day.
  * Highlands 1-2, US AC prevails.
  * Saigon, will be tricky, but ARVN has the advantage 3:2 in urban
  areas, and carries the day!</p>

<p>g. NVA offensive: if I'm lucky, I'll roll 2 or 6 for Highlands offensive, and
hopefully US AC will take out remaining NVA…roll 1, nope.</p>

<p>h. AC redeploy, no point, last turn.</p>

<ol>
  <li>FWA controls Hue and Saigon, 1 remaining NVA in Highlands for a
marginal victory.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Overall, I <em>think</em> I played this one correctly, outside of missing NVA
relocation on Turn 2. I don't think that mattered for this game.</p>

<p>I had a chance for a major victory had I split the US AC in The
Highlands. The odds were for it, but much better odds for marginal
victory, which I chose.</p>

<p>I did get lucky on the last turn for both NVA Placement and Insurgency.
The entering NVA could well have been placed in area which were not
subject to Insurgency, nor Offensive.</p>

<p>This is a good scenario, I should play it a few more times.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
