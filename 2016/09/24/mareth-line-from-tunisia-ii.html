Mareth Line from Tunisia II
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 24 2016</time>
<p>Started Mareth Line scenario in OCS Tunisia II with CC. Our goal was to
get through at least 2 turns, we made it through 3 turns.</p>

<p>This isn't a bad learning scenario for combat and barrage rules. As it's
a siege, there isn't a lot of movement necessary for the Axis defenders,
at least early on.</p>

<p>I did some stupid stuff to demonstrate how combat works and how overrun
works, lost some good units and we left the game with 21 Pz reduced and
exposed.</p>

<h2 id="section">2016-10-08</h2>

<p>Picking up where we left off, we made it through the final 5 turns in
about 8 hours. Here are some lessons I learned while playing the Axis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fueling whole divisions: don't do this when going second and not
moving. I lost a whole SP fueling 15 Pz to put in Reserve for
reaction, but as the second player, this was just a waste as I had no
intention of moving it.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Check the sea cap reinforcement for supply, the scenario is
ambiguous on this.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does Allied air transport capacity in Tripoli imply Allies can fly
in an extra 2 T per turn?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Seems to be key to use reserves to keep stack size a bit smaller in
mareth line, with the reserves available to move into otherwise DG
hexes for defending support.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I think the thing to do in this scenario is punch a hole in the line
and encircle to cut off supply for Axis, as well as bomb the crap out
of the port facilities to reduce incoming supply capacity.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>On the Axis side, spening everything by the last turn allows using
internal stores to finish the game.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what it looked like at the end:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/tunisia-ii/g1-end.jpg" alt="Tunisia II Mareth Line end of game" /></p>

<p>Good game.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="some-light-game-to-close-out-the-evening">Some light game to close out the evening</h2>

<p>Zombie Dice, CC won with an 8 brain run. He liked it! Zombie Dice is
almost as stupid as Pirateer, with the added benefit of being shorter.</p>

<p>Hive (XXVI), suggested by CC. I felt a bit ambivalent about this but
agreed to play anyway. I took white and the win.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
