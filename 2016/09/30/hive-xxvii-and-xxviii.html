                Hive XXVII and XXVIII
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 30 2016</time>
              <p>I set up two turn-based Hive tables this morning on BGA. The first table
              was joined by an expert player, ranked 27th with 28 wins for 29 plays.
              I'm thinking, ok, that's fine, this is going to be a tough game, let's
              see where I can go with it.</p>
              
              <p>Right after I get home, this same player joins my other game!</p>
              
              <p>So I'm two separate games with the same expert player (I'm ranked in the
              high 900s).</p>
              
              <p>This is no fun at all and I sent a message to this player telling them
              exactly that.</p>
              
              <p>I then put my bugs on the table as fast as possible, with no regard for
              any strategy whatsoever, I just wanted out of these games. I probably
              shouldn't even count them, but I'm going to anyway to have something to
              look back on in the future.</p>
              
              <p>Fortunately, this player was online, so we played in real time and got
              through the games very quickly.</p>
              
              <p>Perhaps this sounds petulant, and perhaps it is, but frankly I don't
              care. This expert player got a couple of cheap shit wins at my expense,
              and that's on them, because there is no way I'm in the mood to take on
              the same highly ranked person in concurrent games. Not right now. Maybe
              some time in the future, but not right now.</p>
              
              <p>After these were finished, I set up another turn-based table, and
              fortunately this person did not join it. The person who did join is
              ranked at about my level, which is not that good for improving, but I'm
              sure I'll have a lot more fun.</p>
              
              <p>And that's my goal, to have fun.</p>
              
              <p>I actually tried to concede these games, but the software won't allow a
              concession until the game is half over.</p>
              
              <p>Here's the games.</p>
              
              <h2 id="hive-27">Hive 27</h2>
              
              <p>As noted above, these two games were played concurrently. In this game,
              I think the opponent realized I wasn't going to play him and once it got
              into a race condition he just ran the clock down. I finished two moves
              behind more or less because he didn't care.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Hive game 27" src="/images/hive/g-27.jpg" /></p>
              
              <h2 id="hive-28">Hive 28</h2>
              
              <p>In this game, I believe the opponent was attempting to get clever and
              maintain perimeter control, without realizing I didn't give a shit.
              Game couldn't be over fast enough for me.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Hive game 28" src="/images/hive/g-28.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>This whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I'd like to play
              highly experienced players, and would even consider it a favor, but not
              under the condition of having to play two separate games against them.</p>
              
              <p>Another one of these highly ranked, expert players has played me twice,
              but over a longer period of time. I'm more or less ok with that. I can
              learn from that. Just wasn't in the mood for what went down this
              evening. I wish I could block players. Perhaps it's possible. I'll dig
              around the website, see what I can find.</p>
              
              <p>If this happens again, I'm going to play the first game, and let the
              second game ride until after the first game is finished.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
