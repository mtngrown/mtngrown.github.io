                Binh Dinh '69, a Train Game
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 20 2016</time>
              <p>Binh Dinh '69 is the first of Brian Train's many titles I've played.
              Which is sort of crazy, as I apparently I already <em>own</em> the majority
              of his titles.</p>
              
              <p>This particular game is publlished as a folio edition by One Small Step.
              It has a pretty small footprint with 17 x 22" map and a couple of point
              tracks, one for each player.</p>
              
              <p>I played VC (as usual) against AS's FWA. Both sides need to get
              population on the map, which is represented by "little dudes" counters.
              These are guerrilla and RF/PF respectively. Neither can move or attack,
              but they provide a basis for emplacing forces, and can defend. We didn't
              get a good grip on Lines of Communication (LoC) other than the main
              roads. I believe we missed some details there, worth going into in more
              depth in the future.</p>
              
              <p>We found scoring a bit confusing. Evidently, area control and population
              presence accumulate over turns, which makes sense as the game is
              somewhat open-ended with respect to victory score.</p>
              
              <p>We will, however, play this again.</p>
              
              <h2 id="target-leningrad">Target Leningrad</h2>
              
              <p>This time I took the Germans against AS's Soviets. The opening combat
              for the Germans didn't go quite as well as I had hoped, but AS wasn't
              able to exploit all the DR results he got to get behind my lines to cut
              off communication with the western edge.</p>
              
              <p>I was able to drive the panzers onto the eastern edge, then infantry by
              the end of Turn 4, cutting off all Soviet reinforcements and
              replacements. Once the double air marker came in, I rolled a "2" and
              reduced the Soviet Fleet. As the Germans neglected to keep a strong unit
              in Leningrad, was able to surround it and capture it Turn 6, iirc.</p>
              
              <p>It was a good game for AS to see how cutting off reinforcements and
              replacements is the key for the Germans to win in this series of games.</p>
              
              <h2 id="zombie-dice">Zombie Dice</h2>
              
              <p>We finished up the day with some Zombie Dice. AS rolled 10 brains
              right out of the gate, and I shotgunned my first turn. His second
              resulted with 4 more brains, more shotguns for me. Score: AS 14, Dave 0.
              What a stupid game! So awesome!</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
