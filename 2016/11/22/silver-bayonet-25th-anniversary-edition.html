                Silver Bayonet 25th Anniversary Edition
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 22 2016</time>
              <p>Note: This game was finished and logged on Nov. 25, 2016.</p>
              
              <p>Once again, I start learning a new game while I have another new game
              already set up and running (DAK2).</p>
              
              <p>I have Scenario #3 set up to get started into the rules for this bad
              boy. And it is a bad boy to be sure: it's looking a bit more complex
              than I thought it would be. That's ok, will just need to make sure I
              budget the time for it correctly.</p>
              
              <p>I'm also following along with the play through on the GMT blog.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p>First up is the night ambush by FWA, this is a roll of 7 with DRM -2 for
              5, on the 2-3 Assault table, which is No Effect.</p>
              
              <p>PAVN A/8/66 moves to Hex 1119, along with the reinforcing B/8/66 which
              advance into 2019 as it's not subject to ZOC restraints.</p>
              
              <p>PAVN assaults, rolls 2 for ER, achieves Attacker Coordination, no DRM
              for either side on this result.</p>
              
              <p>FWA rolls 2 on the 2-3 column, PAVN loses a step.</p>
              
              <p>PAVN rolls 6, NE.</p>
              
              <p>Efficiency checks, both pass, another round of assault. FWA rolls 1,
              another step loss for PAVN. PANV rolls 7, too bad so sad.</p>
              
              <p>Since Assault Combat is the last part of the turn sequence in any phase,
              we move on to the turn interphase sequence, for which there isn't
              anything to do for this small scenario.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
              
              <p>Moving on, the FWA places it's reinforcement into the LZ Mary hex. Since
              LZ Mary is hot, need to roll on for Fatigue on entry: roll 10 &gt; 6. See
              also 13.1.1.3 Hot Landing Zones and Efficiency Checks 2.4.5.</p>
              
              <p>There is no point in moving. The FWA decides to implement manuever
              combat against the PAVN in hex 1219. After declaring combat, bombardment
              phase follows, and the FWA have 9 Air Points. The PAVN gets to respond
              with Air Defense Fire (ADF), which is resolved before bombardment is
              resolved. However, given the FWA bombards with 3, and the PAVN only has
              1 step in the hex, there is not ADF. Bombardment proceeds with roll 1
              which is <code>3F</code> for TDV of 3, which is a step loss, hence unit is
              eliminated.</p>
              
              <p>For manuever combat we have 4 attacking 2 defending for raw 2:1. We have
              to make an Efficiency Check against the lowest ER as this is a combined
              attack with both US and ARVN units attacking.  The lowest ER is 6, roll
              6 &lt;= 6, pass, hence coordinated attack. PAVN rolls 9 &gt; 4, fails EC.
              Looks like FWA gets no column shift on ER (6 - 4 = 2), PAVN gets +2 DRM
              for TDV.  Attacker roll 6 + 2 for 8 yielding <code>AF1</code>, which is attacker
              fatigues 1 unit, which is chosen to be the ARVN unit.</p>
              
              <p>PAVN's turn, now brings in remaining two units, one of which is a mortar
              unit, and declares Assault on LZ Mary. First thing is mortar
              bombardment, roll 10 no effect. Now for defensive bombardment from FWA.
              The playthrough I'm following states the PAVN has 7 steps and can
              conduct ADF, but in the images I only see 3.5 steps, so I really don't
              know what they mean by that. In any case, I'm sure that PAVN doesn't
              have enough steps in my game to have ADF, so defensive bombardment
              proceeds with 6 Air Points, roll 6 for <code>2</code> on TDV 2, which is one step
              loss. PAVN coordination, roll 8 &gt; 4, uncoordinated. FWA rolls on Assault
              table with 5 + 2 (more than 50% Fatigued) for 7 on the 8 column which is
              a <code>-</code>, no effect. PAVN rolls 1 + 1 (uncoordinated) for a guaranteed
              defender step loss, which is taken out of the CIDG unit.</p>
              
              <p>Round 2: FWA passes EC, PAVN fails, FWA rolls 7 another no effect on the
              Assault Table.</p>
              
              <p>Victory to FWA with 4 PAVN step losses and occupying LZ Mary, to PAVN 0.
              They were super lame this game.</p>
              
              <p>I need to set this up again and play through it a couple more times with
              rules in hand.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
