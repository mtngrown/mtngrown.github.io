Silver Bayonet 25th Anniversary Edition
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 22 2016</time>
<p>Note: This game was finished and logged on Nov. 25, 2016.</p>

<p>Once again, I start learning a new game while I have another new game
already set up and running (DAK2).</p>

<p>I have Scenario #3 set up to get started into the rules for this bad
boy. And it is a bad boy to be sure: it's looking a bit more complex
than I thought it would be. That's ok, will just need to make sure I
budget the time for it correctly.</p>

<p>I'm also following along with the play through on the GMT blog.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>First up is the night ambush by FWA, this is a roll of 7 with DRM -2 for
5, on the 2-3 Assault table, which is No Effect.</p>

<p>PAVN A/8/66 moves to Hex 1119, along with the reinforcing B/8/66 which
advance into 2019 as it's not subject to ZOC restraints.</p>

<p>PAVN assaults, rolls 2 for ER, achieves Attacker Coordination, no DRM
for either side on this result.</p>

<p>FWA rolls 2 on the 2-3 column, PAVN loses a step.</p>

<p>PAVN rolls 6, NE.</p>

<p>Efficiency checks, both pass, another round of assault. FWA rolls 1,
another step loss for PAVN. PANV rolls 7, too bad so sad.</p>

<p>Since Assault Combat is the last part of the turn sequence in any phase,
we move on to the turn interphase sequence, for which there isn't
anything to do for this small scenario.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Moving on, the FWA places it's reinforcement into the LZ Mary hex. Since
LZ Mary is hot, need to roll on for Fatigue on entry: roll 10 &gt; 6. See
also 13.1.1.3 Hot Landing Zones and Efficiency Checks 2.4.5.</p>

<p>There is no point in moving. The FWA decides to implement manuever
combat against the PAVN in hex 1219. After declaring combat, bombardment
phase follows, and the FWA have 9 Air Points. The PAVN gets to respond
with Air Defense Fire (ADF), which is resolved before bombardment is
resolved. However, given the FWA bombards with 3, and the PAVN only has
1 step in the hex, there is not ADF. Bombardment proceeds with roll 1
which is <code>3F</code> for TDV of 3, which is a step loss, hence unit is
eliminated.</p>

<p>For manuever combat we have 4 attacking 2 defending for raw 2:1. We have
to make an Efficiency Check against the lowest ER as this is a combined
attack with both US and ARVN units attacking.  The lowest ER is 6, roll
6 &lt;= 6, pass, hence coordinated attack. PAVN rolls 9 &gt; 4, fails EC.
Looks like FWA gets no column shift on ER (6 - 4 = 2), PAVN gets +2 DRM
for TDV.  Attacker roll 6 + 2 for 8 yielding <code>AF1</code>, which is attacker
fatigues 1 unit, which is chosen to be the ARVN unit.</p>

<p>PAVN's turn, now brings in remaining two units, one of which is a mortar
unit, and declares Assault on LZ Mary. First thing is mortar
bombardment, roll 10 no effect. Now for defensive bombardment from FWA.
The playthrough I'm following states the PAVN has 7 steps and can
conduct ADF, but in the images I only see 3.5 steps, so I really don't
know what they mean by that. In any case, I'm sure that PAVN doesn't
have enough steps in my game to have ADF, so defensive bombardment
proceeds with 6 Air Points, roll 6 for <code>2</code> on TDV 2, which is one step
loss. PAVN coordination, roll 8 &gt; 4, uncoordinated. FWA rolls on Assault
table with 5 + 2 (more than 50% Fatigued) for 7 on the 8 column which is
a <code>-</code>, no effect. PAVN rolls 1 + 1 (uncoordinated) for a guaranteed
defender step loss, which is taken out of the CIDG unit.</p>

<p>Round 2: FWA passes EC, PAVN fails, FWA rolls 7 another no effect on the
Assault Table.</p>

<p>Victory to FWA with 4 PAVN step losses and occupying LZ Mary, to PAVN 0.
They were super lame this game.</p>

<p>I need to set this up again and play through it a couple more times with
rules in hand.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
