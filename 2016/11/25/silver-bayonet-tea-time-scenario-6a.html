Silver Bayonet: Tea Time, Scenario 6A
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 25 2016</time>
<p>Scenario 6A is a single turn scenario to illustrate how assault combat
works. It's just a few VC units going up against a headquarters and
artillery unit. Sadly the artillery is 155 and can't depress into the
close range of the attacking units.</p>

<p>On with the gameâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>PAVN goes first. There's nothing to do until Combat Declaration Phase.</p>

<h4 id="combat-declaration-phase">Combat Declaration Phase</h4>

<p>Four stacking points wil attack the FWA HQ and artillery unit in the tea
plantation. This will be the larger H-15 main force companies.</p>

<h4 id="offensive-bombardment-phase-101">Offensive Bombardment Phase [10.1]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Declare Bombardment using air points or artillery.</p>

<p>VC use mortar section to bombard with 2 points.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Declare and resolve ADF [14.0].</p>

<p>Nothing here, VC have no air.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Resolve Bombardment.</p>

<p>Mortar section rolls 8, no effect.</p>

<h4 id="combat-reaction-phase">Combat Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>No reaction, FWA needs to occupy hex.</p>

<h4 id="combat-coordination-phase">Combat Coordination Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Attack Coordination [7.0] which may negate declared Maneuver
Combat declarations [8.0]</p>

<p>VC doesn't have an HQ in range, rolls 5, uncoordinated attack. This
means Assault Combat for defender (FWA) gets -1 DRM, VC attacker gets +1
DRM on all assault rolls and efficiency checks.</p>

<h4 id="maneuver-combat-phase">Maneuver Combat Phase</h4>

<p>Nothing for this turn.</p>

<h4 id="assault-combat-phase-90">Assault Combat Phase [9.0]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Defender allocates and resolves air and/or artillery for Defensive
Bombardment [10.2]. Attacker rolls for ADF if applicable.</p>

<p>VC has 11 steps and mortar unit, rolls 3 - 1 for a hit. On the hit
table, roll 4 for <code>-1</code> result.</p>

<p>FWA is going to use all 9 Air points on defensive bombardment. Roll 3
for <code>3F</code>, which is 1 step loss for attacker as TDV is always 2 against
attacker in Defensive Bombardment. The <code>F</code> result only matters for
Offensive Bombardment.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Defender rolls first on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and
applies results immediately.</p>

<p>FWA rolls 2 - 1 for <code>1</code> which is another step loss for VC.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Attacker rolls on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and results.</p>

<p>VC rolls 6 + 1 for no effect.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">4) If units on both sides remain, both sides roll against highest ER in
their stack for Efficiency Check. A roll less than or equal to the ER
passes the Efficiency Check.</p>

<p>VC fails efficiency check with roll of 9, FWA rolls 7 - 1 for 6 which
passes efficiency check.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">5) Units passing their Efficiency Check may roll again on the Assault
Combat Table. This roll is simultaneous, results are not applied until
both sides (if possible) have rolled.</p>

<p>FWA rolls 2 - 1 for <code>1</code>, VC takes another step loss. Bummer for them.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">6) If Defender is eliminated, Assaulting units must advance.</p>

<h3 id="fwa-turn-1">FWA Turn 1</h3>

<p>The FWA doesn't have anything to do, as it has used all its Air Points,
it has no offensive strength, and must remain in the hex (tea
plantation) to fullfil victory conditions. In this case, the FWA wins.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I like the combat resolution. It's a little bit complicated, but makes
sense in the context of Vietnam. It's a little bit easier than combat
resolution for GBoH, feels about par with OCS.</p>

<p>It would be smart to play this scenario a few times to get a really good
grip on the combat system.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
