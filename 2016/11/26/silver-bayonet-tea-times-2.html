                Silver Bayonet: Tea Times 2
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 26 2016</time>
              <p>Here's another crack at the Tea Plantation, this time giving the VC two
              turns to crack the defense.</p>
              
              <p>For this really small scenario, with the PAVN going first, there isn't
              anything to do until Combat Declaration, so we'll start there.</p>
              
              <h4 id="combat-declaration-phase-61">Combat Declaration Phase [6.1]</h4>

              <p>VC units A,B,C,D/H-15 attacking FWA HQ hex in the tea plantation.</p>

              <p>VC declare mortar attack on HQ hex.</p>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">2) Declare and resolve ADF [14.0].</p>

              <p class="turn-sequence">3) Resolve Bombardment.</p>

              <p>No reaction for FWA in this scenario.</p>

              <p>VC roll 2, get coordinated attack.</p>

              <p class="turn-sequence">1) Defender allocates and resolves air and/or artillery for Defensive
              Bombardment [10.2]</p>
              
              <p>FWA goes all in with 10 Air Points. VC resolves ADF with roll 3 - 1
              which is a hit, roll 5 no effect. FWA rolls 3 on bombardment, 1 step
              loss for VC.</p>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">2) Defender rolls first on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and

              <p>VC rolls 4 - 1 (3 attacking hexes) + 2 maybe for Terrain Effects, which
              isn't clear from the rules. This leaves either 3 or 5 as a result, with
              3 as two step losses and 5 as 1 step loss for FWA. Let's play it out
              with 1 step loss.</p>
              
              <p class="turn-sequence">4) If units on both sides remain, both sides roll against highest ER in

              <ul>
                <li>VC roll 4 for EC, which is a pass.</li>
                <li>FWA rolls 5, also a pass.</li>

              <p class="turn-sequence">5) Units passing their Efficiency Check may roll again on the Assault
              Combat Table. This roll is simultaneous, results are not applied until
              both sides (if possible) have rolled.</p>
              
              <p>Round 2, simultaneous assault:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>VC roll 3 - 1 + 2 for 4 which is <code>1</code>, bad news for FWA.</li>
                <li>FWA rolls 5 for no effect.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Once again, the FWA win. I think it would be pretty hard for VC to win
              this scenario, given the amount of air power available to the FWA.
              Perhaps one modification would be to roll for air points with the d10
              at the beginning of the turn. That could really shake things up!</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.

                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
