<p>Here's another crack at the Tea Plantation, this time giving the VC two
turns to crack the defense.</p>

<p>For this really small scenario, with the PAVN going first, there isn't
anything to do until Combat Declaration, so we'll start there.</p>

<h4 id="combat-declaration-phase-61">Combat Declaration Phase [6.1]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Declare all assault and maneuver combat by placing markers.</p>

<p>VC units A,B,C,D/H-15 attacking FWA HQ hex in the tea plantation.</p>

<h4 id="offensive-bombardment-phase-101">Offensive Bombardment Phase [10.1]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Declare Bombardment using air points or artillery.</p>

<p>VC declare mortar attack on HQ hex.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Declare and resolve ADF [14.0].</p>

<p>Nothing to do here for defenders.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Resolve Bombardment.</p>

<p>VC roll 9, no effect.</p>

<h4 id="combat-reaction-phase">Combat Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>No reaction for FWA in this scenario.</p>

<h4 id="combat-coordination-phase">Combat Coordination Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Attack Coordination [7.0] which may negate declared Maneuver
Combat declarations [8.0]</p>

<p>VC roll 2, get coordinated attack.</p>

<h4 id="maneuver-combat-phase-83">Maneuver Combat Phase [8.3]</h4>

<p>Nothing to do here.</p>

<h4 id="assault-combat-phase-90">Assault Combat Phase [9.0]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Defender allocates and resolves air and/or artillery for Defensive
Bombardment [10.2]</p>

<p>FWA goes all in with 10 Air Points. VC resolves ADF with roll 3 - 1
which is a hit, roll 5 no effect. FWA rolls 3 on bombardment, 1 step
loss for VC.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Defender rolls first on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and
applies results immediately.</p>

<p>FWA rolls 9 on assault, no effect.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Attacker rolls on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and results.</p>

<p>VC rolls 4 - 1 (3 attacking hexes) + 2 maybe for Terrain Effects, which
isn't clear from the rules. This leaves either 3 or 5 as a result, with
3 as two step losses and 5 as 1 step loss for FWA. Let's play it out
with 1 step loss.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">4) If units on both sides remain, both sides roll against highest ER in
their stack for Efficiency Check. A roll less than or equal to the ER
passes the Efficiency Check.</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC roll 4 for EC, which is a pass.</li>
  <li>FWA rolls 5, also a pass.</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">5) Units passing their Efficiency Check may roll again on the Assault
Combat Table. This roll is simultaneous, results are not applied until
both sides (if possible) have rolled.</p>

<p>Round 2, simultaneous assault:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC roll 3 - 1 + 2 for 4 which is <code>1</code>, bad news for FWA.</li>
  <li>FWA rolls 5 for no effect.</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">6) If Defender is eliminated, Assaulting units must advance.</p>

<p>Not yet.</p>

<p>FWA doesn't have anything to do, so turn advances.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>PAVN steps up a again.</p>

<h4 id="combat-declaration-phase-61-1">Combat Declaration Phase [6.1]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Declare all assault and maneuver combat by placing markers.</p>

<p>VC assaults with A,B,C,D/H-15.</p>

<h4 id="offensive-bombardment-phase-101-1">Offensive Bombardment Phase [10.1]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Declare Bombardment using air points or artillery.</p>

<p>VC bombards HQ with mortar.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Declare and resolve ADF [14.0].</p>

<p>Nothing here.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Resolve Bombardment.</p>

<p>VC roll 4 no effect.</p>

<h4 id="combat-reaction-phase-1">Combat Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>Nothing here.</p>

<h4 id="combat-coordination-phase-1">Combat Coordination Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Attack Coordination [7.0] which may negate declared Maneuver
Combat declarations [8.0]</p>

<p>VC rolls 9, no coordination for this assault.</p>

<h4 id="maneuver-combat-phase-83-1">Maneuver Combat Phase [8.3]</h4>

<p>Nothing here.</p>

<h4 id="assault-combat-phase-90-1">Assault Combat Phase [9.0]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Defender allocates and resolves air and/or artillery for Defensive
Bombardment [10.2]</p>

<p>FWA goes all in with 10 Air points. ADF roll 5, no hit. FWA roll 2 for
<code>4F</code>, which is 2 step loss for VC.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Defender rolls first on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and
applies results immediately.</p>

<p>FWA rolls 5 for no effect.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Attacker rolls on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and results.</p>

<p>VC rolls 9 for no effect.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">4) If units on both sides remain, both sides roll against highest ER in
their stack for Efficiency Check. A roll less than or equal to the ER
passes the Efficiency Check.</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC rolls 6, no second round.</li>
  <li>FWA rolls 7, no second round.</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">5) Units passing their Efficiency Check may roll again on the Assault
Combat Table. This roll is simultaneous, results are not applied until
both sides (if possible) have rolled.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">6) If Defender is eliminated, Assaulting units must advance.</p>

<h3 id="second-player-turn">Second Player Turn</h3>

<p>Nothing for FWA to do, and they win by dint of remaining HQ unit in the
tea plantation. Those air strikes really helped.</p>

<h3 id="game-record-phase">Game Record Phase</h3>

<p>FWA win.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Once again, the FWA win. I think it would be pretty hard for VC to win
this scenario, given the amount of air power available to the FWA.
Perhaps one modification would be to roll for air points with the d10
at the beginning of the turn. That could really shake things up!</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
