PAVN lures ARVN out to play
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec  4 2016</time>
<p>Met with MW to play some Silver Bayonet today at EGO. He hadn't played
it before, but expressed a serious interest.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the only Vietnam game he's played is Fire in the Lake,
so he may be a potential convert.</p>

<p>We were able to get two games in. The first was the full Scenario #2,
the second was 2 of 8 turns in Scenario #10, which is full campaign
rules.</p>

<h2 id="scenario-2-the-lure-and-the-ambush-plei-me">Scenario #2 The Lure and the Ambush (Plei Me)</h2>

<p>This scenario runs for 7 turns, and simulates an attempt, as the title
indicates, to lure the FWA forces into a position where the PAVN could
either take Plei Me, or block resupply, or both.</p>

<p>During our game, I attacked immediately to get the game going and show
MW how combat worked. The goal was to take Plei Me, which should have
been a done deal, but I rolled really badly. Bad PAVN. The game went
back and forth, a lot of attrition, but PAVN was able to block the ARVN
supply convoy from reaching Plei Me, which was good for some victory
points.</p>

<p>The PAVN also get VPs for not being in contact with FWA at the end of
the game. This seems contrived, but there may be some historical
justification given the pursuit rules in Vietnam 1965-1975. Here, I was
able to get 4 reduced PAVN units escaped, for 4 VPs. The main
ramification is that the FWA needs to keep in mind that engagement
counts all the way to the end of the game, and plan accordingly. Of
course, planning to keep the PAVN engaged puts defensive pressure on the
convoy and on the Plei Me campâ€¦</p>

<p>On the FWA side, MW did pretty well, albeit forgetting to use artillery
as effectively as it could have been.</p>

<h2 id="scenario-10-silver-bayonet-ii-2nd-brigade">Scenario #10 Silver Bayonet II (2nd Brigade)</h2>

<p>This is a campaign scenario simulating the last 8 days, from November
19, 1965 to November 26, 1965. The operation Silver Bayonet II was
conducted by 2d Brigade 1st Cavalry (Airmobile). The objective was to
destroy remaining PAVN units in the Ia Drang valley.</p>

<p>Because this is the last days of the campaign, and the PAVN are fleeing
on foot, the PAVN player gets to use all 30 of the hidden movement
markers. These are countered by the FWA employing all the patrol
markers.</p>

<p>As mentioned, we played the first two turns before running out of time.
Compared to the short scenarios which are mostly slugfests, this was
very much a cat and mouse movement situation, with very little fighting.
I'm looking forward to playing through this complete scenario.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
