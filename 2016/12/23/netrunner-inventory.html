Netrunner inventory
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 23 2016</time>
<p>I like to think of myself as a player more than a collector, but in
truth I enjoy both. The collecting comes as much from having more money
than time, with the good intention of ultimately playing everything.
I've never bought anything "just to have."</p>

<p>In the case of Android: Netrunner, when I started buying this stuff, I
had every intention of playing it. In fact, I started buying it because
a really good friend of mine in another city was playing it, and I
thought it might be something fun to play when we hung out. Sadly, there
is no one local that plays this game.</p>

<p>One thing led to another, and I find myself having accumulated enough
Netrunner that stopping now seems pointless. It's not like I can't
afford it.</p>

<p>Here's the whole list from Fantasy Flight. Items I need are in italics.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure I have both of these now, need to check.</p>

<h2 id="alt-art">Alt-Art</h2>

<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of alt-art cards available, <em>many</em> more than I'm going
to be able to justify spending money on. I may purchase a selection and see
if I can drum up some trades with other people. Not that I know anyone,
but still, I'd like to have the possibility.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>I did make one more stab at LCG with the 2d Edition Game of Thrones. I
have actually played the base game, and it's decent, although it felt a
little bit long to me. My usual opponent never asked to play it again,
so I've not invested any time or money into accumulating the expansion
sets for it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, neither A:NR not GoT plays well solo.  If I go down this
LCG road again, it will be with a cooperative or otherwise playable
solitaire game system. I've read that the Lord of the Rings system
enables both cooperative and solitaire. Perhaps I should have started
with that one. At the moment, though, I have plenty of other games to
play, so I'll worry about it later.</p>

<p>Update 2021-01-01: Since I wrote those lines above many years ago, I've
gone very deep into Lord of the Rings LCG. It's an excellent long term
game, with plenty of <em>non-random</em> expansions, all which tell (or try to
tell) a story. The community is very strong around this game as well.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
