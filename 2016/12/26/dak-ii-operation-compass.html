                DAK 2 - Operation Compass
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 26 2016</time>
              <p>DAK 2. A monster's monster.</p>
              
              <p>I'm naturally drawn to extreme phenomenon, so huge, sprawling wargames
              is a natural fit for my personality.</p>
              
              <p>DAK2 has the distinction of having the most series-specific rules of all
              OCS games. This is likely a consequence of the theater.</p>
              
              <p>Some notes before getting started:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Training: The Compass scenario puts 6 Aus in Training Box #1 and
              2 NZ in Green, Locked. Training Rules are Section 5.5d in Vol. I of the
              playbook. Unlocked units in Training advance at the first turn of each
              month. Locked units do not advance until indicated by the scenario or
              appearance rules. In Operation Compass, both 6 Aus and 2 NZ will stay in
              Training mode as the scenario doesn't extend into a new month. Units
              subject to Training will have a double cirle of green and white around
              their morale factor.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>On Map Airfields: Section 5.0i in the OCS 3.0 rules, Section 5.2 in
              the OCS 4.1a rules. For DAK II, no new airstrips can be built.
              Presumably, existing airstrips could be upgraded spending the
              appropriate SP with an engineering capable unit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Truck Points: In short, there aren't many. It seems absurd, but there
              really are Truck counters with 1T, 3T, etc. That's not a whole of
              beans and bullets to move at once.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Leaders: Leaders are covered in Section 3.10 of the DAK Playbook Vol.
              I. Leaders have various properties, some of which are shared
              with Kampfgruppen and Raggruppementos, but will be listed separately for
              each:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Cannot be DG, but Reactive Rolls cannot be made for DG units.</li>
                    <li>Unaffected by Supply.</li>
                    <li>Never need fuel.</li>
                    <li>Never suffer attrition.</li>
                    <li>Have no step or RE size.</li>
                    <li>Cannot "hide" the top unit in a stack.</li>
                    <li>Can be lost, but never rebuilt.</li>
                    <li>Reactive Rolls allow functioning in a phase similar to how Reserve
              or Exploitation status works.</li>
                  </ul>
              
                  <p>See rules for Leader-specific actions such as Leader Loss Roles,
              Wounded, Captured, etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Kampfgruppen and Raggruppamentos: As above for leaders,
                  <ul>
                    <li>Cannot be DG, but Reactive Rolls cannot be made for DG units.</li>
                    <li>Unaffected by Supply.</li>
                    <li>Never need fuel.</li>
                    <li>Never suffer attrition.</li>
                    <li>Have no step or RE size.</li>
                    <li>Cannot "hide" the top unit in a stack.</li>
                    <li>Can be lost, but never rebuilt.</li>
                    <li>Reactive Rolls allow functioning in a phase similar to how Reserve
              or Exploitation status works.</li>
                    <li>Specific to KG and Ragg, each must have at least one unit of the
              same nationality, and the action rating must be chosen from a unit
              with the same nationality as the KG or Ragg.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>See rules for more details on stacking, fueling, etc.</p>
              
              <p>Let's get started.</p>

              <p>The Italians need to figure out how to prevent that.</p>

              <p>CW gets one 8 point naval barrage on any coastal hex this turn, which is

              Jock Campbell. Checking for attrition, roll 4 on 2 die, pass the
              attrition roll, lucky.</p>

              <p>LibOp barrages with 11 from Sidi al Barrani to the stack of 3 CW troops just

              <p>That's all the Italians want to do for now.</p>

              They're in a bad way here as they're about to get surrounded and cut

              <p>The Italians are in a world of hurt as the CW can simply put a bunch of
              their units out of supply and let them attrit away. The Italians may
              need to make some desperate breakouts to prevent the CW from flanking.

              <p>Now for the meat of this game: the Italians need to move to stay in
              supply, but also to stay in Egypt.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>21 Corps moves west to engage Jock Campbell and attempt to stay in
              trace supply. This evolution required moving off the hedgehogs to
              provide ZPC negation to get the 2T in to let the HQ and the motorized
              unit to move. So while Jock didn't do a whole lot, he did make supply
              for the Italians just a little more difficult. And may still have them
              cut off from trace.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>LibOp and Maletti move units forward, including some units which will

              sitting on the beach (hex 41.10) west of Mersa Matruh.</p>
              
              <p>Babini moved way up at the expense of spending 3T to fuel up.</p>

              prevent reducing the odds even further. Roll for surprise…roll 6 -
              2 with for defender surprise with 6 shifts right for 1:2 attack.

              <p>In short, the Italians need to survive through this turn and bring up

              enough. I think 21 Corps is going to have to fight it out of the trap
              they're, but I don't think they can attack if they end up being out of

              <p>As noted, the Italians are really in for it now. They're best hope it is
              to break through at Buq Buq to re-establish supply.</p>

              <p>Not going to do breakout, as there is no way for me to get those units

              <p>First, LibOp takes a powder, or tries to, without looking like it's
              going to have too much success. There are just too many CW units between
              Sidi el Barrani and Bardia.</p>
              
              <p>The next thing is moving the Ragg. BC and companion units north to
              protect Halfaya pass. There is a risk that the CW will attempt an end
              run, but they may be out of supply if they try it. It doesn't look like
              they thought far enough ahead to be able to do that without falling off
              the end of their supply line.</p>
              
              <p>Air barrage put Jock out of action, again.</p>

              they were unable to get ZOC negation to extend to the coastal road.
              Bummer for the nasty fascists.</p>
              
              <p>As it turns out, 4 units remain, including two stacks which rolled snake

              <p>Looks like the Italians are going to hold out until 1941, unless the CW
              gets super aggressive and super lucky.  In fact, by stacking a couple of
              divisions together, they may even be able to avoid complete attrition
              even in the case they get cut off from supply. Let's see what happens.</p>

              in Egypt, but realistically it would take at least this turn and the
              next, and probably a following turn to attrit them all away. But it's
              Monday, and I need to get ready for the upcoming week, as well as get
              Case Blue 2d Kharkov ready to go for Friday at noon.</p>

              <p>OCS is starting to come together for me. The game system is not
              intrinsically difficult, but there is just a lot of game here.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>And just after I write this, I find I've been playing wrong: organic
              trucks can <em>never</em> unload into a dump. However, if I read it right, if
              they can get within 5 hex draw range of an HQ, the HQ can draw then
              throw to its range from there. In DAK2, this is interesting because it
              seems to imply it's pretty hard to move and fight in the same turn.
              Also, organic trucks can only be used to supply their own divisions.
              This puts a whole new spin on Operation Compass.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Also, I've forgotten to spend supply for defending on the CW last turn,
              maybe more. Will get that right on this turn.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>I've also forgotten to apply armor doubling when applicable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>I did not use Allied air at all, in part because there are so many
              other moving parts to examine, and I wanted to finish this game in the
              time allotted for the holiday weekend. As it is, it went into the Monday
              after Christmas, basically a day longer than I wanted. (I was hoping to
              have it finished up early Christmas afternoon.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Probably DG'ed some CW troops without having spotters on some of the

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.

              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
