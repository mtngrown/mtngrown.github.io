                2017 Mastery Challenge
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 31 2016</time>
              <p>This is the end of 2016, so it's time to start a new mastery challenge.</p>
              
              <p>Last year's <a href="/2015/12/31/2016-challenge.html">2016 Mastery Challenge</a>
              went unpublished until today. This year's
              challenge will be published immediately.</p>
              
              <p>Primarily, I intend on getting my
              H-index to 12, with a head start on 13, then get to 10 plays on a
              selected few games, then to 5 plays on a few others, then play some of
              my as-yet-unplayed Vietnam games, of which I have many. The goes are in
              rough order of priority, H-index first, followed the others in the order
              listed. If games get played out of order, though, I'm not really that
              concerned. I'll have fun no matter what order goals are achieved.</p>
              
              <p>Changes can be followed on github.</p>
              
              <p>Not going to worry overmuch about average plays. I'd like to keep that
              up around 5, but I'm more interested in working through unplayed
              Vietnam games at the moment.</p>
              
              <h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
              
              <p>While the main content of this article won't change much, irregular
              updates below chronicle my state of mind over the course of the year.</p>
              
              <h3 id="section">2017-02-19</h3>
              
              <p>For various reasons, I'm currently without gainful employment. This is
              probably going to change my focus from building H-index and average to
              learning the rules to new games. Learning new games, especially the kind
              of wargames I like to play, can be quite time consuming and
              intellectually intensive. So much so that it can interfere with
              intellectually demanding employment such as software development. Since
              I have what will be a too-brief window of recreational opportunity,
              getting a load of new games to the table makes sense. On the other hand,
              I don't see any reason I won't make H-index 13 this year, possibly
              sooner than later.</p>
              
              <h3 id="section-1">2017-03-14</h3>
              
              <p>Still not working, but having a blast! Or at least having a very happy,
              satisfying time working around my apartment to declutter, doing some
              stairscaping and whatnot. The "learning new games" mentioned in
              February's update is in full swing. I've listed 10 new games over the
              last month. The <a href="/2017/03/13/games-games-games.html">new games goal</a> is
              to play all my non-wargames (which are out of shrink), and get a first play
              in for a selection of wargames which I believe will have considerable
              replay value. I tossed a couple more games on the list because it seemed
              like a good time to get them played. That's a load of games, nearly 30.
              I doubt I'll be able to get through all of them by the time I start a
              new job, but I will have made a serious dent in the list. Once I start a
              new job, I'll probably put my focus back on H-index.</p>
              
              <h3 id="h-index">H-index</h3>
              
              <p>H-index is the number of games played number of times. For example, an
              H-index of 5 means 5 games played 5 times.
              It would be far too easy to fill up H-index with lightweight games, totally
              defeating the purpose of acquiring wargaming mastery. Given that, I'd like to get
              the total H-index to 12, and the wargame-specific H-index to 10.
              Here's a list of the top candidates for getting to H-Index 12:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p><code>54/40</code> <strong>Hive</strong>: This will almost certainly remain my top played game, as
              it's a favorite with one of my f2f opponents, and I'm playing it
              intermittently on an online site against live opponents. I do count
              online plays, but only against live opponents.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>34/34</code> <strong>Ogre</strong>: will probably get a couple of games in this year.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>PanzerBlitz</strong>: Not planning on playing any PanzerBlitz this year
              unless someone specifically has an interest and asks for it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>19/13</code> <strong>Zombie Dice</strong>: I now have both expansions for this game, and two
              people who like to play it locally. We usually get in a game at the
              end of the day. I have both expansions, which provides some nice
              variation in play. This game will continue to rise.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>15/14</code> <strong>Cathedral</strong>: This is a favorite of one of my ftf opponents. I
              usually lose, but I'm getting better by losing by less on average
              lately. And I do win once in a while.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>15/8</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong>: This is in my Dime list below, but I believe it
              will get a lot more plays than 10, as I'm toying with notions of
              small scenario balance assessments. The idea is playing the same
              scenario over and over, while logging the outcomes of each action,
              the end goal being a more quantitive assessment of scenario balance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>13/10</code> <strong>6 Nimmt!</strong>: Another filler game which hits the table typically
              after much heavier fare. Great for more than 2 players as well. This
              may or may not get onto H-index this year (or ever), but the plays will
              continue to increase as its pretty popular with all the people I play
              ftf with.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Battle for Moscow</strong>: Also done for now, although there is a fair
              chance I'll get a couple of plays in as it's a favorite of one of my
              f2f opponents. No harm in getting a jump on H-index 13 or higher.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>12/10</code> <strong>Objective Kiev</strong>: Another one where I'll knock out two or three
              plays successively. The focus going forward will be on how to win as
              the Russians.</p>
              
                  <p>The 11th play of this achieves H-index 11.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Soviet Dawn</strong>: No need to work on this until H-index gets to 12.
              At that point, it's worth knocking out 2-3 games in a row, more
              efficient to play several games while the rules are fresh in my head.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Target Leningrad</strong>: This one is done for now unless one of my f2f
              opponents wants a rematch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>StarForce</strong>: Another game I thought I'd get more plays of. My goal
              for 2017 is to get 2 plays, which will keep StarForce on the H-index.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>11/10</code> <strong>Vietnam Solitaire</strong>: When I sit down for this one, I'll knock out 2 or
              3 games back to back. Once I take the trouble to get the rules
              refreshed in my head, it's good to keep the momentum going while the
              rules are fresh. Also, these next plays will be with original rules.
              I've played the Special Edition and Easter Offensive rules, but
              haven't yet really cracked the game yet. So it's time to go back to
              the original rules and crack that first.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong>: I didn't get as many plays in 2016 as I had
              anticipated. It's a really long game to play out solo, takes a couple
              of weekends worth of time because I always write out the whole game as
              I go, so I can keep track of where I am. My goal for 2017 is to get 2
              plays in, with one of the plays being a 4-player campaign game.
              Perhaps I'll do one more solo game before that to get reacquainted
              with the rules.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Flash Point</strong>: I pretty much only play this solitaire these days,
              haven't had anyone asking for it. So far I haven't gotten into the
              expansions yet, but I think that will be the next step. Good to keep
              it interesting.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>10/7</code> <strong>Objective 218</strong>: This probably won't make it onto H-index this year
              (if ever), but it's likely to get to Dime. It can be played solitaire
              well-enough, but I think I'm going to reserve it for ftf play.</p>
              
                  <p>2017-01-07: On the other hand, we're finding more depth in this game
              than originally appeared during first plays. Looks like it's going to
              get to the table more than I thought.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>11/7</code> <strong>Pandemic</strong>: I hope to play Pandemic with its various expansions
              ftf with larger groups. The both times I've done this, we won, and
              that's too boring.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>8/6</code> <strong>Hapsburg Eclipse</strong>: Part of my Dime list effort below. Doubtful
              this will make it onto the H-index this year, but I'm thinking it
              will get there eventually. I'm having a hard time getting past 15-17
              cards, and that's annoying.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong>: More small scenario development at Sedan and at
              Dinant.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>6/6</code> <strong>OCS</strong> (added 2017-01-15) Normally, I count plays by the
              number of individual, base games. For OCS, it's unlikely I'll ever
              get any single game on this H-index. Any individual scenario from any
              game is basically an all-day commitment. Hence, all OCS plays,
              regardless of individual title, are lumped here together. While this
              might not be "technically" kosher with respect to a strict definition
              of H-index, it serves my purpose for H-index, <em>viz.</em> motivating me to
              develop mastery.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>1/1</code> <strong>COIN</strong> specifically, all COIN games other than Fire in the
              Lake, which is tracked by itself. I like the COIN system a lot, but
              as OCS, it's too committing to play very many games solo, and there
              aren't that many people willing to put in the effort for a major
              game. The single game listed here is a play of Cuba Libre. My hope is
              that seeing this count listed will inspire me to play more of these
              excellent games.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Fire in the Lake is an obvious candidate for advancement, but my usual
              opponents either don't care for it, or don't have time lately to commit
              to the effort of playing it. Solo play is really committing, takes many,
              many hours to complete a play.</p>
              
              <p>There may be other games that get added to this list as the year goes
              by. For example, in 2016, Hive and Silver Bayonet were both games I
              enjoyed playing enough to add on to the H-index, as I'm reasonably
              confident I'll play both many more times.</p>
              
              <h3 id="average-of-plays-versus-owned-games">Average of plays versus owned games</h3>
              
              <p>The following statistic is more or less meaningless, as I don't list
              games as "owned" until I get a play logged. Further, I count plays of
              games I don't own into the average. However, these shenanigans help me
              stay focused and motivated to keep a good balance between always playing
              the same old games, versus always playing something new.</p>
              
              <p><strong>2017-03-15</strong>: Current average plays for count of owned games: <code>461 / 81 = 5.69</code>.</p>
              
              <h3 id="dimes">Dimes</h3>
              
              <p>Dimes are games with 10 total plays. Here's a list of games which I
              anticipate playing to dime status.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong></li>
                <li>
                  <p><code>14/8</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong> <a href="/2017/01/15/silver-bayonet-theory-crafting-tea-time.html">Games 9, 10, 11 and

                  <p>10th play on 2017-01-15.</p>
              
                  <p>Ok, so many of the Silver Bayonet games were very small scenarios,
               some of them just a single turn. However, along with playing those
               scenarios multiple times, I've been taking notes on them and working
               through some of the statistics. It's really a lot of work. Check the
               linked articles for details.</p>

                  <p><code>10/7</code> <strong>Objective 218</strong> started out as very low priority, without much intention
              to play it, but two things have changed my mind about it. The first is I
              have a regular opponent who really likes it. The second is the he and I
              both are discovering that there's quite a bit more game here than it
              first appears. So I'm pretty sure this will make the dime, and may even
              move right on up the H-index after all. <a href="/2017/01/07/loads-of-light-games.html">Game

              <p>That's 15 total games to play, doable depending on work status. There

              <p>Nickels are game with 5 plays total. Here's a list of games I anticipate
              getting to nickel status.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><code>2/2</code> <strong>Winter War</strong>: From the end of my last play, I think I've cracked
              it for the Soviets. These next plays are most likely solitaire as I
              explore the Finnish response to the Russians getting through the
              Mannerheim line very quickly.</li>
                <li><code>4/4</code> <strong>A Study in Emerald</strong>: this can be played solo, much more fun with
              a group. I would play this a lot more if I could find 3 people who
              liked it to play it on a regular basis.</li>
                <li><code>1/0</code> <strong>Arduous Beginning</strong>: The last of Chadwick's East Front games,
              which I've been putting off. I suspect this will end up on the
              H-index, but probably not this year. <a href="/2017/03/14/the-arduous-beginning-1.html">Game

                <li>
                  <p><code>5/1</code> <strong>Phantom Leader</strong>: a new solo game exploring the air war
              against North Vietnam between ~1965-1972. I've followed along with the
              playthrough in the rules, and it looks really, really good, with good
              replayability. Should not be hard to get 5 plays in over the next
              year. <a href="/2017/02/28/phantom-leader-linebacker-kickoff.html">Game 2</a>,

                </li>
                <li><code>2/2</code> <strong>Year of the Rat</strong> (added 2017-01-16): I'm not sure how easy
              this is to play solo, but I'm going to give it try. I've added it
              because it's a cool little game, full of hard decisions on both sides,
              and plays fairly quickly with two players.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>The list show 21 total games to play, which isn't that bad at all in
              terms of number of games. The challenge is maintaining interest in
              playing all of these 5 times. I do not expect I'll succeed at all the
              nickels, but I'm sure I'll knock out a few.</p>
              
              <h3 id="vietnam">Vietnam</h3>
              
              <p>I intend on playing at least 5 new-to-me Vietnam games in 2017, of which
              3 will be obscure or vintage. The obscure and vintage plays are solo
              efforts, I'd prefer not to burn out any of my usual opponents on games
              they aren't really interested in, and which, to be perfectly honest,
              aren't very well developed.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
