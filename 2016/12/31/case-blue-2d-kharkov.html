Case Blue 2d Kharkov
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 31 2016</time>
<p>Case Blue. Another monster's monster.</p>

<p>I'd had the 2d Kharkov scenario OOB sorted for months, and my usual
opponent for these sorts of games, CC, mentioned he wanted to play some
OCS or similar fairly heavy weight game. Case Blue 2d Kharkov sprang to
mind immediately, it was an easy sell to him.</p>

<p>The week before we played, I set everything up so we would be able to
jump right in and play. We budgeted 2 full days for the effort, noon to
8 pm on Dec. 30, and 10 am to 10 pm on Dec. 31, 2016. Can't think of a
better way to close out the year.</p>

<p>I also stocked up on food the weekend before, so we had an enormous
amount of vittles available. As it turned out, we more than we could
eat, but that's a good problem to have. Sucks to break in the middle of
a game to go get food, hurts the flow. As a treat, I also picked up some
heavy cream and made very strong sweet black tea with lots of cream.</p>

<p>Here's the setup on May 12, 1942:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/case-blue/scenario-2/g1-setup.jpg" alt="Case Blue 2d Kharkov set up" /></p>

<p>This is the top of Turn 5, where my Russians realized their failure and
conceded the game. There would be just no way to get enough VPs in the
turn such that the upcoming German half turn couldn't get them back.</p>

<p>As you can see, the Soviet salient south of Kharkov has pulled way back.
Unfortunately, they can't pull all the way back west of the Donets
river, as having units east of the Donets prevent 10 German VPs.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/case-blue/scenario-2/g1-end.jpg" alt="Case Blue 2d Kharkov end of game" /></p>

<p>It turns out the Strategy &amp; Tactics game <em>Kharkov</em> models this same
scenario. It will be interesting to play through that game as well, and
see how it plays out. Presumably there is a viable strategy for Soviet
victory in that game.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
