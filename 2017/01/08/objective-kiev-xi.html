<p>Now that I know how to win this as the Germans, it's time to figure out
how to win it as the Russians, or at least how to force a draw.</p>

<p>The Soviets initially put 4 armies on the Polish line, constrained by
the limitation that two armies cannot set up next to each other. This
allowed the Germans to punch through at 0304, after eliminating the
Soviet mechanized units at 0305 and 0403, with ending positions as shown
on the image below.</p>

<p>However, on the Soviet Rail segment, this position allowed the Soviet
6th Army to move from 0406 to 0405 which EZOCS any retreat by the German
panzers.</p>

<p>Here is the situation after Soviet Rail segment:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g11-t1-soviet-attack1.jpg" alt="Game 11, Turn 1 Soviet attack on
hex..." />.</p>

<p>The Soviets have doubled attack strength for all mechanized on the first
turn, so it makes sense to use it. Note the the 2, 4, and 8 mechanized
attacking 14 Pz Corps were moved into place blind, the Soviet player
(me) did not know what the strengths of these units would be. As it
turns out, the doubled strength totals to 36, which is 3:1, reduced to
2:1 with 14 Pz in wooded terrain, and the Soviets roll a 1 for <code>DR</code>.</p>

<p>14 Pz is eliminated.</p>

<p>It will take two turns to get 14 Pz back to full strength as it has to
come back in at half strength on its replacement turn.</p>

<p>Sweet result for the Soviets.</p>

<p>In the end it did the Soviets little good, as the Germans booted them
out of Kiev on the last turn. They did survive it despite being
surrounded on 5 sides, because there were 3 steps: 2 for the Soviet
Army, 1 step for mechanized unit. The result was <code>DRL</code>, the second step
loss from retreating through EZOC, but there was 1 hex not EZOC'ed which
allowed the mech unit to survive. Not that it mattered for the win.</p>

<p>Here's the final result:</p>

victory" />.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
