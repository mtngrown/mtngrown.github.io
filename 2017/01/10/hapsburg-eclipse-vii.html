Hapsburg Eclipse VII
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 10 2017</time>
<p>For whatever reason, I seem to have difficulty getting all the rules
straight for these States of Siege games, all two of them I've played.
I'd like to actually fairly beat Hapsburg Eclipse, or at least
understand how to win. I think I won an earlier game, but played messed
up some rules in my favor, can't recall, it's probably logged here.</p>

<p>The following game will take place over several days, I'm playing a few
cards after work every day, no hurry.</p>

<p>My goals for this game are to really dig into the rules, and to get the
Resource +1 counters on the board ASAP.</p>

<p>Let's flip a card and get started.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>06</code> Russian Cipher Cracked. Croat advances. Spend 2 actions to place
+1 DRM in Western Theater.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>03</code> Battle of Cer (defeat). Trigger Croat (no advance), advance Carpathian
but repel advance on single action. Purchase another +1 DRM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>02</code> Drive into Galicia. Since this is -1 on all offensives, picked
up another +1 DRM with the 2 actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>09</code> Battle of the Falkland Islands (lost). Carpathian now at Premesyl.
Turns out I have been playing it wrong, the Fortress doesn't count as
occupied unless it's completely reduced. So I don't lose the victory
points right away.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>35</code> German Aid` +2 markers. Carpathian stays on Prem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>04</code> Battle of Mons (lost), no successful offensives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15</code> Treaty of London. War Status moved, add Day cards, place
Italians. Carpathians advance, but get beaten back to London.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10</code> German 9th Army. Polish and Carpathian offensives succeed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>25</code> Death of Franz Josef. Purchase another Resource counter.
I'm starting to skate on thin ice here, need to start adjusting
loyalties back, or, winning some battles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>21</code> Brusilov Offensive. Hungarians go into revolt. This needs to be
solved as it puts -1 DRM on Carpathian, which I need to get back to
Premesyl to get the Russia Tires victory. One offensive canceled with
Radio Intercepts. Hungarians stay in revolt with a roll of 2 on
Loyalty. Carpathian offensive with +1 ahead of Prem, +2 German Aid,
-1 Hungarian Revolt, net +2, rolled a natural 6. I'm at -4 National
Will, this is not good, I need to win some battles to get it back up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>18</code> Von Lettow-Vorbeck (won). Czech revolt, squashed. Hungarian
revolt squashed. Prem reduced to 2/3. National Will -2. Need to send
the Italians back before they get stronger, they're two advances from
Vienna.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12</code> Battle of Dogger Bank (lost). Czech into revolt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>05</code> Battle of Tannenberg (win). Czech revolt squashed. Carpathian
offensive succeeds. National Will -3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>26</code> Fighting in the Trentino (lost). Rolled natural 1 on Italian
Offensive, not good. Technically, with the collapse of Prem, I've
lost the game right here with a -7 National Will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>08</code> Battle of Lodz (won).  Winning Lodz and
pushing Carpathian back one space puts me at NW -5.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to call the game here though. It got off to a rough start, I
didn't win any of the first several battles, so I've been in a hole the
entire game.</p>

<h2 id="final-score">Final Score</h2>

<p>I always forget to score these games, so I'm writing up the final score
paragraph before starting the game so that I'll remember it this time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>35 cards left in to play.</li>
  <li>NW -7</li>
</ul>

<p>Score 42, a Crushing Defeat. Boo.</p>

<p>Actually, collapse of National Will is automatically a crushing defeat,
but that's how I usually lose this game.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
