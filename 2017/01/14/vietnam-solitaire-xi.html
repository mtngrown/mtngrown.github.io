                Vietnam Solitaire XI
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 14 2017</time>
              <p>Vietnam Solitaire is one of my H-index games, and a game which I still
              haven't really cracked. So, it's worth playing for more than one reason.</p>
              
              <p>Rereading the original rules, I see that I've probably made a mistake in
              the past by allowing more than one trail counter in an area. This makes
              the game a lot harder.</p>
              
              <p>The goal for this Game 11 is to play the original rules through
              perfectly. I'm planning on playing several times this year, and I'll
              worry about beating the system once I have the rules down.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1-1963">Turn 1 1963</h2>
              
              <p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: 1/1, lucky! There are already Trail counters
              in Haiphong, so no new Trail counters emplaced.</p>
              
              <p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: Hanoi miss, Haiphong hit.</p>
              
              <p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: 7 ARVN spread to all provinces, cities and paddies.</p>

              PP, no ARVN or US units lost, roll 3 + 1 (PP 10), no B52 or GB for next
              turn. That's fine, I'll get all the ground units down.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-2-1964">Turn 2 1964</h2>
              
              <p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: Place trail into 1 and 4. Bummer, this
              is three NVA coming on to the map this turn.</p>
              
              <p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: No B52 or GB this turn.</p>

              <p>D. <strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>: Napalm in Highlands. If this succeeds, should get
              the PP back from having no NVA/VC in region. Success. PP marker on 11.</p>
              
              <p>E. <strong>Place NVA/VC Units</strong>: VC placed into Hue 3-4, NVA into Hue 1-2 and 3-4, Cu Chi 6.</p>

              controlled by FWA, not bad, roll 2 with no DRM, no B52 next turn.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-3-1965">Turn 3 1965</h2>
              
              <p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: Roll 5, 2 place new Trail counter in
              Region 5. There are now 4 Trail counters on the map.</p>
              
              <p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: 1 GB attack Hanoi Trail, roll 5, fail.</p>
              
              <p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: 3 US into Hue and Cu Chi</p>

              Mekong, ARVN prevails.</p>
              
              <p>G. <strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong>: Roll 5 for Mekong, no offensive.</p>
              
              <p>H. <strong>AirCav Redeployment</strong>: None.</p>
              
              <p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>: +1 for FWA control of
              Mekong and Highlands. PP at 10, roll 3 + 1 for no B52 or GB attacks on
              Trail next turn.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-4-1966">Turn 4 1966</h2>
              
              <p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: Roll 4, 6 place Trail counter into
              Mekong, 5 Trail counters now on the map.</p>
              
              <p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: No GB or B52 this turn.</p>
              
              <p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: Emplace US and AirCav. Moved some ARVN
              around to hopefully better deal with any upcoming combats.</p>
              
              <p>D. <strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>: Throw some napalm into Cu Chi 5, roll 5 for a

              Chi 2, Saigon 3, Mekong 5.</p>
              
              <p>F. <strong>Insurgency Combat</strong>: Hue, US prevails. Saigon, ARVN prevails.</p>
              
              <p>G. <strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong>: Mekong, NVA move to Area 6, engage ARVN, ARVN
              prevails, lucky!</p>

              Mekong and Highlands. Roll with no DRM, no B52 next turn.</p>
              
              <p>At this point, I'm pretty sure I can get to 7 turns and avoid the worst
              defeat.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-5-1967">Turn 5 1967</h2>

              <p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: Nothing to raise. Move AC to Cu Chi,
              will be more NVA coming in here. Move some ARVN around to get some

              <p>D. <strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>: Napalm Hue 5 roll 4, remove NVA. Napalm Hue 2,

              <p>G. <strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong>: Roll 5 Mekong, no NVA/VC remaining in Mekong,

              <p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: Roll 2 and 4, no new Trail counters
              placed, lucky again!</p>
              
              <p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: B52 on Hanoi and Haiphong, both succeed.</p>
              
              <p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: Not going to emplace ARVN, almost
              surely will lose FWA unit this turn. Move AC from Hue 6 to Cu Chi 6.</p>
              
              <p>D. <strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>: None, not going to risk anything given upcoming
              placements.</p>

              <p>I've made it past Heavy Defeat. If I can survive to start Turn 9, I can
              claim a draw. We'll see how it goes.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-7-1969">Turn 7 1969</h2>

              <p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: I have B52 and GB… but PP starts at 7, so
              little room for error here. I think I'll leave the Trail alone this turn
              and spend to emplace ARVN next turn.</p>
              
              <p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: Spend 2 PP to put more ARVN in Hue.</p>

              VC prevail over ARVN for VC control.</p>
              
              <p>H. <strong>AirCav Redeployment</strong>: FLy into Highlands 3-4 to deny VC control.

              <p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: Roll 6 and 2, Trail marker back into

              dangerously, FWA prevails, hopefully will retain control of Highlands on
              placement.</p>
              
              <p>E. <strong>Place NVA/VC Units</strong>: VC placed into 1-2 in Highlands, bummer for
              FWA. Maybe there will be an offensive here. NVA into Hue 2 and 5, Cu Chi

              into Hue 2 and 6, Cu Chi 5, Saigon 6, Mekong 2. Lot of NVA on the map

              <p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>: PP is 12, 0 DRM, roll 4 +
              2, remove 1 US unit, will be the 3-3-3 in Hue 6, leaving the AC on the
              board for now.</p>
              
              <p>Depending on what happens on the NVA Offensive phase, I may be able to
              squeak out a victory. If I roll a 6, there is almost no way I'll get
              through Turn 10 without exceeding 14 PP.</p>

              placed.</p>
              
              <p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: No Trail attacks this turn. I do have B52,
              but with 2 PP to deploy, I don't think I can do enough damage to matter.</p>
              
              <p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: 1 ARVN into Mekong 6.</p>

              <p>F. <strong>Insurgency Combat</strong>: Cu Chi 3-4, NVA prevail, PP at 12, uh oh.</p>
              
              <p>G. <strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong>: Mekong 6, FWA prevail with one ARVN loss.</p>
              
              <p>H. <strong>AirCav Redeployment</strong>: Redeploy to Cu Chi 6 from Highlands 6 to
              deny NVA control of Cu Chi.</p>
              
              <p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>: PP 13, that's a Victory
              for the FWA, narrow, but clean and exactly on the rules as best as I can
              determine. PP roll 6 + 2 remove 23 ID from Hue 6. That's pretty much the
              game unless the NVA roll super bad.</p>

              and that's it for NVA, no more units to place in this game, all 15 are
              on the board.</p>
              
              <p>F. <strong>Insurgency Combat</strong>: Hue 3-4 ARVN prevails.</p>

              <p>Amazing I got through this turn with as little damage as I did. If I get

              <p>E. <strong>Place NVA/VC Units</strong>: VC into Highlands 1-2. NVA into Cu Chi 3-4.
              There is only 1 NVA available, so I rolled to determine which Trail
              region to bring it in on.</p>

              <p>H. <strong>AirCav Redeployment</strong>: Only one AC on the map, in Mekong 6. Moving
              this to Cu Chi doesn't solve anything.</p>
              
              <p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>: With NVA in control of Cu
              Chi, PP are at 15, so it's game over here.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>It's an FWA win, "Good Morning Vietnam."</p>
              
              <p>Played this one very, very conservatively, with very little offensive
              action by the FWA.</p>
              
              <p>I was very careful going through the rules on each turn as well. Game
              play went pretty slow as I read and reread every rules section on almost
              every turn.</p>
              
              <p>Definitely learned about AirCav redeployment, never used that correctly
              in the past.</p>
              
              <p>The game would have ended much earlier had the NVA rolled for a general
              offensive, so this was very lucky for FWA.</p>
              
              <p>As it turns out, had I placed just one ARVN in Mekong, I would have been
              able to move AirCav into Cu Chi and get "Rambo" victory. Something to
              think about for next time.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
