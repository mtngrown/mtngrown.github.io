Silver Bayonet - Theorycrafting Tea Time
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 15 2017</time>
<p>This article documents an experiment I'm conducting on game mechanics
related to <a href="/2017/01/01/developing-the-very-small-scenario.html">small scenario
design</a>.</p>

<p>The main idea is that really small scenarios should provide the
statistically likely outcome as a Draw condition, with statistical
outliers favoring each side determing Win/Lose conditions.</p>

<p>Apparently this activity is known as "theory crafting" within certain
communities. I've always called it "statistical analysis."</p>

<p>For this first attempt, we'll be using Scenario #6 "Tea Time" from GMT's
<em>Silver Bayonet</em>. Tea Time is a 1 or 2 turn scenario with about a dozen
counters, and demonstrates only the assault combat mechanics of the
game. The initial goal is to play this scenario several times recording
the outcome for all die rolls.</p>

<p>Tea Time has two variations. The first is a single turn with 10 Air
Points for the FWA defenders, the second is two turns with 10 Air Points
for the FWA defenders each turn.</p>

<h2 id="result-of-4-plays">Result of 4 plays</h2>

<p>I played the Catecka Tea Plantation scenario four times back to back,
recording the results of every phase of the Turn Sequence. The results
are given in the following table:</p>

<table class="scenario-table center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Â </th>
      <th>FWA step loss</th>
      <th>PAVN step loss</th>

<p>Each play follows a turn sequence reduced from the full turn sequence,
as neither side need (or can) move.</p>

<h2 id="game-1">Game 1</h2>

<h3 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Situation at the beginning of the turn.</p>

<p>Per the setup, the FWA have an HQ and a 155 in the tea plantation hex.
Neither of these units are going to move, they have to just sit there
and take the punishment.</p>

<h3 id="initial-phase">Initial Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Adjust FWA Air Points [11.0]</p>

<p>FWA receives 10 AP.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Remove "First" and "Final" Fire markers for BOTH sides.</p>

<p>Not necessary for 1 turn variant.</p>

<h3 id="pavn-player-turn">PAVN Player Turn</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">PAVN player's plans for this turn.</p>

<p>The VC is the first player this turn, plan is to assault the HQ and 155
arty in the tea plantation hex.</p>

<h4 id="combat-declaration-phase-61">Combat Declaration Phase [6.1]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Declare all assault and maneuver combat by placing markers.</p>

<p>Assault by all VC on tea plantation hexes.</p>

<h4 id="offensive-bombardment-phase-101">Offensive Bombardment Phase [10.1]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Declare Bombardment using air points or artillery.</p>

<p>This is where the Scenario 6 formally begins. The VC mortar unit
declares bombardment on tea plantation.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Declare and resolve ADF [14.0].</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Resolve Bombardment.</p>

<p>The VC have 2 bombardment points from a mortar unit. There do not appear
to be any DRM firing into the tea plantation, so the VC need a natural 1
roll to get a step loss, a 1 or 2 to get an <code>F</code>. The roll here is a 4,
which is <code>1</code>, which is no effect with tea plantation TDV 2.</p>

<h4 id="combat-coordination-phase">Combat Coordination Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Attack Coordination [7.0] which may negate declared Maneuver
Combat declarations [8.0]</p>

<p>The VC are PAVN, and here operating outside the range of a HQ. The
coordination roll need to be 3 or less to acquire assault coordination.
The roll is 9, so no coordination.</p>

<h4 id="assault-combat-phase-90">Assault Combat Phase [9.0]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Defender allocates and resolves air and/or artillery for Defensive
Bombardment [10.2]</p>

<p>FWA uses all 10 air points for defensive bombardment. PAVN ADF roll 10,
No Effect. FWA rolls 7 for <code>2</code>, with TDV always 2 on defensive
bombardment, the VC take a step loss.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Defender rolls first on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and
applies results immediately.</p>

<p>FWA defending with 3, gets a -1 DRM for attacker uncoordinated, roll 3 -
1 for an attacker step loss.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Attacker rolls on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and results.</p>

<p>VC assaulting with 11, roll 8 + 1 (uncoordinated) - 1 (more than 2
hexes attacking) for no effect.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">4) If units on both sides remain, both sides roll against highest ER in
their stack for Efficiency Check. A roll less than or equal to the ER
passes the Efficiency Check.</p>

<p>VC roll 10 for ER check on second round, FWA rolls 9, so no second round
of assault combat for either side.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">5) Units passing their Efficiency Check may roll again on the Assault
Combat Table. This roll is simultaneous, results are not applied until
both sides (if possible) have rolled.</p>

<p>Failed efficiency check, no second round.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">6) If Defender is eliminated, Assaulting units must advance.</p>

<p>Defender still occupies tea plantation.</p>

<h3 id="fwa-player-turn">FWA Player Turn</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">FWA player's plans for this turn.</p>

<h4 id="offensive-bombardment-phase-101-1">Offensive Bombardment Phase [10.1]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Declare Bombardment using air points or artillery.</p>

<p>No bombardment as all Air Points used in defensive bombardment last
turn.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Declare and resolve ADF [14.0].</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Resolve Bombardment.</p>

<h3 id="game-record-phase">Game Record Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Reset FWA Air Points counter to 0.
2) If last turn assess victory, otherwise advance Game Turn marker.</p>

<p>This is a clear FWA win.</p>

<h2 id="aar-for-first-game">AAR for first game</h2>

<p>First, the game is brilliant, no question, and no complaints.</p>

<p>However, I've played Silver Bayonet with a couple of fairly experienced
opponents as well as solo, and all three of us have had some trouble
with interpreting the Terrain Effects Chart. On the chart, column 6 is
titled "Attacker Combat Effects." Apparently, this column is referred to
as "Defender Combat Effects" in Section 4.2.1 of the rules (as shipped
and v1.1 pdf).</p>

<p>Question: what's the correct column title, "Attacker Combat Effects" or
"Defender Combat Effects?"</p>

<p>This point of confusion for us leads to the next question: is this
column (whatever it's titled) used for combat DRM, or is the TDV value
used for combat DRM? (FWIW, we have been using the TDV value.)</p>

<p>Apologies if this is explained in errata or elsewhere. I did some poking
around and wasn't able to find anything.</p>

<p>None.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Resolve Bombardment.</p>

<p>The VC have 2 bombardment points from a mortar unit. There do not appear
to be any DRM firing into the tea plantation, so the VC need a natural 1
roll to get a step loss, a 1 or 2 to get an <code>F</code>.</p>

<p>Mortar rolls 10 on Bombardment table, no effect.</p>

<h4 id="combat-coordination-phase-1">Combat Coordination Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Attack Coordination [7.0] which may negate declared Maneuver

<p>The VC are PAVN, and here operating outside the range of a HQ. The

<p>The roll is 7, so no coordination.</p>

<h4 id="assault-combat-phase-90-1">Assault Combat Phase [9.0]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Defender allocates and resolves air and/or artillery for Defensive

  <li>FWA rolls 7 for <code>2</code>, with TDV always 2 on defensive
bombardment, the VC take a step loss. (Again, same roll as first game.
Weird.)</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Defender rolls first on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and
applies results immediately.</p>

<p>FWA defending with 3, gets a - 1 DRM for attacker uncoordinated, roll 4 -
1 for an attacker step loss. (Different roll, same result as first
game.)</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Attacker rolls on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and results.</p>

<p>VC assaulting with 11, roll 9 + 1 (uncoordinated) - 1 (more than two
hexes attacking) for no effect.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">4) If units on both sides remain, both sides roll against highest ER in
their stack for Efficiency Check. A roll less than or equal to the ER
passes the Efficiency Check.</p>

<p>VC roll 3 for ER check on second round, FWA rolls 7, PAVN gets a second
assault round, FWA does not.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">5) Units passing their Efficiency Check may roll again on the Assault
Combat Table. This roll is simultaneous, results are not applied until
both sides (if possible) have rolled.</p>

<p>PAVN rolls 4 which is a step loss, almost surely have to take the step
as the artillery unit, need to read the rules on this. (12.4.4 HQs must
be the last steps chosen as combat losses.)</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">6) If Defender is eliminated, Assaulting units must advance.</p>

<p>Defender HQ still occupies tea plantation.</p>

<h3 id="fwa-player-turn-5">FWA Player Turn</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">FWA player's plans for this turn.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I'm inclined to go with having the FWA down to a single step be called a
draw. That seems to be a pretty likely case. In 6 games of this
scenario, the PAVN have only prevailed twice.</p>

<p>What follows is a first cut at some probabilistic modeling of the how
this scenario works. There is a lot more which could be done, and I have
a set of notes with more details.</p>

<h3 id="defensive-bombardment">Defensive Bombardment</h3>

<p>The scenario grants the FWA player 10 Air Points. A natural question to
ask is "How much damage can these 10 Air Points inflict?" The answer, of
course, is on the Bombardment/Support Table, column 10-14, we see
rolling 1 or 2 results in <code>4F</code>, which is 2 steps lost for TDV 2 (per
definition of TDV during Defensive Bombardment). On the other hand,
rolling an 8, 9 or 10 results in no step losses for the attacking PAVN.</p>

<p>The PAVN can reduce the odds one or two step losses by getting a hit and
damage on Air Defense Fire (ADF). Any damage at all shifts the FWA
bombardment to the 6-9 column. Let's calculate the probability of
PAVN inflicting damage on the defender's aircraft.</p>

<p>First, we note that rolling 1 or 2 results in a "hit," but since PAVN
has a mortar unit adjacent, PAVN gets a +1 DRM. Hence,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(H) = 0.3.</script>

<p>Given we have a hit,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(D) = 0.4.</script>

<p>Any damage at all results in a single column shift left. For Shift Left
<script type="math/tex">S_L</script>, we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(S_L) = P(H)P(D) = 0.12.</script>

<h3 id="probability-of-two-pavn-step-losses">Probability of two PAVN step losses</h3>

<p>Now let's check the probabilities on the Bombardment/Support Table. For
the 10-14 column <script type="math/tex">(B_{10})</script>, rolling 1 or 2 results in <code>4F</code>. On the 6-9 column
<script type="math/tex">(B_6)</script>,
rolling 1 results in <code>4F</code>. For some two step loss <script type="math/tex">L_2</script>,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
P(L_2 |B_6) & = (0.12)(0.1) = 0.012, \\
P(L_2 |B_{10}) & = (0.88)(0.2) = 0.176, \\
P(\neg{L_2} |B_{10}) & = (0.88)(0.8) = 0.704, \\
P(\neg{L_2}|B_6) & = (0.12)(0.9) = 0.108.
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Now we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(L_2) = P(L_2 |B_6) + P(L_2|B_{10}) = 0.012 + 0.176 = 0.188.</script>

<p>This result makes sense. If we were rolling only on the <script type="math/tex">B_{10}</script>
column it's easy to see there is a 20% chance of getting 2 step losses.
But the small probability of being hit with ADF weights the result into
the <script type="math/tex">B_6</script> column, just a small amount. So the odds are reduced just
over 1%, from 20% to 18.8%</p>

<h3 id="probability-of-single-pavn-step-loss">Probability of single PAVN step loss</h3>

<p>It's easy to compute the probability of losing exactly 1 step:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(L_1) = P(L_1 |B_6) + P(L_1|B_{10}) = (0.12)(0.5) + (0.88)(0.5) = 0.06 + 0.44 = 0.50.</script>

<p>Now that's an interesting result, and one which can be seen by
inspection!</p>

<h3 id="pavn-loses-at-least-1-step">PAVN loses at least 1 step</h3>

<p>To find the probability of losing <em>at least one step</em>, first
compute the probability of losing no steps <script type="math/tex">P(L_0)</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(L_0) = (0.12)(0.4) + (0.88)(0.3) = 0.048 + 0.264 = 0.312</script>

<p>Now,
<script type="math/tex">P(L_1) \cup P(L_2) = 1 - P(L_0) = 1 - 0.312 = 0.688.</script></p>

<p>In other words, there is about a 70% chance that Air Bombardment will
reduce PAVN by at least 1 step.</p>

<p>This study will be continued with an examination of the Assault Combat Table.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This concludes what I hope will be just the first round of
investigation.</p>

<p>I'm interested in digging deeper to
get a complete spectrum of outcomes, but that will take more time than
I'm willing to spend right now.</p>

<p>Next steps to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>See if this battle is amenable to some sort of spreadsheet system.</li>
  <li>Can it be programmed? Surely so.</li>
  <li>Continue on with Scenario #6b to give the PAVN another crack at it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fun times for the future!</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
