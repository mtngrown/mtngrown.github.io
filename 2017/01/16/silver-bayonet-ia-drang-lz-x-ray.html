Silver Bayonet: Ia Drang LZ X-Ray
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 16 2017</time>
<p>Another in-depth replay, this time with a bit more activity, movement
and combat spread over 2 turns. I've played this a couple of times
already, once solo and once opposed. Both games saw FWA wins.</p>

<p>For this game, I'm writing out the turn sequence in detail to follow the
action very closely. I'd like to see where the scenario balance (or
imbalance) is located.  I suspect it's very slightly tilted to the FWA,
off the top of my head, 60/40 FWA favor.</p>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1-november-3-1965">Turn 1 November 3, 1965</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Situation at the beginning of the turn.</p>

<p>We have A/1/9 and a CIDG unit lodged in LZ-XRay. The PAVN means to
dislodge them.</p>

<h3 id="initial-phase">Initial Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Adjust FWA Air Points [11.0]</p>

<p>0 for Turn 1.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Remove "First" and "Final" Fire markers for BOTH sides.</p>

<p>Nothing to remove.</p>

<h3 id="recovery-phase">Recovery Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Recover Fatigue [2.7.6].</p>

<p>Nothing to do.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Replace HQs [12.4.2].</p>

<p>Nothing to do.</p>

<h3 id="fwa-player-turn-1">FWA Player Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">First player's plans for this turn.</p>

<p>The FWA gets a free ambush on the PAVN unit in 1021, which concludes the
FWA turn.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-phase">Reinforcement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Place new units [15.2].</p>

<p>None this turn.</p>

<h4 id="movement-phase-40">Movement Phase [4.0]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Move ground units.</p>

<p>No FWA movement this turn, the night ambush is taken as a "move there
and back."</p>

<h4 id="combat-declaration-phase-61">Combat Declaration Phase [6.1]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Declare all assault and maneuver combat by placing markers.</p>

<p>Assault combat on PAVN in 1021.</p>

Bombardment [10.2]</p>

<p>None.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Defender rolls first on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and
applies results immediately.</p>

<p>None per scenarion guidelines.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Attacker rolls on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and results.</p>

<p>FWA gets a -2 DRM per scenario guidelines. Roll 4 - 2 for 2 which is
<code>1</code>, PAVN takes a step loss.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">4) If units on both sides remain, both sides roll against highest ER in
their stack for Efficiency Check. A roll less than or equal to the ER
passes the Efficiency Check.</p>

<p>Not used for initial FWA "night ambush."</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">5) Units passing their Efficiency Check may roll again on the Assault
Combat Table. This roll is simultaneous, results are not applied until
both sides (if possible) have rolled.</p>

<p>N/A</p>

<h4 id="combat-coordination-phase-3">Combat Coordination Phase</h4>

<h4 id="assault-combat-phase-90-3">Assault Combat Phase [9.0]</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Defender allocates and resolves air and/or artillery for Defensive
Bombardment [10.2]</p>

<p>FWA applies all 9 Air Points to defensive bombardment. ADF from PAVN
roll 1, roll 1 again(!) for <code>4*</code> damage on the Air Points. FWA rolls 7
on 3-5 column for <code>1</code>, which is no effect.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) Defender rolls first on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and
applies results immediately.</p>

<p>FWA rolls 10 with assault strength 3, no effect.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Attacker rolls on Assault Combat Table, applies DRMs and results.</p>

<p>PAVN assaults with 12, roll 1 - 1 (more than 2 hexes attacking) + 1
(Light Jungle Terrain Effect) net 1 for <code>2</code>, bad result for FWA!</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">4) If units on both sides remain, both sides roll against highest ER in
their stack for Efficiency Check. A roll less than or equal to the ER
passes the Efficiency Check.</p>

<p>Both fail EC.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">5) Units passing their Efficiency Check may roll again on the Assault
Combat Table. This roll is simultaneous, results are not applied until
both sides (if possible) have rolled.</p>

<p>No second round.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">6) If Defender is eliminated, Assaulting units must advance.</p>

<p>Defender still occupying PZ-XRay.</p>

<h3 id="game-record-phase-1">Game Record Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Reset FWA Air Points counter to 0.
2) If last turn assess victory, otherwise advance Game Turn marker.</p>

<p>FWA has lost 4 steps, PAVN 1 step.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FWA: 1 + 3 (LZ-XRay)</li>
  <li>PAVN: 4</li>
</ul>

<p>So it's a draw.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Can PAVN attempt combat refusal on the first turn in Scenario 3?</li>
  <li>Can Fatigue be applied to the same unit which takes a step loss?</li>
</ol>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
