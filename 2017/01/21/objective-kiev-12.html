Objective Kiev 12
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 21 2017</time>
<p>I'm not going to use Roman numerals any longer, it's too difficult to
read (for me) and feels affected. Arabic has the benefit of being simple
to read and understand.</p>

<p>This game of Objective Kiev will sit on my H-index of 12, being one of
three plays I need to achieve H-index 12.</p>

<p>My goal for this game is to figure out how to win as the Russians. It
took me 9 games to figure out the Germans, and now I don't see how the
Germans can lose. Hence, I must not be playing the Russians correctly.</p>

<p>This game's strategy is to deploy three Soviet armies on the Polish
border, and one on the Romanian border, to attempt to protect the
eastern edge of the map for bringing in replacements and reinforcements.
My hunch is that if the Soviets can hold on long enough to bring in the
reinforcements starting on Turn 5, they can probably win the game.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Here's the set up with three armies forward:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g12-setup.jpg" alt="Objective Kiev Game 12 set up" /></p>

<p>The Germans kick everything off in their Combat phase. The attacks
proceed in the following order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>14 Pz in 0402 against 22 Mech in 0503, odds 6:1, 14 Pz advances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 Pz (0203) and 4 IC (0303) against untried Mech in 0304. Odds 6:1, 3
Pz advances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>48 Pz (0303) and 17 IC (0402) against 40 Army (0403). This combat is
last to exploit a step loss on retreat, given the Germans succeed with
the flanking Mech attacks. Odds 2:1 + 1R for 3:1 roll 6 for <code>DRL</code>, which
eliminates 40 Army as it takes a second step loss retreating through
EZOCs established by 3 and 14 Pz. 48 Pz advances.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also, 16 Mech (shown on in its untried side is eliminated from 0205 and
11 IC advances.</p>

<p>Here's the situation before the combat:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g12-t1-german-combat.jpg" alt="Initial German attack up
close" /></p>

<p>If you set this up and play it out, you will see that the Germans just
blew a 3 hex wide hole in the Soviet line.</p>

<p>This is about the worst possible scenario for the Soviets, so let's see
if it can be salvaged.</p>

<p>The Soviets bring up a bunch of Mech units and an Army, while moving
other armies east along rails as best as possible. One combat with
doubled Mech AF sends 14 Pz into retreat through Soviet EZOC, costing it
a step it won't get back for a couple more turns. If the Soviets can
knock another step off the German armor, they may be able to cut one of
them off from communication from the western edge. That would be very
good.</p>

<p>For their movement phase, the Soviets get most of their units about to
the middle of the map, establishing ZOC control across the map. The
Germans will be able to break this easily, but they will have to stop
and break it. The Soviets have good defense in depth in the south, but
not in the north.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>The Germans now have to get through the admittedly weak Soviet defensive
to establish control of eastern communication. It should not be too
difficult in the north, and the Germans should be in control of Kiev at
the end of their armor and reserve movement segment. The situation in
the south looks a lot more difficult to handle. In previous games, the
Soviets have left the south too open, allowing the Axis infantry units
easy access to eastern communication.</p>

<p>Here's the situation at the start of Turn 2:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g12-t2-start.jpg" alt="Game 12 Turn 2 start" /></p>

<p>The Germans get all three armor units into or past Kiev, not a surprise.</p>

<p>But now the Soviets can bring in two half-strength armies for
replacements, and these units are coming in at Uman and Vinnitsa.
Soviet attacks manage an <code>AL</code> and a <code>DR</code>, not great, but not too bad
consider the low odds which the Soviets have to attack at.
Significantly, the Soviets finish the turn with a line west of Kiev
cutting off communication with the western edge. This was one of the
goals of the game, and it's nice to see it achieved early.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>The German player who isn't watching the German line of commication back
west is going to be in trouble in the east when it comes time to acquire
replacements. Sadly for the Germans, they are in a bind, as they do not
have enough units far enough forward to lock down the eastern edge this
turn. They can get the northern 3/4, but without those infantry units in
the south, the Soviets will pump in replacements every turn.</p>

<p>Here's the situation at the start of Turn 3:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g12-t3-start.jpg" alt="Game 12 Turn 3 start" /></p>

<p>The German plan for Turn 3 is to seal off the northern half of the
eastern edge, get the line of communication protected from further
Soviet disruption, and get the infantry moving forward again.</p>

<p>The Soviets need to reestablish a line to cut off communication, and
keep the eastern edge open. If they can do that, it shoudn't be problem
to get at least a draw.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>The Germans are not in great shape, but should be able to pull off a
win, perhaps with some low odds attacks as necessary.</p>

<p>The Soviets were able to keep the Germans cut off, so no replacements
for the Pz corps. That's going to put a serious crimp in the German's style.</p>

<p>If the Soviets can get through this turn while maintaining communication
for replacements, I think it will go to at least a draw.</p>

<p>Here's the situation at the start of Turn 4:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g12-t4-start.jpg" alt="Game 12 Turn 4 start" /></p>

<p>Tough sledding for both sides.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>Looks like it's going to come down a couple of die rolls on German
attacks at 1-1 or 2-1 odds.</p>

<p>If the Germans can advance just a hex to put the edge into EZOC, that
prevents the reinforcement from coming in.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g12-t5-start.jpg" alt="Game 12 Turn 5 start" /></p>

<p>The turn went well for the Germans.</p>

<p>Soviets are in deep trouble now. However, on a 1-1 attack, they managed
to eliminate 14 Pz. It just won't be enough. However, they're doing
better than in the last few games, and have a good shot at having units
on the map at the end of the game.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>The Germans need to completely eliminate the Soviets, or at least
eliminate the units along the eastern edge.</p>

<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g12-t6-start.jpg" alt="Game 12 Turn 6 start" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p>This is the end of the game for sure. The Germans will be able to kick
the Soviets out of Kirovograd, and the Soviets will not have enough
combat factors to retake it afterwards.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g12-t7-start.jpg" alt="Game 12 Turn 7 start" /></p>

<p>Looks like another victory for the Germans.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Here's what the end of the game looked like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-kiev/g12-end.jpg" alt="Game 12 end" /></p>

<p>The Soviets made a huge blunder: the remaining mech unit should have at
least attempted to dislodge one of the infantry units on the northern
end of of the east edge. With a little bit of luck, they may have been
able to thin the Germans a little bit more, and been able to bring in
the reinforcements. Something to explore on the next play!</p>

<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>

<p>These notes need to go into a strategy article, which has a strategy
tag to make it easy to find. This might be worthy of its own page:
strategy/objective-kiev.html</p>

<p>For the Germans, get the Soviet mech units off the board as fast as
conveniently possible as they can only come back as replacements 1 per
turn. These mech units exert a zone of control, and used properly, will
slow down the German advance.</p>

<p>Germans want to get past the Soviet armies and to the east edge to cut
off communication, without eliminating them until the east edge is
secure. This reduces the number of armies the Soviets can bring in as
replacements.</p>

<p>The Soviets need to balance slowing down the German advance to the east
edge, with preserving enough strength to keep the east edge open for
replacements and reinforcements.</p>

<p>There are two ways for the Soviets to set up on the Polish border: 1.
three armies, and 2. four armies.</p>

<p>It's not clear at the moment which is the better strategy.</p>

<p>Four armies forward would seem better to slow German advance, but the
set up restriction of no adjacent armies puts the four army
configuration in a peculiar vulnerability to fast German penetration of
the line. The Germans can punch through mech units without the 1L river
shift, forcing a retreat through zocs for the army in the middle. On the
other hand, having an army eliminated and ready to return into Kiev as
replacement is handy.</p>

<p>With the three army configuration, the Soviets get a running start to
the east. I'm not sure how much this will matter yet because I haven't
played that strategy.</p>

<p>A good German player is going to ignore Kiev in favor of cutting off
communication. If the Germans can be baited into wasting energy on Kiev
early in the game, it may be possible for the Soviets to establish a
stout line defending a section of the eastern edge, necessary for
replacements.</p>

<p>One mistake I've consistently made as the Soviet player is only bringing
in replacements from the eastern edge, instead of placing them in a
convenient, Soviet controlled city. This is bound to make a difference,
as it allows the Soviets more flexibility to provide defense in depth on
the turn of entry, rather than waiting for the next turn after the
replacements move west. The "next turn" might be too late.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
