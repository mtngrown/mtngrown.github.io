Silver Bayonet Scenario 1 (w/ Objective 218 and Zombie Dice)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 22 2017</time>

<p>This scenario is an ARVN vs. PAVN scenario, which according to the set
up card took place just before the events of Long Reach and Silver
Bayonet proper.</p>

<p>If our game is any indication, the ARVN got hammered.</p>

<p>I played ARVN in this game, AS played the PAVN. Final score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PAVN: 17</li>
  <li>ARVN: 8</li>
</ul>

<p>We did mess a few rolls and a couple of combat sequences, which actually
did matter a little bit, but I don't think it mattered a lot. PAVN did
get very lucky on ADF rolls, which are very probability to induce actual
damage.</p>

<p>Here's the end of Turn 4, after everyone has all their reinforcements:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/silver-bayonet/g14-t4.jpg" alt="Silver Bayonet Game 14, Scenario 1, Turn
4" /></p>

<p>I do have a few questions which came up in this game:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If CIDG is stacked with another unit, can it operate the Combat
Refusal given it has the highest ER? We played that the other unit
negated the Combat Refusal, but it's not completely clear in the rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the use of the ARVN APC which is marked "HQ?"</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is only one fatigued step remaining in a hex, and the result
of the maneuver combat is <code>BF</code>, is that last step eliminated? We
played that it does get eliminated.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="objective-218">Objective 218</h2>

<p>Next we played a couple of games of Objective 218, a small Ogre-themed
card game. I played Combine (white) in both games, and won both games
with Command Post occupation. I think I got a little bit lucky in both
games.</p>

<p>Here's the end of the first game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-218/g9.jpg" alt="Objective 218 Game 9 end" /></p>

<p>And here's the end of the second game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-218/g10.jpg" alt="Objective 218 Game 10 end" /></p>

<p>One correlation between the games is having the diagonal targeting of
the Ogre in the first game and missile tank in the second game.
Something to think about for future games.</p>

<h2 id="zombie-dice">Zombie Dice</h2>

<p>We finished off with the customary game of Zombie Dice, using the School
Bus expansion. As usual, lots of laughs. I lost by 1, final scores AS 14
me 13.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
