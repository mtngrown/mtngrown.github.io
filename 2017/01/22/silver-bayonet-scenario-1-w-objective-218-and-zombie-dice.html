<p>This scenario is an ARVN vs. PAVN scenario, which according to the set
up card took place just before the events of Long Reach and Silver
Bayonet proper.</p>

<p>If our game is any indication, the ARVN got hammered.</p>

<p>I played ARVN in this game, AS played the PAVN. Final score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PAVN: 17</li>
  <li>ARVN: 8</li>
</ul>

<p>We did mess a few rolls and a couple of combat sequences, which actually
did matter a little bit, but I don't think it mattered a lot. PAVN did
get very lucky on ADF rolls, which are very probability to induce actual
damage.</p>

<p>Here's the end of Turn 4, after everyone has all their reinforcements:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/silver-bayonet/g14-t4.jpg" alt="Silver Bayonet Game 14, Scenario 1, Turn
4" /></p>

<p>I do have a few questions which came up in this game:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If CIDG is stacked with another unit, can it operate the Combat
Refusal given it has the highest ER? We played that the other unit
negated the Combat Refusal, but it's not completely clear in the rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the use of the ARVN APC which is marked "HQ?"</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is only one fatigued step remaining in a hex, and the result
of the maneuver combat is <code>BF</code>, is that last step eliminated? We
played that it does get eliminated.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="objective-218">Objective 218</h2>

<p>Next we played a couple of games of Objective 218, a small Ogre-themed
card game. I played Combine (white) in both games, and won both games
with Command Post occupation. I think I got a little bit lucky in both
games.</p>

<p>Here's the end of the first game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-218/g9.jpg" alt="Objective 218 Game 9 end" /></p>

<p>And here's the end of the second game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/objective-218/g10.jpg" alt="Objective 218 Game 10 end" /></p>

<p>One correlation between the games is having the diagonal targeting of
the Ogre in the first game and missile tank in the second game.
Something to think about for future games.</p>

<h2 id="zombie-dice">Zombie Dice</h2>

<p>We finished off with the customary game of Zombie Dice, using the School
Bus expansion. As usual, lots of laughs. I lost by 1, final scores AS 14
me 13.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
