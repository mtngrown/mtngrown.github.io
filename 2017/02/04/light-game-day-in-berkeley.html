Light game day in Berkeley
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb  4 2017</time>
<p>CC and SK had already started when I arrived, they were finishing up a
game of classic Ogre. Once that was out of the way, we played a game of
6 Nimmt, which I managed to lose in a manner most spectacular.</p>

<p>SK had to leave at this point, so CC and I continued with a game of
Zeppelin Attack.</p>

<p>Pandemic was up next. We played Virulent Strain with 4 Epidemics. The
action of the epidemic we exposed first incurred an extra infection card
any time the most prevalent disease was drawn. In this case it was red.
CC played the Firefighter role, I played Archivist, and the third player
which we both shared play on was the Epidemiologist. We beat the 4
epidemics with a healthy buffer of city cards remainining.</p>

<p>We took a break with Zombie Dice, Big Summer Action Movie. Once again, I
lose. I'm having a bad run of luck with this game. By bad luck, I mean I
don't even get a chance to "push my luck," as my first rolls seem to
come up all blasts, no brains. Good thing I'm not a gambling man.</p>

<p>Red Dragon Inn, a very light game which we thought would be pretty good
with 3-4 people. The 2 person play is a bit too mechanical, it really
does need more people to get the interaction going well.</p>

<p>Star Realms. Taught CC how to play. This game was odd as the Trade Row
started out with mostly 6-8 cost cards. It was difficult to get started.
I lost this one, but I think just barely. CC went big with Blob, and as
it turned out, a large number of Blob cards came through the Trade Row.
My Trade Federation faction was pretty scarce.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
