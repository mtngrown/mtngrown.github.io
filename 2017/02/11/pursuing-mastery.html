                Pursuing mastery
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 11 2017</time>
              <p>I have a bunch of games. Mostly wargames. More than I'm going list. I
              understand this is not an uncommon problem; I've been here before with
              more books than I'm likely capable of reading in my remaining lifetime.
              At least, reading with any depth of understanding with respect to my
              collection of mathematics books.</p>
              
              <p>This surfeit of games (and books) should not distract me from pursuing
              mastery in some subset of the games (and books) I own.  Achieving
              mastery in either, or anything, requires discipline and focus, and some
              vision of the end goal.</p>
              
              <p>My current vision is to simply get better at playing a selected number
              of games, where "better" means not just winning, but being highly
              conversant with the rules, and not suffering any analysis paralysis
              during game play.</p>
              
              <h2 id="games">Games</h2>
              
              <p>In my opinion, the best way to get good at playing is to play. Since
              it's not possible to play All The Games, it's necessary to choose one
              or more games for repeated play. Since I get bored playing the same game
              over and over, I've chosen a small selection of games which have high
              repeat play potential.</p>
              
              <h3 id="ocs-system">OCS system</h3>
              
              <p>I'm lumping all OCS games together as the time commitment for any one of
              them is extreme compared to most of the other games I own, but the
              playing skills are portable across all the games in the system. Getting
              better at playing one OCS title will increase the enjoyment for any other OCS
              title.</p>
              
              <p>So far I've played scenarios from Tunisia, Baltic Gap, DAK and Case
              Blue. I really like this system.</p>
              
              <h3 id="france-40">France '40</h3>
              
              <p>I <em>really</em> like Mark Simonitch's <em>France '40</em>.</p>
              
              <p>So far I've played the full <em>France '40</em> game four times and <em>Ukraine '43</em> twice.</p>
              
              <p>For France '40, I've started developing smaller scenarios exploring
              situations in the first few turns, in small sections of the map.</p>
              
              <h3 id="chadwicks-eastern-front-games">Chadwick's Eastern Front games</h3>
              
              <p>I'm lumping <em>Battle for Moscow</em>, <em>Target Leningrad</em>, <em>Objective Kiev</em>
              and <em>The Arduous Beginning</em> into the same slot as these four games are
              very similer in most respects. They play quickly on small maps with few
              units, no or low stacking, and concise rules, which are very similar
              between all the games. They are packed in small zip lock bags which take
              up very little space no matter stored. They aren't the easiest to teach,
              but they do solo well enough to learn winning strategies for either
              side.</p>
              
              <p>At the moment, I've played Battle for Moscow 12 times, Objective Kiev 12
              times, and Target Leningrad 12 times. I've purchased <em>The Arduous Beginning</em>
              but haven't yet played it.</p>
              
              <p>I can see myself playing any of these games many, many times. In fact,
              I've played Battle for Moscow in parallel with Fire in the Lake.</p>
              
              <h3 id="panzerblitz">PanzerBlitz</h3>
              
              <p>I'll probably lose 90% of my readers right here, but that's fine. I like
              PanzerBlitz quite a bit. It's not a difficult game to learn or teach,
              and it plays pretty fast. And I have some backstory with the game.</p>
              
              <p>As it turns out, I acquired my first copy of PanzerBlitz in 1972. I must
              have been 11 years old at the time. I did not find any one else willing
              to play it, and I was just a little too young to work through it on my
              own. After some moves around the country, a couple of years with early
              RPGs, my interest in playing games evaporated in favor of extreme
              (outdoor) sports, which wasn't really a thing back then.</p>
              
              <p>Fast forward to my current advancing decrepitude, a career in software
              application development, running across the mongo OGRE/GEV
              Kickstarter, and my interest in playing games in general was reawakened,
              with a specific interest in wargames. What would be more natural than
              picking up a used copy of PanzerBlitz on eBay for $30? Nothing, that's
              what.</p>
              
              <p>At the time of writing, I've got 27 plays of PanzerBlitz. About 2/3 are
              solo plays. I've all 12 scenarios in the box at least once, with the
              rules as written. I've play 10 of the scenarios solo, most of them
              twice, the first time to get a feel for the scenario, the second time
              "playing for keeps."</p>
              
              <p>I'd like to eventually finish out all the classic scenarios with two
              solo games each, then work through each of these scenarios opposed
              taking each side once.</p>
              
              <p>I have also played Situation #3 using Alan Arvold's alternate OOB, and
              it is outstanding, even with the rules as written. I suspect most of the
              other scenarios could be slightly modified for large improvement.</p>
              
              <p>Regarding "panzerbush:" I will only say that I served in the USMC in 2d
              Recon Battalion, which earned me professional experience in identifying
              enemy units at distance. I don't have any issue with "panzerbush."</p>
              
              <h3 id="ogregev">Ogre/GEV</h3>
              
              <p>Of the remaining 10%, I'll probably lose another 90% of readers with
              this.</p>
              
              <p>But Ogre really got me into wargaming in a big way.</p>
              
              <p>It probably helps a lot that there is a dedicated group of local
              players, and we have support from the FLGS to set up our giant Ogre
              games at the store every couple of months. It's kind of big deal, as it
              really does take up a lot of table space, which the store could possibly
              dedicate to more popular games. But so far it's worked out really well.</p>
              
              <p>So, why? Why do I like Ogre when I also like "real" wargames such as
              France '40 and Tunisia. Well, sometimes I just want to blow stuff up,
              and Ogre has free bullets. It's not hard to do or understand.</p>
              
              <p>At the time of writing, I have 34 plays of Ogre/GEV. I've played most of
              the scenarios in the ODE scenario booklet, many of them as attacker and
              defender. I've also played a number of the third party scenarios (e.g.,
              Operation Newspaper, etc.), scenarios associated with the Kickstarter
              sponsored counter sheets (e.g., Barbarians at the Gate), and a few of the
              lastest scenarios resulting from a scenario contest.</p>
              
              <p>I don't have any specific goals with respect to Ogre/GEV. As long as I
              can find a fun group of folks who like blowing stuff up, I'm in to play
              pretty much any scenario, as either attacker or defender. At some point,
              I'll probably start tracking which scenarios I've played and have yet to
              play, which will provide excellent motivation to play a lot more Ogre.</p>
              
              <h3 id="fire-in-the-lake--coin">Fire in the Lake &amp; COIN</h3>
              
              <p>While I intend on eventually playing through all the COIN games, I have
              an intellectual interest in Vietnam, being of an age where worry of the
              draft was a real thing.</p>
              
              <p>One thing I really enjoy about Fire in the Lake is the event cards,
              many of which describe events for which I have entire games covering
              just that event. For example, SEALORDS, or the Tet Offensive.</p>
              
              <p>So far I've logged 8 plays of <em>Fire in the Lake</em> with about half of them
              solo. I usually play the NVA when playing opposed. Solo plays range from
              working through the long game, to hours-long, in-depth studies of a few
              turns using the bots.</p>
              
              <h3 id="starforce">StarForce</h3>
              
              <p>StarForce is a brilliant little game featuring pseudo-3D map with
              simultaneous movement. Counter density if very low, typically 6-8
              counters per faction which considerably reduces the overhead for
              simultaneous movement.</p>
              
              <h3 id="pandemicflash-point">Pandemic/Flash Point</h3>
              
              <p>I'm lumping these together because they aren't wargames, they play
              quickly, and they are amenable to solo play. I treat them both as
              puzzles. Both have a number of expansions to increase difficulty and
              provide a variety of new experiences. I'd like to play each enough to
              more or less figure them out. I don't have any idea how many games that
              will take. At my current learning speed, probably 6-8+ for Pandemic, 8-10
              for Flash Point with standard rules, as I've figured out the Basic rules
              already.</p>
              
              <p>Once I feel comfortable with the game in the box, it will be time to add
              the expansions in.</p>
              
              <h2 id="is-this-too-much-like-work">Is this too much like work?</h2>
              
              <p>Doing anything with an end goal in mind can quickly devolve into work,
              AKA, "no fun."</p>
              
              <p>I'm keeping the fun quotient high by limiting playing time to when I
              actually have time to play, without feeling forced to play. In other
              words, for when I have time to have fun.</p>
              
              <p>With solo games, this is easier with "euro" style titles such as
              Pandemic and Flash Point. It's not difficult to knock a couple of games
              or more in a session. With wargames it's a bit harder. I go through
              phases where I have no interest in soloing wargames, which means I have
              to find opponents which are interested in the same games I want to play.</p>
              
              <h3 id="motivational-milestones">Motivational milestones.</h3>
              
              <p>I track several motivational milestones:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Nickels, 5 plays of  game. I've found if a game is worth playing
              twice, it's often worth playing 5 times. One website I intermittently
              visit lists 5 plays as a "nickel."</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Dimes, 10 plays of a game. A game worth playing 5 times might be
              worth playing 10 times. Not all the games I've played 5 times are
              worth another 10 plays, but some of them are.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>H-Index, the number of games played a certain number of times. For
              example, my current at-this-time-of-writing H-Index of 11 means I've
              played 11 titles 11 times. Building an H-Index provides motivation to play
              the same game a number of times, often in rapid succession. It also
              provides motivation to return to previously played games.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Average plays of owned games. Keeping this number fairly high is a
              great way to ensure one gets plenty of experience. For example, at the
              moment, I have 67 listed games with 415 recorded plays for an average
              of 6.19 plays per game. While the number 231 also accounts for plays
              of games I don't own (e.g., Settlers of Catan), I usually play games I
              do own, so the average is a good estimate in any case.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Systematic scenario playthroughs. Many games have a single, main
              scenario which defines the game and how it's played. This main scenario
              may be accompanied by one or a small number of related scenarios which
              start or finish the play at different points of the main scenarios.
              Finally, a significant number of wargames have many scenarios of various
              types. Playing through all the scenarios for each game, once per side or
              faction, is really helpful for developing mastery.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Session reports, writing up each game during play or after playing.
              When I'm soloing, session reports tend to be very detailed as I work
              my way through the rules, paying very close attention to the turn
              sequence. When I'm playing opposed, I typically jot down a few notes
              during the game play, then include these notes in a brief post
              recording the game.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>For me, each of these motivational milestones helps provides focus.
              Typically, for each play after the first few, I have a particular
              problem I wish to investigate, and I may or may not be concerned with
              winning any particular play.</p>
              
              <h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here?</h2>
              
              <p>The road ahead is amazing. There are now dozens of excellent games being
              released each year, far more than anyone could ever play, much less
              master. A few which I find interesting include the following:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>East Front Series. Much of this system, which focuses on 1941-1942 is
              now out of print. However, I do have a couple, and the game play looks
              fascinating. The scale is division/regimental level, so each game
              in the series contains at least 1000 counters and multiple maps.
              This is a long term project to be sure.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Empire of the Sun. I have a copy of the second edition, but haven't
              yet set it up. It's not the easiest to game from what I've read, and
              I'm anticipating wanting to play it several times in rapid succession
              to get a grip on the rules.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Vietnam 1965-1975. I'm not sure "mastery" is an appropriate
              goal, having played a couple of short scenarios. I would, however,
              like to play the campaign game at least one time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Vintage games of one sort or another. Two I really like are <em>Year of
              the Rat</em> and <em>Winter War</em>, both dating from the early 1970s. Both play
              fairly quickly, are not overly complicated, yet each have enough twist
              to remain interesting for a few games. <em>Winter War</em> in particular has a
              number of variations for the Finnish player to explore.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Fortunately for my wallet, my main interest is in 20th century conflict,
              mostly WWII and modern. Other eras, such as Napoleanic or American Civil
              War, have a vast panoply of games, but I am not at all tempted to
              purchase any of them.</p>
              
              <h2 id="its-not-only-about-mastery">It's not only about mastery</h2>
              
              <p>Mastery is as much about the journey as the end goal. The real benefit
              of pursuing mastery with a selected number of games is the fun of
              playing something I already know the rules for. Learning a new game can
              be hard work, and usually very time consuming. Choosing to play anything
              on my mastery list means <em>not</em> having to learn a new set of rules. It's
              much easier to just enjoy the game.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
