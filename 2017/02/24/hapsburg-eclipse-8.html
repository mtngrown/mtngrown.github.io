                Hapsburg Eclipse 8
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 24 2017</time>
              <p>Hapsburg Eclipse is on my Dime list for 2017. I don't think I've beaten
              it fairly yet, so it's about time I do. It seems I usually get about 17
              cards in and lose ("Crushing Defeat"). Let's try and do better than 17
              cards on this play.</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li><code>03</code> Battle of Cer. Croat advances, Carpathian offensive succeeds.</li>
                <li><code>15</code> Treaty of London. Nice! Second card and the war marker gets
              moved. This might be a good thing. Carpathian offensive succeeds,
              purchase resource with 2 remaining actions.</li>
                <li><code>07</code> Drina Campaign. Victory. Polish and Italian offensives succeed.</li>
                <li><code>24</code> Danube Flotilla Sails. Italians stay in Undine. Purchase +1 DRM
              with 2 actions.</li>
                <li><code>21</code> Brusilov Offensive. Carpathian advances to Premsyl, unable
              offensives fail, but still acquire Russia Tires as a Victory. NW 0,
              not doing too bad getting started.</li>
                <li><code>10</code> German 9th Army. Carpathian and Polish offensives succeed.</li>
                <li><code>33</code> Battle of Passchendaele. Defeat.</li>
                <li><code>02</code> Drive into Galacia. Czech moved back to Loyal.</li>
                <li><code>34</code> Hungarian Food Shortages.</li>
                <li><code>35</code> German Aid. Only 1 action for this card, Polish offensive fails.
              NW -4, not looking real great here.</li>
                <li><code>12</code> Battle of Dogger Bank. Victory. Polish offensive succeeds with
              German Aid.</li>
                <li><code>20</code> Strafexpedition. All offensives fail, all revolts advance.
              Premzyl reduced to 2. Bummer of a turn.</li>
                <li><code>11</code> Putnik Reclaims Belgrade. Stalemate. Both offensives against
              Carpathian fail.</li>
                <li><code>30</code> Nivelle Offensive. Defeat. NW -5.</li>
                <li><code>16</code> Mackensen Takes Command. About time, this may be the only thing
              which keeps me in the game another turn. Carpathian offensive succeeds,
              but only one of them.</li>
                <li><code>26</code> Fighting in the Trentino. Victory. Croat in revolt, revolt
              suppressed. Two more turns and I think I've beat my average.</li>
                <li><code>14</code> Gallipoli Campaign. Victory. Spend 2 action to rebuild Przemysl.
               NW -1.</li>
                <li><code>17</code> Bulgaria Joins the War. Was not able to place the Bulgarian
              Trench Line as Polish Front was on the 1 space. Bummer. NW -1. I've
              probably beat my average this 18th turn.</li>
                <li><code>19</code> Battle of Ctesiphon. Defeat. NW -4.</li>
                <li><code>29</code> Ontranto Barrage. Defeat. Balkan now advancing. More bummer.
              But Carpathian pushed back another space, so regain a Strategic Site.
              NW -4. This was Turn 20. Wonder if I can make it to Turn 25?</li>
                <li><code>27</code> Provisional Gov. Takes Charge. This is a huge card, it flips
              Polish and Carpathian Fronts to their weaker sides and retreats them one
              space. Now if I could just get these two fronts off the map… Balkan
              offensive succeeds.</li>
                <li><code>04</code> Battle of Mons. Victory! Polish and Carpathian offensives
              succeed. NW -1. Now if only I could get Radio Intercepts…</li>
                <li><code>13</code> Czechoslovak Legion. Czechs revolt, crushed. Polish offensive
              fails.</li>
                <li><code>06</code> Radio Intercepts. Finally. Croat revolt, crushed. Balkan
              offensive succeeds. NW -4.</li>
                <li><code>25</code> Death of Franz Josef. Hungarian revolt, crushed. Carpathian
              offensive fails.</li>
                <li><code>18</code> Von Lettow-Vorbeck. Victory. Balkan on Space 1, canceled by
              Radio Intercept. Czech in revolt. Carpathian advance also canceled
              via RI. This would have been the game with Radio Intercepts. Balkan
              offensive succeeds. Polish offensive succeeds. NW -5. Ruh roh.</li>
                <li><code>22</code> Romania Joins Allies. War marker moved, we're into the last deck
              now, first time since I can remember that happening. Romanian offensive
              succeeds. Carpathian offensive succeeds. Balkan offensive succeeds. Very
              lucky this turn, it really could have been the last turn.</li>
                <li><code>32</code> Corfu Declaration. Balkan Front flips to 3. Bummer. NW -5. Big
              Bummer. But I'm doing pretty well otherwise, all the way to 28 cards.</li>
                <li><code>45</code> War Weariness. This looks like the end of the line, with all
              nationalities getting triggered and no Actions allowed. Carpathian
              advances to Budapest, Romanian to Bucharest for a net 3 Strategic Sites
              lost. Hungary goes into revolt for another hit. NW -8, game over.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>I just found out I've been playing it wrong. The Premzyl flags don't
              count until the fort is destroyed. That definitely changes the game.</p>
              
              <p>I have also not been tracking Stalemates, I've been counting these as
              defeats.</p>
              
              <p>Not too bad, got to 29 cards this game.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
