LZ Albany set up and first turns
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 26 2017</time>
<p>I have a game of LZ Albany scheduled tomorrow at EGO with AS, my usual
Vietnam opponent. I thought I'd take a few hours this evening to set it
up and walk through a couple of turns, just to see how it plays. This
will be very helpful tomorrow, saving us a lot of time.</p>

<p>The game comes with Modern War issue #24. It was designed by John
Poniske, a designer of some repute in the community.</p>

<p>The map is area movement, which makes sense at this scale, for this
situation. The firefight resulted from a successful PAVN ambush the day
following the tremendous battle at LZ X-Ray, a couple of miles away.</p>

<p>Set up isn't difficult, however, the counters for both sides look very
similar. I'm going to assume that's part of the plan to stymie each
side's ability to coordinate fire, there friendly fire casualties on
both sides.</p>

<p>The game lasts 10 turns, with the last 2 turns being night turns.</p>

<p>Let's take it for a spin.</p>

<p>But first, the Turn Sequence:</p>

<h2 id="turn">Turn</h2>

<h3 id="reinforcement-phase">1. Reinforcement Phase</h3>

<h3 id="event-phase">2. Event Phase</h3>

<h3 id="action-phase">3. Action Phase</h3>

<h3 id="rally-phase">4. Rally Phase</h3>

<h3 id="administrative-phase">5. Administrative Phase</h3>

<p>Now, we can play.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Note, because ambush, the US player is severely limited on Turn 1.</p>

<h3 id="reinforcement-phase-1">1. Reinforcement Phase</h3>

<p>Nothing yet, everyone is on the map from set up.</p>

<h3 id="event-phase-1">2. Event Phase</h3>

<p>US doesn't get this due to ambush. The PAVN rolls 4 and places No
Move/Fire on A/2/7.</p>

<h3 id="action-phase-1">3. Action Phase</h3>

<p>Since only PAVN had action chits, they're the only ones going to take
the initiative Turn 1.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>PAVN 1/33 activates Move, moves into regions with A/2-7 to initiate
Melee. Results, 1 hit on each side. No officer casualties. US
prevails here.  Another PAVN 1/33 moves into adjacent to melee with part of C/2-7</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>8/8 moves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7/8 moves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6/8 moves.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rally-phase-1">4. Rally Phase</h3>

<p>Both PAVN and US can rally one unit because of colocated Officers.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-phase-1">5. Administrative Phase</h3>

<p>VP calculation: 11 PAVN, 10 US.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Last turn was pretty bloody for both sides. This turn probably just as
much.</p>

<h3 id="reinforcement-phase-2">1. Reinforcement Phase</h3>

<p>Mostly US reinforcements, and a bunch of them.</p>

<h3 id="event-phase-2">2. Event Phase</h3>

<p>US roll 3, move B/2-7 towards LZ.</p>

<p>PAVN roll 3, move part of 8/8 in between B/2-7 and LZ.</p>

<h3 id="action-phase-2">3. Action Phase</h3>

<ol>
  <li>US: B/2-7 does ranged fire on PAVN in space between them and LZ.</li>
  <li>US: D/2-7 moves north.</li>
  <li>PAVN: ranged fire from 8/8 on B/2-7.</li>
  <li>US: A/2-7 moves north.</li>
  <li>PAVN: 6/8 moves west to melee C/2-7. C/2-7 retreats after first
round.</li>
  <li>PAVN: Adrenaline.</li>
  <li>PAVN: Move 10/8 2 spaces west.</li>
  <li>US: B/2-7 fires into 8/8, scores 4 hits, takes no hits in return.</li>
  <li>PAVN: 10/8 moves into LZ Albany.</li>
  <li>PAVN: 1/33 fires onto D/2-7, scores 2, loses 1.</li>
  <li>PAVN: 1/33 does it again, scores another hit, takes none.</li>
  <li>US: Artillery, scores 2 total hits on 8/8.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rally-phase-2">4. Rally Phase</h3>

<p>PAVN not lucky on rally rolls.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-phase-2">5. Administrative Phase</h3>

<p>Clean up.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>From just this small amount of playing, I can see that ranged fire is
useful for wearing down units in advance of an assault, i.e., melee.</p>

<p>I don't understand the rule for fire on ovestacking. The example implies
that 6 platoons (US) would induce a "No Fire" situation on the that
region. Which doesn't make sense. It would make sense to switch a die
for each extra unit to friendly fire, but not to reduce the units
firing. I had understood the PAVN units were companies, something I
should double check.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
