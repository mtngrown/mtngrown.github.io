LZ Albany set up and first turns
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 26 2017</time>
<p>I have a game of LZ Albany scheduled tomorrow at EGO with AS, my usual
Vietnam opponent. I thought I'd take a few hours this evening to set it
up and walk through a couple of turns, just to see how it plays. This
will be very helpful tomorrow, saving us a lot of time.</p>

<p>The game comes with Modern War issue #24. It was designed by John
Poniske, a designer of some repute in the community.</p>

<p>The map is area movement, which makes sense at this scale, for this
situation. The firefight resulted from a successful PAVN ambush the day
following the tremendous battle at LZ X-Ray, a couple of miles away.</p>

<p>Set up isn't difficult, however, the counters for both sides look very
similar. I'm going to assume that's part of the plan to stymie each
side's ability to coordinate fire, there friendly fire casualties on
both sides.</p>

<p>The game lasts 10 turns, with the last 2 turns being night turns.</p>

<p>Let's take it for a spin.</p>

<p>But first, the Turn Sequence:</p>

<h2 id="turn">Turn</h2>

<h3 id="reinforcement-phase">1. Reinforcement Phase</h3>

<h3 id="event-phase">2. Event Phase</h3>

<h3 id="action-phase">3. Action Phase</h3>

<h3 id="rally-phase">4. Rally Phase</h3>

<h3 id="administrative-phase">5. Administrative Phase</h3>

<p>Now, we can play.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Note, because ambush, the US player is severely limited on Turn 1.</p>

<h3 id="reinforcement-phase-1">1. Reinforcement Phase</h3>

<p>Nothing yet, everyone is on the map from set up.</p>

<h3 id="event-phase-1">2. Event Phase</h3>

<p>US doesn't get this due to ambush. The PAVN rolls 4 and places No
Move/Fire on A/2/7.</p>

<h3 id="action-phase-1">3. Action Phase</h3>

<p>Since only PAVN had action chits, they're the only ones going to take
the initiative Turn 1.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>PAVN 1/33 activates Move, moves into regions with A/2-7 to initiate
Melee. Results, 1 hit on each side. No officer casualties. US
prevails here.  Another PAVN 1/33 moves into adjacent to melee with part of C/2-7</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>8/8 moves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7/8 moves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6/8 moves.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rally-phase-1">4. Rally Phase</h3>

<p>Both PAVN and US can rally one unit because of colocated Officers.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-phase-1">5. Administrative Phase</h3>

<p>VP calculation: 11 PAVN, 10 US.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Last turn was pretty bloody for both sides. This turn probably just as
much.</p>

<h3 id="reinforcement-phase-2">1. Reinforcement Phase</h3>

<p>Mostly US reinforcements, and a bunch of them.</p>

<h3 id="event-phase-2">2. Event Phase</h3>

<p>US roll 3, move B/2-7 towards LZ.</p>

<p>PAVN roll 3, move part of 8/8 in between B/2-7 and LZ.</p>

<h3 id="action-phase-2">3. Action Phase</h3>

<ol>
  <li>US: B/2-7 does ranged fire on PAVN in space between them and LZ.</li>
  <li>US: D/2-7 moves north.</li>
  <li>PAVN: ranged fire from 8/8 on B/2-7.</li>
  <li>US: A/2-7 moves north.</li>
  <li>PAVN: 6/8 moves west to melee C/2-7. C/2-7 retreats after first
round.</li>
  <li>PAVN: Adrenaline.</li>
  <li>PAVN: Move 10/8 2 spaces west.</li>
  <li>US: B/2-7 fires into 8/8, scores 4 hits, takes no hits in return.</li>
  <li>PAVN: 10/8 moves into LZ Albany.</li>
  <li>PAVN: 1/33 fires onto D/2-7, scores 2, loses 1.</li>
  <li>PAVN: 1/33 does it again, scores another hit, takes none.</li>
  <li>US: Artillery, scores 2 total hits on 8/8.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rally-phase-2">4. Rally Phase</h3>

<p>PAVN not lucky on rally rolls.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-phase-2">5. Administrative Phase</h3>

<p>Clean up.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>From just this small amount of playing, I can see that ranged fire is
useful for wearing down units in advance of an assault, i.e., melee.</p>

<p>I don't understand the rule for fire on ovestacking. The example implies
that 6 platoons (US) would induce a "No Fire" situation on the that
region. Which doesn't make sense. It would make sense to switch a die
for each extra unit to friendly fire, but not to reduce the units
firing. I had understood the PAVN units were companies, something I
should double check.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
