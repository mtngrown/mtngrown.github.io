                Phantom Leader Linebacker kickoff
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 28 2017</time>
              <p>This is my second "game" of Phantom Leader, and my first where I'm
              handling everything straight from the rules without recourse to Youtube,
              forums, etc. I'll have a bit more to say about the rules later.</p>
              
              <p>At the moment, my biggest question is exactly how to count plays of this
              game? The real action is admittedly in the campaign scenarios, but isn't
              it just as viable to fly a single mission for scoring? I'm torn here
              because I do keep stats, and it will make a difference in how the stats
              resolve. For example, a long campaign is 12 missions. Is one play or 12
              plays? I haven't yet decided.</p>
              
              <p>In the meantime, here's how the first Linebacker mission of the short
              campaign played out.</p>
              
              <h2 id="linebacker-usn-short-campaign-parameters">Linebacker USN, short campaign parameters</h2>
              
              <p>(This pisses me off: I took notes on this play through on my iPad, which
              decided to use fucking "Smart Lists" for the phase numbering. Which of course
              didn't carry over into email.  I'm not a big fan of public profanity, but this
              fucking pisses me off, as there is apparently no option for taking notes in
              flat text.)</p>
              
              <hr />
              
              <p>I'm playing the short USN Linebacker campaign, which is 4 days and grants 16 Special Option (SO) points.</p>
              
              <p>Here's a go at a turn sequence.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-sequence">Turn Sequence</h2>
              
              <h3 id="preflight">Preflight</h3>
              
              <p><code>1.</code> <strong>Draw target cards</strong> First two targets are Flak Trap 41 and Minor Bridge 8.</p>
              
              <p><code>2.</code> <strong>Select target and move Politics Counter</strong> I'm choosing Flak Trap
              for the first mission, it allows 3 planes, and does not move the Politics
              marker. However it's a stress 3 and -2 WP.</p>
              
              <p><code>3.</code> <strong>Determine and place sites</strong></p>
              
              <p><code>4.</code> <strong>Assign pilots</strong></p>
              
              <p>Here's the lineup for the campaign:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Buick, skilled-9</li>
                <li>Easy Money, average-7</li>
                <li>Whiplash, average-6</li>
                <li>Taxi, average-5</li>
                <li>Griz, average-5</li>
                <li>Gringo, green-6</li>
                <li>Firefly, green-4</li>
                <li>Pluto, newbie-4</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Mission will be flown by Pluto, Firefly and Buick.</p>
              
              <p>Pluto flies the A-4, which adds 3 SO.</p>
              
              <p>Apparently there are Campaign turns and Mission turns. Mission turns are always
              5 and are on the board. Not sure what a Campaign  turn is, it might be 1 day.</p>
              
              <p>How many missions can be flown in a day? I don't know, so I'm not going to
              worry about it until after I have the first mission flown.</p>
              
              <p><code>5.</code> <strong>Arm aircraft</strong></p>
              
              <p>Time to load out. Will load only GBU-10 special weapons for first mission,
              costs 2 SO.</p>
              
              <p>Target 41 is -2 WP.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Pluto: Mk. 83, AGM-45.</li>
                <li>Firefly: BLU-1, GBU-10, Mk. 82</li>
                <li>Buick: AIM-9x3, Mk. 82se</li>

              <p><code>14.</code> <strong>Return fire</strong> Pluto is targeted by M1939, rolls 8, Pluto is destroyed. Bummer.
              But let's roll for an evasion, roll 6, this puts a Stress 1 marker on Pluto.
              That's everything in range right now, time for the slow folks to fire.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>

                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game

                  a very large or long game.

                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
