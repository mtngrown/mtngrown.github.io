March Game Day at CCB
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar  4 2017</time>
<p>Another fine afternoon game day at CCB. We had one other person, FB, who
stayed late, and we got some good games in.</p>

<p>Eldritch Horror: I came into the game after CC and FB started, so I just
picked up a character and jumped right in. That's one of the cool things
about the game, people can come and go at will. It would be conceivable
even for a person to join, play one turn, then leave. Their character
could just go into Delay mode.</p>

<p>Red Dragon Inn: This definitely plays better with 3 people, and probably
even better with 4. I feel better about getting it now.</p>

<p>Zeppelin Attack: Three players with the fresh, new deck from the
publisher, which was card complete. So now I have an almost complete
spare copy, for which I can provide spare cards to others. In any case,
I managed to win this as Der Blitzman. That 2x VP on the special blimp
makes it compelling to attack a lot.</p>

<p>Pandemic: Virulent Strain. Yellow this time. We managed to eradicate
yellow, but still lost the game on too many outbreaks. It would have
been a very near thing to have won it otherwise, we had so few cards
left in the player deck, and no one had enough to cure the final blue.
We're still not planning this out in advance far enough.</p>

<p>6 Nimmt!: Once again, I lose super big! Despite losing so badly at this
game, I still like playing it because it's always good for some laughs.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
