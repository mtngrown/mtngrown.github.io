Teaching myself Race for the Galaxy
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 10 2017</time>
<p><em>Race for the Galaxy</em> is billed as a fast-playing card game, and is
immensely popular. As part of my goal to broaden the number of games and
types of games I'm comfortable playing, it seemed like an excellent
candidate, so I'm teaching myself.</p>

<p>As is usual for these sorts of "light" non-wargames, the rules are very
thin, and there is a lot of iconography to learn and interpret. I'm
really bad at this sort of thing. Since I'm teaching myself, I'm relying
on Youtube videos to keep my motivated, and to help me understand the
icons.</p>

<p>One good thing I'm getting out of this first solo game is a new ability
to teach myself these sorts of games. The trick is similar to learning
wargames, where I usually start with throwing some counters on the map
to push around and fight, then work through the turn sequence.</p>

<p>In this case, I'm just throwing some cards down without any particular
regard to how to actually play those cards. It's more about getting the
fundamental mechanics under control.</p>

<p>For the first few turns, I did mostly Explore, Settle and Develop. The
idea is get a few cards out in a tableau.</p>

<hr />

<p>Note: This game was started on March 10, and continued over the course of a
few days. In the meantime, I played a couple of games with AW, which
helped me understand more about how the iconpgraphy works. We now resume
our game.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now that I see how Explore, Settle and Develop are working, it's time to
work out the details for Produce and Consume.</p>

<p>Side note: when playing solitaire to learn how all the cards work, there
is no need for simultaneous turns. I can alternate on the turns as I
usually do with other card games, passing a challenge coin back and
forth to indicate who's turn it is.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grey planets don't produce, but they may enable production on other
planets.</li>
  <li>Windfall worlds are always white, with the particular color in the
halo.</li>
</ul>

<p>And after a bunch more Produce and Consume, I have game.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I was hoping to be able to knock out a solo game in a couple of hours,
but it doesn't seem to work that way for me. It takes me many, many
hours, usually spread over a couple of days, to get a basic grip on one
of these sorts of games. I think, coming from a wargaming background,
that the rules are just so strange to me in comparison. That, and I
expect to spend a couple of days on wargames.</p>

<p>Here's what the end of the game looked like:</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
