<p>Spent the afternoon at AW's in Hercules playing a first game of
Downtown. I've been wanting to play this for ages, and now that I'm
taking a mini-sabbatical, it was time to get it on the table.</p>

<p>Downtown is a complex game, at least to me. There are a lot of charts
and tables, and while the turn sequence appears short, the subsequences
are buried in the rules, adding to the complexity. After a first play,
I'm calling it between OCS and EFS in complexity.</p>

<p>We played the first scenario collaboratively to learn how everything
worked. This scenario, "Surfin' Bird" feature one flight of 2 A-4s and a
flight of 2 MIG-17Fs. We went 6-8 turns with it, in a little under 4
hours. The later turns went pretty fast.</p>

<p>While the rules feel complex to me, I can see how once they're
internalized, game play should be pretty smooth as there aren't that
many counters on the map at any one time.</p>

<h2 id="race-for-the-galaxy">Race for the Galaxy</h2>

<p>I've been having trouble figuring this one out on my own. Fortunately AW
has a copy and is very good at it, so we played a couple of games. This
really helped me get the hang of it better, but I'm still having trouble
with the icons. Here's how the games finished:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AW: 35, me 32.</li>
  <li>AW: 54, me 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a ways to go.</p>

<h2 id="star-realms">Star Realms</h2>

<p>AW hadn't ever played Star Realms, so I taught how to play. Of course,
he won! I was a couple of hands away from having some very big cards to
play, but I just didn't get there fast enough.</p>

<p>All in all, a good day.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
