                Downtown, & Race for the Galaxy
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 11 2017</time>
              <p>Spent the afternoon at AW's in Hercules playing a first game of
              Downtown. I've been wanting to play this for ages, and now that I'm
              taking a mini-sabbatical, it was time to get it on the table.</p>
              
              <p>Downtown is a complex game, at least to me. There are a lot of charts
              and tables, and while the turn sequence appears short, the subsequences
              are buried in the rules, adding to the complexity. After a first play,
              I'm calling it between OCS and EFS in complexity.</p>
              
              <p>We played the first scenario collaboratively to learn how everything
              worked. This scenario, "Surfin' Bird" feature one flight of 2 A-4s and a
              flight of 2 MIG-17Fs. We went 6-8 turns with it, in a little under 4
              hours. The later turns went pretty fast.</p>
              
              <p>While the rules feel complex to me, I can see how once they're
              internalized, game play should be pretty smooth as there aren't that
              many counters on the map at any one time.</p>
              
              <h2 id="race-for-the-galaxy">Race for the Galaxy</h2>
              
              <p>I've been having trouble figuring this one out on my own. Fortunately AW
              has a copy and is very good at it, so we played a couple of games. This
              really helped me get the hang of it better, but I'm still having trouble
              with the icons. Here's how the games finished:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>AW: 35, me 32.</li>
                <li>AW: 54, me 33.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>I have a ways to go.</p>
              
              <h2 id="star-realms">Star Realms</h2>
              
              <p>AW hadn't ever played Star Realms, so I taught how to play. Of course,
              he won! I was a couple of hands away from having some very big cards to
              play, but I just didn't get there fast enough.</p>
              
              <p>All in all, a good day.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
