<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 13 2017</time>
<p>I'm making a slight course adjustment on my <a href="/2016/12/31/2017-mastery-challenge.html">2017 Mastery
Challenge</a>. Since I have all
this time on my hands, it makes sense (to me) to learn a bunch of my
unplayed games, focusing on games with high replay value. And definitely
to knock out all my unplayed non-wargames, of which there aren't that
many, around 10.</p>

<p>This change of focus will reduce my average played games down into the
4+ range, but that's ok. Since the games I'm focusing on will have high
replay value, I'll get my play average back sooner or later. Once I
start working, I won't have the energy to wade through a bunch of new
games in rapid succession.</p>

<p>For non-wargame, I'm planning on the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/13/mancala-1.html">Mancala</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/13/connect-four-1.html">Connect 4</a></li>

  <li><a href="/2017/03/15/pandemic-contagion-1.html">Pandemic Contagion</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/17/leaving-earth-first-play.html">Leaving Earth</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/18/lord-of-the-rings-lcg.html">Lord of the Rings LCG</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/20/digging-into-android-netrunner.html">Android Netrunner</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/24/high-frontier-initial-thoughts.html">High Frontier</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/26/dresden-files-cooperative-card-game.html">Dresden Files</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/23/the-agents.html">The Agents</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/22/lord-of-the-rings-co-op-first-play.html">Lord of the Rings Co-op</a></li>
  <li>Caverna</li>
  <li><a href="/2017/04/02/frag-first-play.html">Frag</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/27/ancient-terrible-things.html">Ancient Terrible Things</a></li>
  <li>Zombicide</li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/25/awful-green-things-from-outer-space.html">Awful Green Things from Outer
Space</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/22/blokus-1.html">Blokus</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the above have pretty high replay value. A few may only see this
one play, but that's ok as I bought these games to play. A couple, like
Mancala and Connect 4 are relatively humdrum with respect to the snob
appeal of some of the other games, which is fine. I still enjoy these
sorts of games, and they're widely played which makes it worthwhile
knowing how to play them.</p>

<p>I was just perusing some of the games listed on Tabletopia, and I
recalled at least of the games they have listed I have in shrink, and
it's not in the above list. Along with that one, I recall having at
least a couple more in shrink which aren't listed above. I think I'll
just leave them in shrink for now, and worry about playing those later.
The above list will keep me plenty busy. (I added the remaining
in-shrink games after all!)</p>

<p>For wargames, here's a preliminary list:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/14/the-arduous-beginning-1.html">The Arduous Beginning</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/15/ottoman-sunset-first-play.html">Ottoman Sunset</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/16/last-battle-ie-shima-1945.html">Ie Shima</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/03/21/panzer-leader-1-situation-20-remagen-bridge.html">Panzer
Leader</a></li>
  <li>Platoon</li>
  <li>First Team</li>
  <li>No Retreat Russian Front</li>
  <li>Return of the Stainless Steel Rat</li>
  <li>Khe Sanh '68</li>
  <li>Talon</li>
  <li>Raid on St. Nazare</li>
  <li>Labyrinth</li>
  <li>Falling Sky</li>
  <li>GD '40</li>
  <li>Alesia</li>
  <li>Seige of Jerusalem</li>
  <li>Cityfight</li>
  <li>Firepower</li>
</ol>

<p>(I keep adding to this list, it started at 15 games.)</p>

<p>Some of these don't have much reply value, but are games I have some
interest in for one reason or another, and it seems like a good time to
knock out a play. Other games, such as Alesia and Siege of Jerusalem,
are big enough that getting in a play while I'm on this mini-sabbatical
is just a good idea, especially as I have opponents interested in
playing them. Really hard to get these set up otherwise.</p>

<p>Getting all these played puts my game count over 100 games, with a
minimum of 477 plays. The actual number of plays will likely be over 500
as I do have ongoing games of Hive on BGA, and will be playing other
games with other people along the way. As I think of it, I have a game
of Tet scheduled for later in March.</p>

<p>Once all these games are played once, I'll continue along my H-index
trajectory, and continue to knock out Nickels, Dimes and a few more
Vietnam games. Next year I believe I might focus on getting second plays
of the above and other games I only have a single play of.</p>

<h3 id="update">Update</h3>

<p>Having just written a check for COBRA coverage, it's clear I need to get
back under employer covered health care as soon as possible. It will
break me otherwise. Shifting gears into job search mode will reduce time
available for tearing into one of the heavier games. This is because
preparing for programming interviews is grueling.</p>

<h3 id="final-update">Final update</h3>

<p>It's April 2, 2017, and I'm calling this one. The idea for the article
was to see how many of these game I could get through in March, because
I need to start looking for work in April. Games are such a huge
distraction. I did well on the unplayed non-wargames, getting everything
but Caverna and Zombicide played. I've also determined Frag will be
leaving my collection for now. I don't have the right group for playing
it, and it doesn't solo in any meaningful way. The box is biggish, so
I'm going to reclaim that shelf space. I'm ambivalent about Awful Green
Things. It's a fun, silly game, but I have a lot of other games I'd
personally rather play, and don't really have anyone who might enjoy it.
It doesn't take up a lot of shelf space, so it's staying for the moment.</p>

<p>All in all, pretty fun time. Would have liked to get Caverna and
Zombicide knocked out, but after ripping the shrink, I just didn't have
the energy to dig into either. Would also have liked to get a few more
wargames played, but again, wargames are much more time consuming, and
the opportunity to knock out <em>all</em> the non-wargames was just too
tempting.</p>

<p>I don't know when I'll have another opportunity to do something like
this again. Possibly when I retire. Hopefully sooner.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
