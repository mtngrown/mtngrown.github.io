The Arduous Beginning 1
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 14 2017</time>
<p><em>The Arduous Beginning</em> is the last of four Frank Chadwick eastern front
games published by Victory Point Games in my collection. This is my
first play of the game.</p>

<p>Setting it up, it feels familiar: a large, powerful German force on the
left (west), sparse, weaker Soviet forces on the right (east). Since the
rules to these games are very similar, my plan as the Germans is to race
to the eastern edge and cut off communication on the map to prevent
Soviet replacements. I will attempt to do this as fast as possible.</p>

<p>The Soviets task is to keep open communication on the eastern edge,
specifically, ensure at least one hex remains free of a German counter
or EZOC.</p>

<p>Here's what the setup looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-start.jpg" alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1
start" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>The Germans didn't get as far as they'd hoped, they got a <code>NE</code> result
against one of the Soviet armies in the south, which is kind of a
blocker.</p>

<p>Here's the situation after the Soviet response:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t1.jpg" alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
1" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>The Soviets are stronger early on in this game, much more so than in any
of the other three games in the series. Take a look at the situation
below, and see that the Soviets practically have a second line
established:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t2.jpg" alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
2" /></p>

<p>All those swamps in the south are cramping Nazi style.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Soviets are definitely well into the game here. I'm suspecting this is
going to be just like the others in the series: impossible to win as the
Germans, until it's hard to lose as the Germans. Here's what the end of
Turn 3 looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t3.jpg" alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
3" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>Approaching the half way point in the game. Can the Germans pull it off?
Not looking good for them right now.</p>

<p>The Soviets have developed a habit of rolling 1s when faced with
overwhelming odds, and retreating right into the Germans path of
advance. Most annoying!</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t4.jpg" alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
4" /></p>

<p>And it's half done.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>The game may be half done, but the Germans are pretty much all done.
They need to make a bunch of low odds attacks and get super lucky.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t5.jpg" alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
5" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>As stated above, Germans need to get super lucky. You can see for
yourself how lucky they got below:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t6.jpg" alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
6" /></p>

<p>Soviets have been really good at rolling 1s this game when faced with
4:1 odds.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: there is a mistake in the picture above, the Soviet armies
were accidently brought in at full strength, all 3 of them! While I
don't believe that would change the outcome much (German loss), it skews
the final situation badly.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7-and-end">Turn 7 and end</h2>

<p>One turn too late:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t7.jpg" alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
7" /></p>

<p>The Germans finally get control of the map, but at least and probably
two turns too late.</p>

<p>I'll be playing this again of course, probably many, many times as it
will go faster in the future.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
