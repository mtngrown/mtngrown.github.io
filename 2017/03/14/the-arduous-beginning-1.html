                The Arduous Beginning 1
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 14 2017</time>
              <p><em>The Arduous Beginning</em> is the last of four Frank Chadwick eastern front
              games published by Victory Point Games in my collection. This is my
              first play of the game.</p>
              
              <p>Setting it up, it feels familiar: a large, powerful German force on the
              left (west), sparse, weaker Soviet forces on the right (east). Since the
              rules to these games are very similar, my plan as the Germans is to race
              to the eastern edge and cut off communication on the map to prevent
              Soviet replacements. I will attempt to do this as fast as possible.</p>
              
              <p>The Soviets task is to keep open communication on the eastern edge,
              specifically, ensure at least one hex remains free of a German counter
              or EZOC.</p>
              
              <p>Here's what the setup looks like:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1
              start" src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-start.jpg" /></p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
              
              <p>The Germans didn't get as far as they'd hoped, they got a <code>NE</code> result
              against one of the Soviet armies in the south, which is kind of a
              blocker.</p>
              
              <p>Here's the situation after the Soviet response:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
              1" src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t1.jpg" /></p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
              
              <p>The Soviets are stronger early on in this game, much more so than in any
              of the other three games in the series. Take a look at the situation
              below, and see that the Soviets practically have a second line
              established:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
              2" src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t2.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>All those swamps in the south are cramping Nazi style.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
              
              <p>Soviets are definitely well into the game here. I'm suspecting this is
              going to be just like the others in the series: impossible to win as the
              Germans, until it's hard to lose as the Germans. Here's what the end of
              Turn 3 looks like:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
              3" src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t3.jpg" /></p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>
              
              <p>Approaching the half way point in the game. Can the Germans pull it off?
              Not looking good for them right now.</p>
              
              <p>The Soviets have developed a habit of rolling 1s when faced with
              overwhelming odds, and retreating right into the Germans path of
              advance. Most annoying!</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
              4" src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t4.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>And it's half done.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>
              
              <p>The game may be half done, but the Germans are pretty much all done.
              They need to make a bunch of low odds attacks and get super lucky.</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
              5" src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t5.jpg" /></p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>
              
              <p>As stated above, Germans need to get super lucky. You can see for
              yourself how lucky they got below:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
              6" src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t6.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Soviets have been really good at rolling 1s this game when faced with
              4:1 odds.</p>
              
              <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: there is a mistake in the picture above, the Soviet armies
              were accidently brought in at full strength, all 3 of them! While I
              don't believe that would change the outcome much (German loss), it skews
              the final situation badly.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-7-and-end">Turn 7 and end</h2>
              
              <p>One turn too late:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="The Arduous Beginning Game 1 Turn
              7" src="/images/the-arduous-beginning/g1-t7.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>The Germans finally get control of the map, but at least and probably
              two turns too late.</p>
              
              <p>I'll be playing this again of course, probably many, many times as it
              will go faster in the future.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
