<p>This was a really good game, which I almost (as black) lost about half
way through, but ended up winning as opponent did not exploit his or her
advantage.</p>

<p>The key move was about half way through the game, when I had 10 of my
pieces down to white's 5 pieces. Had white played an ant, I could
have been hard pressed to win. Instead, opponent placed a hopper in a
position which was useless. Later, opponent moved that hopper to give me
the clinch move, a spider in an interior partial ring. That spider
slotted right in next to opponent's queen, leaving me to drop a beetle
or ant in the remaining position for the win.</p>

<p>I was very patient with this game when I was in a position of losing it.
My early and mid-game continues to suck, but I think I'm getting better
at the end-game. I feel like I'm better able to exploit opponent's
mistakes, in any case. Although winning by hoping opponent's make
mistakes is not a long term strategy for success.</p>

<p>Was a very good game, here's the final situation:</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
