<p>I played white in this game, and I haven't been whipped so badly in
months.</p>

<p>This emphasizes that rankings aren't that important, the opponent here
was 100 points under me in ranking, and tore me a new asshole, and fast,
too. He was way ahead of me pretty much the whole game.</p>

<p>To be more fair to myself, I made <em>at least</em> three major blunders the
last of which just clinched the game for black. And black made mistakes
I didn't capitalize on I'm sure.</p>

<p>Here's the end of the game, and note how much perimeter control I have
as white, and what a fat lot of good that did me here:</p>

<p>This game is worth working through piecewise. There are situations which
should be in my library of personal hive moves. Since it's closing on
midnight, not going to do this tonight.</p>

<p>Interesting that the opponent has been on the site for 6 days and played
55 games of Hive so far. That's more than I've played in over 2 years
total. The ranking doesn't make sense, this player should rank higher
with a 62% win rate.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
