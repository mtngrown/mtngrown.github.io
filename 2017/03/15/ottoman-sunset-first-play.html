Ottoman Sunset first play
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 15 2017</time>
<p>As part of my unplayed games effort, I thought I'd get this little
States of Siege title played. It also counts for one of my 2017 Nickels,
so no better time than the present to knock out a play.</p>

<p>This will proceed as usual, the cards listed out in the order they get
drawn, with a bit of commentary about what I decided to do. There are a
number of odd pieces in this game, I'll figure out what to do with them
when I pull the relevant events.</p>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>19</code> Senussi Revolt. Purchase +1 resource.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>04</code> Enver to the Front. Both actions against Caucasus, both rolls
failed, ugh. Off to a great start already.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>18</code> Bulgaria joins the Central Powers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>17</code> Grand Duke Nicholas takes control.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>01</code> Intelligence Bureau of the East.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>07</code> Turkish Minelaying. One mine standee placed for free. Spent
another action to emplace the Dardanos gun.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>03</code> Jihad Declared. Day cards go in. I keep failing rolls on
offensive with very low values, like 2 and 3, not good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>29</code> Brusilov Offensive. Victory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>33</code> Yudenich Named Commander in Chief.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11</code> Gallipoli Landings. Gallipoli track now in play. Placed the
last Turkish gun in The Narrows. Now let's see what happens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>26</code> Verdun. Victory. Still rolling super bad on Caucasus front.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>31</code> The Somme. Victory. Dang. Winning the battles, this is good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>25</code> Erzurum Offensive. Resource for Eastern Theater.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>05</code> Ghadar Conspiracy. Coup in India fails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20</code> Landings at Salonika. Caucasus is in it's 1 box, next card
could be game over if Causasus advances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>28</code> Jutland. Defeat. Managed to push back Gallipolli and Caucasus
fronts to their 2 spaces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13</code> Italy joins the War. Victory. Salonika and Gallipolli pushed
back a space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27</code> Mesopotamian Siege. I'm now doing about as well as I usually do
at these States of Siege games, getting to the 17th card. Caucasus
is again on its 1 box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>21</code> Central Powers Meddling in Afghanistan. Caucasus advance into
Constantinople, and that's the game!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, well, the whole rest of the map looks great except I kept rolling 1s
and 2s against Caucasus, and it kept advancing. I suppose I could have
spent more actions attempting to control it, but that's in the nature of
the risk, I had a better than even chance of beating it back, but the
die didn't roll for me there. Bummer.</p>

<p>In any case, lots of good, new historical events to look up. This game
feels easier than Hapsburg Eclipse, there doesn't seem to be quite as
much going on.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
