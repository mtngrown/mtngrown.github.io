                Last Battle: Ie Shima, 1945
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 16 2017</time>
              <p>I've got Rinella's <em>Last Battle: Ie Shima, 1945</em> set up and ready to
              play. I've read through the rules, mostly, and it doesn't look too
              difficult. It does look a bit odd in terms of how turns and impulses are
              structured, and the combat system is definitely odd. I don't mind the
              learning a new impulse system, but I would be surprised if the combat
              couldn't be as effectively modeled by a CRT or possibly the Fire &amp;
              Movement combat factor difference just as well.</p>
              
              <p>In any case, no big deal. I'll reserve judgement until after I've played
              through the game.</p>
              
              <p>Let's get started.</p>

              <h6 id="japanese">Japanese</h6>
              
              <p>Nothing to do, can't bombard beach staging area, units are already set
              up, pass.  On rereading, Japanese Special Unit box is considered an
              area, so these units may have been available to move, not sure.</p>
              
              <h6 id="us">US</h6>
              
              <p>Assault the beach I guess. Landing is uncontested for 1/306 and 2/306.
              Apparently that's it for first impulse.</p>

              <p>Bombard the 1/305/A in Area 1. Japanese roll 7 + 4, US rolls 5 + 1,
              attrition to 5. This eliminates 1/305/A for 3 Attrition Points (AP), 1
              AP each for reducing 1/305/B,C. Not sure to put eliminated units.</p>

              <p>US assaults with 1,2/306 into Area 4. US leads with 1/306/A, Japanese
              lead with Labor/A. US roll 5 + 11 (combat strength) + 2 (regimental
              integrity), Japanese roll 8 + 5 (combat) + 1 (TEM) for 18 to 14.</p>
              
              <p>Result: Labor/A flips to reduced, need 4 points of AP. Flipping all of
              Labor for 4 AP. Japanese got relatively lucky here.</p>
              
              <p>Sunset roll 5, still Daylight.</p>

              <p>And that's the end of the impulses for Turn 1.</p>
              
              <h3 id="refit-phase">Refit Phase</h3>

                <li>Japanese, Labor-A,B brought back reduced in Area 16</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3 id="end-phase">End Phase</h3>
              
              <p>Technically, it's an automatic US victory as US is holding Area 4
              (airfield) at the end of the first turn. I'm going to ignore that for
              now and keep playing to see how it works out.</p>
              
              <p>Here's the situation at the end of Turn 1:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Ie Shima Game 1 Turn 1" src="/images/ie-shima/g1.jpg" /></p>
              
              <hr />
              
              <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
              
              <p>I'm not going to do the blow-by-blow on Turn 2 impulses, there is no
              need, the game is simple enough I can follow the action well enough on
              the board, and crank out a set of impulses while interstitially with
              chores and whatnot.</p>
              
              <h3 id="reinforcement-phase-1">Reinforcement Phase</h3>
              
              <h4 id="japanese-12">Japanese</h4>
              
              <p>Roll 10 for 5 reinforcements. Dang. US eliminated 6 units first turn,
              now almost all of them are coming back on the board. Except 2 of the
              elimated units are Labor, so only 4 Specials make it into the holding
              box.</p>
              
              <h4 id="american">American</h4>
              
              <p>2,3/307 land on the beach.</p>
              
              <p>Tighten the noose around the hill.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
              
              <p>Not looking good for US, lots of not good bombardment results.</p>
              
              <h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>
              
              <p>The US decided to go for broke and clear the map, enough reductions and
              eliminated units meant that it would be hard win via points. It almost
              worked, but they weren't able to clear the pillbox out of Area 11.</p>
              
              <p>Points: Area score gets 12 points. Reduced and eliminated total is 14,
              which is -2 points, so that's a US win.</p>
              
              <p>To be perfectly honest, US got some very lucky rolls on the final turn
              bombardment, which helped take Area 16.</p>
              
              <p>Here's the situation at the end of the game:</p>
              
              <p class="center"><img alt="Ie Shima Game 1 end" src="/images/ie-shima/g1-end.jpg" /></p>
              
              <p>Interesting little game.</p>
              
              <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
              
              <p>Some questions:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Taking attrition as a defender isn't clear. The lead unit flips to
              reduced, does that count for AP? I'm going to say it does.</li>
                <li>Regimental Integrity bonus, if two regiments are fighting, is that a
              +2, or just a +1?</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>CC will probably want to play this.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
