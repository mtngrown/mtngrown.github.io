Leaving Earth first play
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 17 2017</time>
<p><em>Leaving Earth</em> is one of those games I saw someone else set up and
playing, and just knew I had to have it. I picked it up about a year
ago, and have been put off by the rules several times. The usual pattern
is grabbing up the rules for some bedtime reading, getting stymied,
putting it away, repeat.</p>

<p>This time I hauled it out with the intention of at least banging through
a mission or two, and not worry overmuch about getting everything
exactly right.</p>

<p>Jumping right in:</p>

<h3 id="easy-probe-to-suborbital-flight">1. Easy: Probe to suborbital flight</h3>

<p><code>1956</code>: 3 Juno rocket with 4 thrust each boosts a probe to Suborbital
Flight, mission success, no blow ups, 1 VP gained. Had a left over $10,
so picked up the Atlas rocket advancement.</p>

<h3 id="easy-man-to-space-and-back">2. Easy: Man to space and back</h3>

<p><code>1957</code> Will require a larger rocket, and
life support capsule. All this costs a load of cash, $19 just get
everything and John to the launch pad. Whence the damn thing blows up.
Good bye John Glenn, we hardly knew ya. I have $1 remaining, buying
supplies for future missions. Difficulty 3 x Mass 5 = 15, Thrust is 27,
we're good.</p>

<p><code>1958</code> Redux. $14 just to get in the game,
let's launch again…Major Failure! This time I can pay $5 to discard
that Major Failure. But I don't have enough to do another full mission,
I'll buy some stuff: another Atlas and more supplies.</p>

<p><code>1959</code> Third attempt: Alan Shepard and another
Eagle capsule runs me $9, but I have a lot left to do stuff with. Let's
launch: Success! Now here's the conundrum: should I pay $10 to discard
the reentry success, or $10 to pick up a Saturn rocket? Pay $10 to
discard, there is another reentry mission coming. I have another $6
left, will pick up an Atlas rocket, will need 2 to get a man into earth
orbit.</p>

<p>I don't think I'm playing this right, but I'm having fun!</p>

<h3 id="easy-working-probe-in-earth-orbit">3. Easy: Working Probe in earth orbit</h3>

<p><code>1960</code> Difficulty 8 x Mass 10 = 80, this requires a Soyuz. Launch this
bad boy, Success! Purchase an Atlas and Juno with the remaining $6.</p>

<h3 id="easy-man-to-earth-orbit-and-back">4. Easy: Man to Earth orbit and back</h3>

<p><code>1961</code> This one requires 2 Soyuz, expensive. Launch is…success and
success. Purchase probe and another Atlas with remaining cash.</p>

<h3 id="easy-reveal-moon-location">5. Easy: Reveal Moon location</h3>

<p><code>1962</code> Get a probe to the moon. This is substantially more complicated.
Basically all I can do this year is purchase the Saturn advancement and
a Saturn rocket.</p>

<p><code>1963</code> Launch Saturn with Atlas and Probe…success…Atlas to launch
Probe into Lunar orbit…success…surveying…success.</p>

<p>And that's the 5 easy missions for a starter game.</p>

<p>I'll think I'll end it here for now. I have a lot of questions which I
don't really understand how to ask, so it's time to read through the
forums and watch some videos. I'll set this up again, for sure!</p>

<p>Here's the end of the game:</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
