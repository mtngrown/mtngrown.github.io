<p>I've had Panzer Leader for years. I had intended on playing through all
the scenarios in 2015, after I finished all the scenarios in
PanzerBlitz. Since I never finished all the scenarios in PanzerBlitz
(still haven't), this never got played.</p>

<p>But it's played now!</p>

<p>I chose the first play to be the last scenario, Situation #20, Remagen
Bridge. It has a very few counter, and plays on half of one map board,
very convenient for a fast solo game.</p>

<p>And the situation is a cute little puzzle. I didn't see any way for the
Germans to win it, as it seemed clear that the Allied would just park on
the bridge and clear the block.</p>

<p>But it didn't turn out that way.</p>

<p>For the armor to fire into the town, it needs to be on a forward slope,
hence amenable to fire from the mortar and howitzer unit. The German
defenders also need to be spotted, which requires Allied infantry to
park on the bridge. But that leaves them vulnerable to CAT, and
successful CAT means those units can't spot for the armor.</p>

<p>I didn't think until later in the game to use direct fire on the
Allied infantry to try and pick them off one by one. The idea would be
to concentrate fire on, say, an Allied engineer unit to disperse it,
then the followup CAT from the Germans to hopefully get a <code>DD</code> result
and eliminate it.</p>

<p>I ended the game at the top of Turn 6 (of 8) when the Germans dispersed
the Allied engineers again. This turns out to have been a mistake,
dispersing an engineer unit halts the 3 turn clock. The engineers have
to be eliminated to reset it.</p>

<p>So I called this one a German win, but I think it would have been an
Allied win had the block removal been played correctly.</p>

<p>I'll play this one again for sure, cool puzzle and plays fast.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
