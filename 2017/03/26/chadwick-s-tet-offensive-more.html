Chadwick's Tet Offensive & more
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 26 2017</time>
<p>We're back to Vietnam today, examining the Tet Offensive as interpreted
by Frank Chadwick.</p>

<p>First, the map. It's mounted, and garishly colored, with stylized
polygonal provinces. This isn't that big of a deal in itself. However,
there are two problematic design issues:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some of the necessary text on the map is black on dark green
background, rendering the text very difficult to read.</li>
  <li>Some of the locations are very small, and will need to host tall
stacks of counters. The small provinces are mostly close together,
and around Saigon, compounding the problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other than these two issues, I don't really have a problem with the map.</p>

<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the game</h3>

<p>The rules are not lengthy or difficult, and the games plays relatively
quickly. We could see it possible to play it in maybe 90 minutes once we
were more comfortable with the rules.</p>

<p>I played the US side. I didn't understand what to do with the RF/PF
forces, so I left them off the map. There doesn't seem to be anything in
the rules about where to emplace them.</p>

<p>We also found the flag standees to be too cumbersome, so we used the
insurrection markers instead.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting concepts in the game is using
"demoralization" as a victory condition. Demoralization is computed from
cities lost, forces taken casualty and the like. Each force (US, ARVN,
VC, NVA) has its own demoralization sudden death. For the NVA/VC to win,
they need to force this by the end of the last turn. Since the game only
has 5 turns, they can't be wasting any time about it.</p>

<p>We learned that the VC and NVA need to strike very hard and very early
in the game, because for the first tow turns (out of 5 turns total), the
US and ARVN forces have extremely limited movement, they simply won't be
able to respond quickly. The trick for the reds is to take more ground
in two turns than the US and ARVN can win back in three. Since the US
and ARVN has movement phase at the end of the turn, this is almost like
having two turns.</p>

<p>We'll be playing this again I'm sure.</p>

<p>Here's the end of the game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/tet-offensive/g1-end.jpg" alt="Tet Offensive Game 1" /></p>

<h3 id="objective-218">Objective 218</h3>

<p>I was going to hold off on more games of this in favor of bumping
H-index to 12 with Fire in the Lake, but AS wanted to play it, so why
not? We played two games:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I won this one pretty fast as AS placed to right instead of pushing
me back on the left. This was a command post win.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another win for me, I seem to do pretty well at this game, unlike
Zombie Dice or 6 Nimmt! This game went down to the wire, and I was
able to sneak in behind with a LGEV to zap the CP, then occupy the CP
with my next card. I think I had 1 or 2 cards left in my hand.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I'm still finding more strategy in this game. I would have thought it
played out in a dozen games.</p>

<h3 id="zombie-dice">Zombie Dice</h3>

<p>I'm trying very hard to break my losing streak with this game. So far, I
seem to be almost at the break even point, where I'm almost winning as
many games as I lose. We played two games:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I won this one! Finally! And by a good score, 14 to 5. But it was
close: AS's situation into the last roll was 9 brains with one blast…
and 2 more blasts! Is this the start of my winning streak?
Let's play again and find out…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No! The winning streak is stillborn! I lost this game 14-13 despite
starting 6 brains ahead. Dammit!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once again, much hilarity.</p>

<h3 id="star-realms-colony-wars">Star Realms Colony Wars</h3>

<p>Another win for me! By 1 point! I usually lose to AS at Star Realms, so
this is significant. He plays what I can best call a "damage-first"
game, which is not heavy on initial trading, nor does it emphasize
scrapping cards. What this means is that his hands will do a pretty good
chunk of damage fairly early on, and will continue to damage in medium
sized hits along the way. However, he does get hands late in the game
which may be almost all Scout/Viper hands. I'm trying to split the
difference here, with getting some damage cards early, while also trying
to scrap a few cards and have at least some trade every turn.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
