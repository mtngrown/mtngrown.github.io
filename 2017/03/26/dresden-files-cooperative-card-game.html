Dresden Files Cooperative Card Game
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 26 2017</time>
<p>Dresden Files is a game I've been waiting on quite a while. It was a
Kickstarter project launched many months ago. The designer is local, and
I playtested a prototype last year. It finally arrived a couple of days
ago, and I have it set up right now for solo play with the Storm Front book.</p>

<p>Playing…it plays very smoothly. Everything is easy to understand.
Knowing what to do, that's going to be a really tough problem with this
game. Here's the deal: everyone gets an initial set of cards, and there
is no regular redraw of cards during game play. It may be possible to
acquire more cards during the game, but there is no "refresh your hand"
phase. This makes it really tough to decide what to play, as there is no
going back.</p>

<p>Upshot: loss with tie game. This game does play fast, I can see 30
minutes being very achievable.</p>

<p>Here's the end of the game:</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
