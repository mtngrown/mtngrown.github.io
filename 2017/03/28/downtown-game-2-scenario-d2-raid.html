<p>Played game 2 of Downtown, this time playing the D2 raid scenario, which
brings in a lot more rules than the beginner "Surfin' Bird" scenario.</p>

<p>I played the DRV against the US opponent played by AW.</p>

<p>The D2 raid scenario requires digging much deeper into the rules than
the initial Surfin' Bird scenario. This is a good thing. The rules
aren't written as "Programmed Instruction," but having rules which ramp
up scenario intensity is a good thing.</p>

<p>We didn't have a lot of trouble with the rules, other than dealing with
the amount of complexity a simulation at this level of historical detail
demands. AW was a bit miffed, I think, as he seemed to be looking for
more game than simulation, whereas I'm absolutely delighted with the
level of detail provided. It require being familiar with a lot of
subsystems in the game, and that takes time.</p>

<p>One great result of this game is I figured out how to use my dummy
flights. I had them sitting at the airfields not doing anything when I
should have been flying them around to spread confusion.</p>

<p>The game went to the DRV, with a collateral damage point offsetting 5
points awarded to US for heavy damage on the main target.</p>

<p>I'll be reading through the rules in the evenings now that I've got some
game play under my belt. It's starting to make more sense now.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
