<p>Got some replays in today.</p>

<p>We started small and worked our way from easy to complex. First up was
Mancala. Then we moved on to Pandemic: Contagion. (<em>You</em> are the
disease. There is no cure.) We spent the rest of what turned into a
fairly longish day with Leaving Earth.</p>

<p>Here's more details on the games.</p>

<h3 id="mancala">Mancala</h3>

<p>As it turns out, CC has played this game a lot. As in over one hundred
times he's pretty sure. This logs my second and third play.</p>

<p>Game 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CC: 32, winner.</li>
  <li>DD: 15.</li>
</ul>

<p>Game 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CC: 28, winner.</li>
  <li>DD: 16, did <em>slightly</em> better this game.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect we'll be playing a lot more of Mancala in the future. It's a
good game to go into rotation.</p>

<h3 id="pandemic-contagion">Pandemic: Contagion</h3>

<p>Here's the details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CC: 19, winner.</li>
  <li>DD: 15, not as deadly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of us are totally sold on the game. I think this is in part
because we had to get the rules squared away, and possibly it might not
be that great of a game. We both agreed we needed to play it with three
people.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we did play it correctly as two player game with the
third "neutral" player running the cards automatically. This was
definitely an improvement over my solo play.</p>

<p>Which brings us toâ€¦</p>

<h3 id="leaving-earth-game-1">Leaving Earth game 1</h3>

<p>We started with the easiest easy scenario. Here's how it turned out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DD 11: sounding rocket, lunar survey, venus survey</li>
  <li>CC 2: artificial satellite.</li>
</ul>

<p>CC had multiple failures, I tested things big time.</p>

<p>Game ended 1965.</p>

<h3 id="leaving-earth-game-2">Leaving Earth game 2</h3>

<p>From the easiest easy we jumped to the hardest hard scenario. I do not
recall the exact mission cards.</p>

<p>We both had multiple horrible failures during this game, despite
spending loads of time and money testing early on. I was well on my way
to Venus and suffered a Major life support failure, in the late '60s,
and that was that. We both managed to squeak out a mission which partly
mitigated both of us killing 3 astronauts. Here's results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CC: 0, winner.</li>
  <li>DD: -2, loser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly, we were Doing It Wrong.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
