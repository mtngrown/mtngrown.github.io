Lord of the Rings LCG 6

<p>Second play of the bare Lore deck. I'm going to attempt to keep track of
the total number of rounds played during this game. Keeping track isn't
easy when I'm not writing everything up. I get engaged in the game and
forget where I'm at.</p>

<p><code>1.</code> The first round starts badly, losing gaining 3 threat and engaging with
2 spiders without producing any damage to the spiders. Glorfindel take 2
damage of 5, will have to get the healing attachment quick, or I'll lose
this hero with 3 Will. Threat 33.</p>

<p><code>2.</code> Healing Skill attached to Glorfindel, which will protect until a
Treachery card or whatever eliminates attachments. Another location
pulled, only was able to commit 1 Will to Quest, Threat level now 36.
Not looking good for out heroes. I need to get Allies on the board.
Threat level 34.</p>

<p><code>3.</code>Deployed Ally with 1 Will to help with Quest, Attachment to render 0
Will on one enemy in Staging. Net gain is 3 Threat. Pulled another
Spider, so again, no combat for inflicting damage. Threat 38. This is
just getting worse, not even holding my ground here. Really hurting for
resources as well, this deck doesn't have many resources available.</p>

<p><code>4.</code> Deployed another Ally with 1 Will, drew another Spider. This is now
4 spiders engaged, and I don't have enough Attack strength to do
anything about any of them. Threat now 43. I think next turn will end up
being the last. I do <em>not</em> have <em>any</em> Progress markers out. None.</p>

<p><code>5.</code> Still in it, barely. Lost an Ally, but one with 0 Will, so not that
bad. I don't see how I can get through the next turn, I'm going to have
to go undefended against attacks to get enough Will to not get
eliminated. Threat 46.</p>

<p><code>6.</code> Had to Quest everyone, which put Undefended attacks on each Hero,
not good. The result gave me 2 Progress markers though. Threat 47.</p>

<p><code>7.</code> Had to commit all Heroes to Quest again, was able to defend against
some damage. Threat 48.</p>

<p><code>8.</code> Quest phase results in Threat 49, without any way to reduce Threat
during this turn, it's a loss at the end of the turn. Bagging it up
here.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The Lore deck seems weak on it's own, even weaker than the Tactics deck.
I don't think I'll play this deck by itself again after this second try.
This was on easy as well. One possibility going forward is pulling in
some of the healing cards from this deck into one of the other decks.</p>

<p>According to the rules, scoring is for winners, and allows winners to
tune their decks. Losers don't get to score. Seems really stupid to me.
Losers need to tune their decks more than winners.</p>

<p>I think if I played this deck again, I'd soak up damage early on and
heal it to get as much Progress as possible in the first 2-3 turns. Then
spend the next few turns healing up and getting attachments deployed,
etc. Hopefully by then I would have enough of a board to power on
through.</p>

<p>Another thought: allow an engagement to go undefended to save defenders
for attacking. This seems kind of wack, but it might work.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
