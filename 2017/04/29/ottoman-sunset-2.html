Ottoman Sunset 2
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 29 2017</time>
<p>Ottoman Sunset is on my Nickels list for 2017. This will be my second
play. My first play I drew 19 cards. Let's see if I can beat that today.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>01</code> Intelligence Bureau of the East. Marker placed, Meso advances,
offensive fails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>04</code> Enver to the Front. Meso and Caucasus pushed back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>03</code> Jihad Declared. Shuffle Mid-day cards into draw deck. Placed a
minefield, all fronts on their end location.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>32</code> Arab Revolt. Place Feisal Hussein on track. 4 cards in and
looking ok. I need to place those remaining two markers and build up
some resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>31</code> The Somme. Defeat. National Will -1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>29</code> Brusilov Offensive. Defeat. National Will -2. Uh oh. This would
be incredibly ironic if I lost this game on battles alone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>21</code> Central Powers Meddling in Afghanistan.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>16</code> Suvla Landing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>35</code> Provisional Government Takes Charge. Causasus now flipped to 1.
Acquire resource marker. I need to get some victories. Other than that,
not looking bad at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>07</code> Turkish Minelaying. This is a cool card, haven't seen it
before. This means I need to consider holding 1 mine back to spend that
action elsewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>18</code> Bulgaria Joins the Central Powers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11</code> Gallipolli Landings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27</code> Mesopotamian Siege. Getting a bit tougher now. Really starting
to worry about those battles. I just figured out why I'm doing so
well: I have not been moving the Sinai Front. Had I been moving the
Sinai Front, I probably would have lost the game by now. Bummer. I'll
start moving it from here on out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>25</code> Erzurum Offensive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>26</code> Verdun. Victory. Things are looking up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>22</code> Fortification of Gaza Beersheba. No luck on fronts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12</code> Gorlice Tarnow. Defeat. It's not looking good here. If I don't
make the offensives, this is the game! Pushed Caucasus back, National
Will -2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13</code> Italy Joins the War. Defeat. National Will -3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>05</code> Ghadar Conspiracy. National Will -3, but I've beat my first
game, except for not moving Sinai.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>33</code> Yudenich Named Commander in Chief. Bummer, this is going to make
Caucasus really hard to beat. National Will -5 game over. Crushing
Defeat!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
