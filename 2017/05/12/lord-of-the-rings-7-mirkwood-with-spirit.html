Lord of the Rings 7 - Mirkwood with Spirit
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 12 2017</time>
<p>As the title states, playing the Mirkwood scenario with only the Spirit
deck, and on the Easy setting.</p>

<p>On first glance, this looks like a tough deck to play, as there is not
much combat, and few allies. There is pretty good quest though, so will
have to concentrate on that.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 3</li>
  <li>Planning: Attach Favor of the Lady to Eowyn for 2 R, Power in the
Earth to Old Forest Road for 1. Resources 0 now, bummer.</li>
  <li>Quest phase: everyone, kind of risky, but could pay off well. Will is
4 Eowyn + 1 Favor + 1 discard + 1 Eleanor + 1 Dunhere for 8. This
seems ok because Forest Spider Threat is 25, and we're starting with
24, so it won't come out until next round. Mountains of Mirkwood
comes up for 2 threat, so, net 4 Q.</li>
  <li>Travel to Mountains of Mirkwood, Treachery deals 1 D to everyone, but
at least there is no T revealed.</li>
  <li>Engagement, nothing.</li>
  <li>Attack, nothing.</li>
  <li>Refresh.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource, gain 3 for 3.</li>
  <li>Planning, nothing this round.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 5 total, we'll try to stay even this round and get
Gandalf into play next round. Draw Forest Gate, which is good, can get
two cards going there. Net 1 P on Mountains.</li>
  <li>Travel, still at Mountains.</li>
  <li>Engagement, Forest Spider comes down, Eleanor will defend, takes 2 D
and is killed. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Attack: Dunhere, does 1 D on Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not looking super great, didn't get much progress last turn.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 2 for 5.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gandalf comes out for 5 R, will deal 4 damage to Forest
Spider, just get that creep out of the way.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn and Dunhere for 6, draw Dol Goldur Orcs for 4 T total,
net 2, Mountains cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: Forest Gate, draw 2 cards.</li>
  <li>Engagement, Dol Goldur Orcs, Gandalf defends.</li>
  <li>Attack, nothing.</li>
  <li>Refresh.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 2 for 2.</li>
  <li>Planning, nothing.</li>
  <li>Quest: this is going to be a tough one, and probably where the game
is decided. I'm only at 27 Threat, with nothing in the Staging area,
so I can afford to not quest this round, and build some resources.
Draw Treachery for 1 T in staging, lucky, net +1 T.</li>
  <li>Travel, at Forest Gate.</li>
  <li>Engagement: Eowyn defends takes 1 D.</li>
  <li>Attack: Dunhere takes care of the Orcs.</li>
  <li>Refresh.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<p>How far can we go here? I need to get a lot more resources, but I also
need to protect the Heroes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 2 for 4.</li>
  <li>Planning: Northern Tracker for 4, really need to have the defense
here.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 5 Q, draw Forest Spider for 2 T, Eowyn discard for +
1, net 4 and Forest Gate is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel, no place to go.</li>
  <li>Engagement, Forest Spider, Shadow forces Favor attachement discard,
bummer. Northern Tracker defends, no damage.</li>
  <li>Attack, Dunhere, 1 D.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 30, still doing pretty good if I can keep the Heroes
alive. Need to fish Eleanor back out of the discard.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 2 for 2.</li>
  <li>Planning: Spend 1 for Dwarven Tomb, return Eleanor to play. This is
probably not legal, but reading the card literally it's allowed.
Other cards cost 5 to get a hero back into play. I'll read up on
this deck later.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn and Dunhere with discard for 6, draw Dol Goldur
Beastmaster, sucks. Net 4 and Flies and Spiders is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel, no place to go.</li>
  <li>Engagement: both defend, Dunhere for 0 D, Northern Tracker for 1 D,
very lucky on Beastmaster, neither shadow card had an effect!</li>
  <li>Attack, nothing, bummer.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 3 for 4.</li>
  <li>Planning: Save resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 4, draw Enchanted Stream for 2, net 2, A Fork in the
Road is cleared. Stage 3 is "Beorn's Path" and will need 10 Q to win.
Hopefully Ungoliant's Spawn will not appear, but I think it will.</li>
  <li>Travel: nothing.</li>
  <li>Engagement: Eleanor takes a 1 D hit from Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Attack: Dunhere puts 1 D on Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Gandalf comes back into play next turn. If I can get one or both enemies
cleared, and 4 P on the quest, I might be able to win this one. Really
depends on what comes out of the deck next.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 3 for 7.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gandalf for 5, save for 3 cost ally next turn. 4 D on
Beastmaster, it's done.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Dunhere and Gandalf for 9, draw Forest Gate, +1 for
discard, net 6. Getting there!</li>
  <li>Travel to Enchanted Stream, hope we don't stuck there.</li>
  <li>Engagement, Eleanor 0 D from Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Northern Tracker deals 1 D to Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 3 for 5.</li>
  <li>Planning: Attach Favor to Eowyn for 2 R.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 4 + 1, Dunhere + 1, draw East Bight Patrol, Eowyn
discard Lorien for + 1 net 2, Enchanted Stream is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: Forest Gate, pick up two cards.</li>
  <li>Engagement, East Bight deals 1 D to Northern Tracker. Next round will
need to not quest I think.</li>
  <li>Attack: nothing.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 3 for 6.</li>
  <li>Planning: Lorien guide for 3. Weak card, total road kill here,
hopefully buys me another round to get a load of quest points. Also
play Wandering Took for 2.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn 5 + 1 discard + 1 Dunhere, draw Great Forest Web, net 4,
clears Forest Gate. Need to make some progress on quest card, need 5
more P to win it. And UG Spawn probably about to appear.</li>
  <li>Engagement: Eleanor defend Forest Spider for 0 D, Northern Tracker
nets 1 D.</li>
  <li>Attack: 1 D on Forest Spider. Dammit.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 36. I think I'm going to need to kill off a hero to
get this won soon.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 3 for 4, draw Gandald, pity I don't enough to get him
in play, this would win it I think this round.</li>
  <li>Planning: nothing.</li>
  <li>Quest: 6 draw Mountains of Mirkwood, net 2 P on quest card. Good.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. Risky, but Gandalf will be coming in next turnâ€¦</li>
  <li>Engagement: Bight takes out Lorien.</li>
  <li>Attack: Took and Tracker on East Bight for net 2, killed.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37, this game is going slow!</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-12">Round 12</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: gain 3 for 7.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Gandalf for 3 card draw, play Wandering Took, 0 R,
need to win it this round or get super close, like 1 P.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn 4 + 1 Favor + 1 discard + 4 Gandald for 10, draw Dol
Goldur Orcs (2 D to Gandalf), total threat is 6, net 4, 11 P on
quest card, and that's the game if I can get through the final stage.</li>
  <li>Travel: no need.</li>
  <li>Engagement: Eleanor defends on Forest Spider, Wandering Took on DG
Orcs, that's curtains for that Took. Shadow card exhausts the
other Took, and I have no resources to negate it.</li>
  <li>Attack: Dunhere takes the Forest Spider. Northern Tracker deals 2 D,
but need 3 D to kill.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38, booyah.</li>
</ol>

<p>That worked out pretty well. I could have probably won it a bit faster
had I allowed a little more threat to build.</p>

<p>Score: 164. Not very good I guess. Better to end with high Threat than a
large number of rounds. I don't really care much about score I don't
think.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Something I'm not really sure about: The card above which costs 1 and
gets a Hero out of discard and back into hand. I haven't seen anywhere
in the rules where that's prohibited, but it doesn't seem right. I
played it anyway. I may have been able to win this game without playing
that way, as long as the cards came up exactly how they did here.</p>

<p>I'll be on the lookout for an answer to this question.</p>

<p>For a next game, I really ought to play the full Encounter deck with
a mixed deck. Since there are 4 decks, and I can play two of them
together, there are 4 choose 2 combinations. 4 choose 2 is exactly 4!!,
which is 2 x 4 = 8. That's a bunch of games. And that's just for the
Mirkwood scenario.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
