Lord of the Rings 9 & 10 - Anduin horrors 2 & 3
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 17 2017</time>
<p>I just tried this <a href="https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/beorns-path-part-3-deck-tuning/">Leadership/Lore
deck</a>,
got to round three and lost Denethor on a 2 Dol
Goldurs followed byTreachery, which meant I couldn't deploy forest snare
with 2 resources, and with 2 hits on Aragorn, that's the game. Bummer.</p>

<p>This game never really got off the ground either. Round one questing saw
Theat 5 in the staging area, which was all the Will I had to commit, so
no progress whatsoever on the quest. My hunch is that if you can't knock
down or get very close to koncking down Stage 1 of the quest before
the Hill Troll comes out, it's going to be very, very difficult to win.</p>

<p>This game is starting to feel a lot like the States of Siege system,
where losing is absolutely expected most of the time, and winning really
is dependent on a lot of luck.</p>

<p>I plan on playing this same deck again, at least a few more times.</p>

<h3 id="game-10">Game 10</h3>

<p>This went half way through the first round, when Aragorn takes an
undefended attack from Wargs at +3, with shadow card dealing an
additional 3 for 6 total, Aragorn is dead not even through the first
round. Dang. That leaves the +3 wargs out, too.</p>

<p>Playing through the second round, only able to commit 1 to Quest, which
puts Threat at 33, which brings out the Hill Troll and 3 other enemies.
Only Denethor and Theodred are left, with 4 enemies including the Hill
Troll, with no damage on them whatsoever. Dang.</p>

<h3 id="game-105">Game 10.5</h3>

<p>Forget it.</p>

<p>My guess is that if the Hill Troll gets more than one attack, that's
pretty much the game, as the excess increases Threat by the excess.
The blog linked to above states it outright:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€¦cards like Forest Snare that are our only solution to certain, rather
large and hairy problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, without playing the Forest Snare right away, you're doomed.</p>

<p>This leads to the situation where a player might as well fold after the
third round Resource phase if the Forest Snare isn't in hand. Which is
kind of a waste time, as a player could simply mulligan, play a round,
if Forest Snare doesn't come up, quit and start a new game. Which leads
to the idea that maybe the player should pick a starting hand for this
scenario, or at least be allowed the Forest Snare at the start.</p>

<p>But that sort of obviates the whole premise of the scenario, where there
is this Hill Troll lurking in the staging area.</p>

<p>I don't think I'm sold on this scenario. The author of the play through
I read (linked to above) admitted outright the card draw was perfect for
winning the scenario. That's a lot of luck.</p>

<p>Not logging this play.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
