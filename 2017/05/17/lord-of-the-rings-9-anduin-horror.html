                Lord of the Rings 9 & 10 - Anduin horror
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 17 2017</time>
              <p>I just tried this <a href="https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/beorns-path-part-3-deck-tuning/">Leadership/Lore
              deck</a>,
              got to round three and lost Denethor on a 2 Dol
              Goldurs followed byTreachery, which meant I couldn't deploy forest snare
              with 2 resources, and with 2 hits on Aragorn, that's the game. Bummer.</p>
              
              <p>This game never really got off the ground either. Round one questing saw
              Theat 5 in the staging area, which was all the Will I had to commit, so
              no progress whatsoever on the quest. My hunch is that if you can't knock
              down or get very close to koncking down Stage 1 of the quest before
              the Hill Troll comes out, it's going to be very, very difficult to win.</p>
              
              <p>This game is starting to feel a lot like the States of Siege system,
              where losing is absolutely expected most of the time, and winning really
              is dependent on a lot of luck.</p>
              
              <p>I plan on playing this same deck again, at least a few more times.</p>
              
              <h3 id="game-10">Game 10</h3>
              
              <p>This went half way through the first round, when Aragorn takes an
              undefended attack from Wargs at +3, with shadow card dealing an
              additional 3 for 6 total, Aragorn is dead not even through the first
              round. Dang. That leaves the +3 wargs out, too.</p>
              
              <p>Playing through the second round, only able to commit 1 to Quest, which
              puts Threat at 33, which brings out the Hill Troll and 3 other enemies.
              Only Denethor and Theodred are left, with 4 enemies including the Hill
              Troll, with no damage on them whatsoever. Dang.</p>
              
              <h3 id="game-105">Game 10.5</h3>
              
              <p>Forget it.</p>
              
              <p>My guess is that if the Hill Troll gets more than one attack, that's
              pretty much the game, as the excess increases Threat by the excess.
              The blog linked to above states it outright:</p>
              
              <blockquote>
                <p>â€¦cards like Forest Snare that are our only solution to certain, rather
              large and hairy problems.</p>
              </blockquote>
              
              <p>Basically, without playing the Forest Snare right away, you're doomed.</p>
              
              <p>This leads to the situation where a player might as well fold after the
              third round Resource phase if the Forest Snare isn't in hand. Which is
              kind of a waste time, as a player could simply mulligan, play a round,
              if Forest Snare doesn't come up, quit and start a new game. Which leads
              to the idea that maybe the player should pick a starting hand for this
              scenario, or at least be allowed the Forest Snare at the start.</p>
              
              <p>But that sort of obviates the whole premise of the scenario, where there
              is this Hill Troll lurking in the staging area.</p>
              
              <p>I don't think I'm sold on this scenario. The author of the play through
              I read (linked to above) admitted outright the card draw was perfect for
              winning the scenario. That's a lot of luck.</p>
              
              <p>Not logging this play.</p>

              <h3>
                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
