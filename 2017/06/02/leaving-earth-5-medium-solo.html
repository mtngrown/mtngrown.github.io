Leaving Earth 5 - medium solo
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun  2 2017</time>
<p>Some solo goodness, a Leaving Earth medium difficulty scenario. I'm
going to play this one out while getting other chores done. I used to do
that a lot and it worked.</p>

<p>Here are the missions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Medium: Venus survey for 6.</li>
  <li>Medium: Mercury Survey for for 7.</li>
  <li>Easy: Man to Earth orbit and back for 4.</li>
  <li>Easy: Reveal Mars location for 5.</li>
  <li>Easy: Man to space and back for 2.</li>
  <li>Easy: Working Probe/Capsule in space for 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm definitely going for the Mercury Survey, and using an Ion Thruster
to get there.</p>

<p><code>1956</code> Purchase Saturn Advancement and Saturn.</p>

<p><code>1957</code> Purchase Saturn, Soyuz Advancement.</p>

<p><code>1958</code> Purchase Probe, Surveying Advancement, Ion Thruster
Advancement, 2 Probes, Vostok Capsule.</p>

<p><code>1959</code> Purchase 2 Soyuz, Atlas.</p>

<p><code>1960</code> Fire Saturn with Soyuz and Probe to Lunar Survey, this is just to
get some cards turned. Saturn is success, Soyuz is success, this gets
Probe into Lunar Orbit, now to Surveyâ€¦ Success. Too bad there is no
mission for Lunar Survey. Microbes found.  I have $5 left over, what to
spend it on? Buy another Altas.</p>

<p><code>1961</code> Launch Saturn (Success) with Ion Thruster and Probe. Ion Thruster
is a Minor Failure, oops. Purchase another Ion Thruster.</p>

<p><code>1962</code> Launch Saturn (Success, Advancement is clear) with Ion Thruster
and Probe. Major Failure! Oh noes! Buy off the Failure and purchase 2
more Ion Thrusters. Those extra Probes I picked up are coming in handy
now.</p>

<p><code>1963</code> Purchase Rendezvous and two Probes and another Ion Thruster.</p>

<p><code>1964</code> Purchase Saturn, launch two Ion/Probes. Rendezvous attempt to
split spacecraft, Success. Minor failure on Ion Drive, scrapping the
Venus mission. This is 3 failures on Ion Thrusters. Dang. (<strong>Mistake:
I could have brought the Ion Thruster back to Earth for repair.</strong>)</p>

<p><code>1965</code> Purchase Saturn and Ion Thruster, and lets hope docking works.
Major Failure for Rendezvous! Crap! That's $47 tied up and useless.
Should have tested Rendezvous. I don't have any cash to remove the Major
Failure, it's going back into the Outcomes. Bummer. (<strong>As above, I could
have brought the damaged component back to Earth for repair.</strong>)</p>

<p><code>1966</code> I need to test and clear Rendezvous before going any further. In
fact, because it's necessary for separation, I think it's something I
need to start testing much earlier in the game. For now I'm going with
the "speed bump" variant of Rendezvous, just using a single outcome.
I launched a Saturn with 2 Junos, Rendezvous successful. Purchase
Saturn and Ion Thruster. 1 year remaining on Mars probe.
(<strong>Mistake here, cannot purchase components without the corresponding
advancement if such exists.</strong>)</p>

<p><code>1967</code> Purchase Ion Thruster &amp; Probes, launch, separate for Venus and
Mercury.  Put on trajectory for Inner Planets Transfer, both for 1 year
trip, place Time Markers.  Mars probe arrives next year. Purchase Soyuz
and Apollo Capsule.</p>

<p><code>1968</code>  Mars Probe arrives, seasonal growths of plant life, supplies
available. Purchase Reentry Advancement. Two Soyuz stages with a Vostok
capsule to test Soyuz and Reentry. Purchase Astronaut, Vladimir. Probes
in Inner Planet Transfer, continue to Venus and Mercury Fly-Bys, respectively.</p>

<p><code>1969</code> Vostok Reentry, Success. Purchase Saturn. Remove Time Markers
from Venus and Mars Fly Bys. Nothing at Mercury, Venus with Extreme Heat
and Pressure, would have destroyed a lander. Purchase Vostok and launch
both. Vostok Reentry for Major Failure, purchase for 5. Apollo stays in
Earth Orbit.</p>

<p><code>1970</code> Apollo Capsule destroyed on Reentry, purchased Major Failure for 5.</p>

<p>Nothing else I really want to do, I'm calling the game here.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I'm taking the score as 18 from the 3 survey successes.</p>

<p>Still questions with the Rendezvous: which components can be used to
test this? From the forums, pretty much any spacecraft.</p>

<p>Playing this solo doesn't have the same sort of urgency that playing
against others has.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
