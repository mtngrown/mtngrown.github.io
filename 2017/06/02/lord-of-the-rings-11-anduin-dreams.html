Lord of the Rings 11 - Anduin dreams (4)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun  2 2017</time>
<p>Let's make another attempt at Journey Along the Anduin. We'll be using
<a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/58937">Beorn's deck</a>, custom built for
this scenario using only the cards from a single core box.</p>

<p>The draw is good, I have Forest Snare and Sneak Attack in my hand right
out of the gate.</p>

<p>From the scenario, the initial Encounter is a Treachery which has no
effect, good luck!</p>

<p>The Hill Troll is out.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3 total, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: saving resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: All will commit. Theodred resource goes to Denethor for future
Forest Snare deployment. Aragorn spends 1 to ready, in case of
problems in the staging area. Draw Eastern Crows, surges for Evil
Storm which doesn't apply with Threat &lt; 35. Lucky. Net 2 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter phase: Crows and Troll come out at 30. Since I don't have
any healing on the board, leaving the Crows in for now, which may be
a mistake, but I don't want to take a hit on Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3 Lore, 3 Leadership, draw Self Preservation. I may have a
chance to beat this scenario! Self Preservation is a Lore card, so
I'm going to have to be very careful about playing it. Probably need
to get the Hill Troll out of the way first. Meantime, need to keep
boosting Denethor for resources. May play Steward of Gonder onto
Denethor in fact.</li>
  <li>Planning: Theodred spend 2 attach Steward of Gondor to Denethor.
Denethor exhaust Steward of Gondor (SoG) add 2 resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Commit all, Aragorn spends 1 to ready. Draw East Bight. Net 1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Aragorn engages Crows. No other engagement this turn.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn takes on the Crows. Shadow is Pursued by Shadow,
which since I have no allies deployed raises Theat by 3. Sucks, but
could be way worse. Aragorn -1, Crows eliminated. Threat 32.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Lore 6, Leadership 2, draw Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: Self Preservation to Aragorn, Denethor pays.
Exhaust to bring Aragorn to full strength.</li>
  <li>Quest: All quest, spend 1 to ready Aragorn. Another East Bight from
Encounter deck. No big deal, still net 1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: nope, not yet. East Bight is going to be a bitch to get
through, with 6 Progress required. Could be what costs the game
if it goes into location lock. We'll see. (Played this wrong, see Round
4 Travel below.)</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll rolls out, gets Forest Snare from Denethor
right away.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn for 3, Gandalf with Sneak attak for 4, -4 on Hill
Troll, a good start. If I can get an ally out next round to deal with
Hill troll, that would be good.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Leadership 3, Lore 3, that SoG card is paying off. Draw
Faramir, excellent, will really help get this questing going. I can't
get him into play this round though, will have to save some resources.</li>
  <li>Planning: Erebor Hammersmith, this gets Sneak Attack back into my
hand! Could I have planned that better? I don't think so. Denethor pays.</li>
  <li>Quest: Commit 3 Will, draw Gladden Fields, net -2 for Threat 36,
bummer. At least the Hill Troll is toast this turn.</li>
  <li>Travel: since there is no active location, I <em>must</em> travel to East
Bight which righteously blows. I played this wrong above, but I think
the net Progress will work out the same.</li>
  <li>Encounter: amazingly enough, no baddies coming along. Looking like an
imminent location lock though.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn for 3, Gandalf with Sneak Attack for 4, Erebor and
Denethor for 1 each, net +6 for 10 hits on Hill Troll. He's toast.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37, need to get Gandy out to reduce that Threat.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Leadership 6, Lore 4, draw Son of Arnor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Faramir, Play Gandalf for threat reductio, Threat 32.</li>
  <li>Quest: Everyone but Erebor, who's going to play the chump if
necessary. Draw Banks of the Anduin. Will 12, Threat 5, net 7 for
Progress removes East Bight, adds 1 to Quest card. Really was hoping for
a bit more. No enemies yet. Got a bad feeling about this…</li>
  <li>Travel: East Bight is mandatory.</li>
  <li>Encounter, none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Leadership 4, Lore 3, draw Miner of the Iron Hills. No idea
what to use this dude for, maybe for soaking off an attack?</li>
  <li>Planning: Play 2 Guards of the Citadel this will net me 4 Will with
Faramir in play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Will 11, Erebor stands for defense if necessary. Draw Misty
Mountain Goblins, net 5 Progress, dammit.</li>
  <li>Travel: already at East Bight.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Aragorn engages Goblins.</li>
  <li>Combat: Shadow card Dol Goldur Orcs, deal +3 undefended, this puts
Aragorn as 5 hits, will heal for net 3 hits. Not sure if this is kosher,
but I'll look it up later. If it's not, this would pretty much be the
game. Otherwise, Aragorn and Erebor dispose of Goblins.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Leadership 2, Lore 4, draw Snowborne Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play the Scout, that gets rid of current East Bight.</li>
  <li>Quest: Will 13, Draw Wargs for Threat 6, net 7, Stage 1 is complete.
Too bad I can't carry over progress tokens.</li>
  <li>Travel: Gladden Fields. Ugh. Should be able to motor through this on
the next round though.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Snowborne Scout defends! Brave lad!</li>
  <li>Combat: Shadow card is Hill Troll! No effect!
Snowborne Scout perishes! Brave lad! Aragorn Deals 2 hits, not enough,
Wargs go back to staging area. Dammit! I should have left a couple more
Allies active from the quest. However, Scout's Valiant Sacrifice yields
Another SoG and Daughter of the Nimrodel.  This is good. Now I just need
to be able to draw a few more cards.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 36 (Gladden Fields).</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Leadership 2, Lore 7, draw Miner of the Iron Hills. Hrmph.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Daughter and Miner from Lore, SoG and Son of Arnor
from Leadership. Son of Arnor engages Wargs immediately.</li>
  <li>Quest: Will 13, draw Despair, but there are no Progress on the
current Quest card! Lucky! Threat 1 for net 12, Gladden Fields is gone
for 3 VP, 9 Progress on Stage 2.</li>
  <li>Travel, Banks of the Anduin. This will go back onto the top of the
Encounter deck, which is good, I'll know what it is.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs Shadow, no problem, Son of Arnor is
already toast, poor dude.</li>
  <li>Son of Arnor perishes, Wargs are slain by Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35. Bummer, this attracts some Big Baddies.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, I need to be finding another Gandalf, Sneak Attack and
whatnot. I have 1 card left in my hand.</p>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Leadership 5, Lore 5, draw another Daughter of the
 Nimrodel. Good thing there is a lot of these daughters.</li>
  <li>Planning: play another Daughter, good for questing.</li>
  <li>Quest: Will 17 and let's hope no surge…draw Enchanted Stream.
Could be worse. Threat 2 for net 15, definitely overkill, but this
clears Stage 2 and puts Banks of the Anduin back on the top of the
Encounter deck. Stage 3: Reveal 2 encounter cards per player into the
staging area. Draw Enchanted Stream and Dol Goldur Orcs. Skip the Quest
Phase for the remainder of the game. Once no enemies in play, players
have won the game.</li>
  <li>Travel, no, why bother.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Engage Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Miner of Iron Hills defends, Shadow card no effect, Miner takes 1 hit.
Awesome, the defender lives! Aragorn deals the game winning blow!</li>
</ol>

<p>It's a win!</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Apparently, I forgot to expose 2 Encounter cards during Quest Phase in
Stage 2 in this game. I recall reading that, and recall thinking, "Dang,
that sucks" but from the writeup, I forgot to actually do it in
when playing. I'm ok with that I think, gives me an excuse to play the
scenario again. I'd put it out right now if I didn't have DAK 2 already
in play. In any case, I'm pretty sure I would have won the scenario
anyway. I had a pretty strong hand going into Stage 2. It might have
taken me an extra round or two.</p>

<p>I still maintain this would be extremely gnarly to win without having
Forest Snare available to bind the Hill Troll. The only defender capable
of dealing with the Troll is Aragorn, and then pretty much only once,
unless for some reason the daughters and Self Preservation are all in
play. So it could happen, but it would be tough.</p>

<p>Score: 118.</p>

<ul>
  <li>35 Threat</li>
  <li>0 (dead heroes)</li>
  <li>90 (10 x 9 rounds)</li>
  <li>0 (damage)</li>
  <li>-7 Hill Troll and Gladden Fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to play Son of Arnor? I think is pretty powerful. In this game it
moved Wargs from staging to engaged. The main question is whether Son of
Arnor is the defender, or can other Allies or Heroes choose to defend?</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
