<p>Trying <a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/58832">"Back to Basics"</a>,
a three sphere deck. It's 44 cards, but I may bump it with another For
Gondor! and a couple of Valiant Sacrifices.  I have no idea how this
will play, so let's get after it.</p>

<h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>

<p>Encounter deck: easy.</p>

<p>Draw:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Steward of Gondor</li>
  <li>Lore of Imladris</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think this is great, but it's not bad either. I'll go with it.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1 Leadership, 1 Lore, 1 Spirit, draw Test of Will.</li>
  <li>No spend, need to save to get Steward of Gondor played.</li>
  <li>Quest, Eowyn, Beravor commits for 6 Will, draw another Forest Spider, net 1
Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel, Old Forest Road, ready Beravor.</li>
  <li>Encounter, both spiders come out.</li>
  <li>Combat: Beravor, no Shadow, 2 defense means 1 hit with Forest Spider +1 attack.
no effect, Theodred Shadow discard 1 attachment, but I don't have any,
no effect, excellent, but takes 2 hits. The spiders don't get any
damage back, but we're doing ok so far I think.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2 Leadership, 2 Lore, 2 Spirit, draw Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Steward of Gondor, recoup the 2 resources. Play Snowbourn place
Progress on Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 4. Since there is nothing in Staging, we'll leave
Beravor open for card draw or defense. Draw Dol Goldur Orcs, Eowyn
spends 1 to cancel with Test of Will. Excellent, except they're coming
out to fight with Threat 10. Net 2 Progress, Old Forest Road is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel on Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Encounter, Dol Goldur Orcs engage as well.</li>
  <li>Combat, all defending:
  * Theodred: Shadow is +1, Theodred is eliminated.
  * Beravor: no effect.
  * Snowbourn: elmininated.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think that's probably the game, 2 heros, no allies, 3 resources total
right now, 3 enemies with no damage on the board. I'll take it another
round to see what happens.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2 Spirit, 3 Lore, draw Hennamarth Riversong.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Gandalf, deals +4 damage to a spider (<strong>Mistake, spider has
1 defense, should be 3 damage</strong>). No resources left.</li>
  <li>Quest, none, draw Ungoliant's Spawn, net -3 for Threat 31. Ungoliant
doesn't come out this turn. (<strong>Mistake, forgot to advance threat last
turn, should be 32.</strong>)</li>
  <li>Travel: no locations available.</li>
  <li>Encounter: all engaged.</li>
  <li>Combat:
  * Gandalf takes undefended, needs some luck hereâ€¦`shadow raises
threat by 3, crap. Gandalf takes 4 hits, deals 3 damage to spider.
  * Beravor defends, Shadow no effect, no damage.
  * Eowyn attacks Dol Goldur Orcs for the kill.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not going to make it. I don't have resources, or defense, Ungoliant will
kill whichever hero it engages, and it has 9 hit points.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1 Spirit, 1 Lore, draw For Gondor!</li>
  <li>Planning, play Stand and Fight to put Snowbourn back on the board.</li>
  <li>Quest, no questing this round, Eowyn has to fight. Draw Necromancer's
Pass, Threat to 39.  Dang.</li>
  <li>Travel: Necromancer's Pass, discard Henamarth Riversong and Lore of
Imladris, probably the best 2 cards left in my hand.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ungoliant comes out.</li>
  <li>Combat:
  * Ungoliant to Snowbourn, Shadow no effect, Snowbourn back to discard.
  * Eowyn defend on Forest Spider, Shadow,  none, Eowyn takes 1 hit,
Beravor finishes spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 40, dang.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm actually doing a little bit better than I thought, disregarding
the errors so far have been in my favor. If I won this one (as if), I
would definitely count it as a "polluted" win. Let's see how much
further I can get.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1 Spirit, 2 Lore, draw Will of the West.</li>
  <li>Planning: Stand and Fight for Snowbourn again.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 4 + 1 discard Will of the West for 5, draw Dol
Goldur Orcs, 2 damage to Eowyn as she cannot play the cancellation
from A Test of Will, she's out of the game, dead dead dead. Dammit.
This was a calculated risk which didn't pan out.</li>
  <li>Travel, already at Necromancer.</li>
  <li>Encounter, Dol Goldur Orcs engage.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn is toast, Beravor take 2 hits undefended, kills Dol
Goldur Orcs. Ungoliant has no damage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no way with 1 hero this scenario can be won, especially when
that hero has 3/4 damage already.</p>

<p>I'm calling this game here.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Not sold on this deck. It certainly is weak when run-of-the-mill enemies
appear. It has neither the questing nor the combat to make any progress.
I may try another run with it, not sure.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
