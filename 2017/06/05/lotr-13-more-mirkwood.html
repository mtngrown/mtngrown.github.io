<p>Another stab at Journey Through Mirkwood with
<a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/58832">"Back to Basics"</a>. This deck did
not perform well for me yesterday, but it's worth trying a few more
times to even out the initial draw, and get different encounters.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>Encounter deck in easy mode.</p>

<p>Initial draw:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke</li>
  <li>Guard of the Citadel</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
</ol>

<p>The big difference between this draw and yesterday's draw is the Sneak
Attack and Gandalf is going to help take down that Forest Spider right away.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1 Leadership, 1 Lore, 1 Spirit, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: Beravor exhausts to draw Snowbourn Scout and Forest Snare.
Pretty cool, should be able to get these both in play. Snowbourn Scout
goes into play, 1 Progress on Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn only for this round. Draw Necromancer's Pass, Threat 6
Will 5, Threat +1 to 28.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road, ready Beravor.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Snowbourn engages Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Forest Spider takes out Snowbourn. Gandalf and Sneak Attack
for 4 hits + Beravor 2 hits for 6 hits on 1 Defense and 4 damage, Forest
Spider is defeated.</li>
  <li>Refresh, Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2 Lore, 2 Spirit, 1 Leadership, draw Miner of the Iron
Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Stand and Fight for Snowbourn Scout, which puts another
Progress on Old Forest Road, and allows possible engage.</li>
  <li>Quest: Commit 7, draw East Bight Patrol with Threat 3 for 6 total,
net 1 Progress Old Forest Road is cleared. Resource to Beravor, who can
play Forest Snare next turn if necessary.</li>
  <li>Travel: Necromancer's Pass, discard Sneak Attack and Hasty Stroke =(
Man that sucks.</li>
  <li>Encounter: East Bight Patrol comes out, Snowbourn will engage.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn defends, Shadow to exhaust 1 character, but all are
exhausted, hence no effect. Snowbourn back to discard.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2 Spirit, 2 Leadership, 4 Lore, draw Gandalf, not really
what I need at the moment.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Guard of the Citadel spend 2 from Leadership.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn and Theodred for 5 + 1 Eowyn discard Miner of Iron
Hills, draw Forest Spider net 4 Progress Necromancer's Pass is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: None.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider comes out.</li>
  <li>Combat: Guard of the Citadel killed by East Bight Patrol, Beravor
takes 1 Damage from Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3 Spirit, 2 Leadership, 5 Lore, draw Will of the West.</li>
  <li>Planning: Beravor plays Forest Snare on spiders. Would have been nice
to have this for potential Ungoliath, but we need to get moving along
here for now. Eowyn plays Will of the West, so there is a possibility of
getting Sneak Attacks back, which we'll need. Beravor exhausts to draw
Northern Tracker and Snowborn Scout. Play Snowbourn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn and Theodred, discard Nothern Tracker, Will 6, draw Dol
Goldur Beastmaster, which stays in Staging for now. Net 4 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout back to discard courtesy of East Bight Patrol.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3 Lore, 3 Leadership, 3 Spirit, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: Stand and Fight for Snowbourn Scout, dude is really taking
it on the chin here. Beravor exhausts draw Snowbourn Scout and Gandalf
(!). Play second Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 4, draw Forest Spider which will engage net 0
Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scouts back to discard, Theodred lays a point of
damage on East Bight. Shadow destroys Forest Snare attachment, activates
previously ensnared Forest Spider, which puts 2 damage on Theodred and
Shadow raise threat by 4. This is probably the game. I don't see how I
can deal with 4 enemies next round when they have so little damage on
them.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3 Spirit, 3 Leadership, 4 Lore, draw Lore of Imladris.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Lore of Imladris to heal Theodred. Play Gandalf to get
rid of one of the Forest Spiders.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 4, draw Great Forest Web, net 0 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Great Forest Web, exhaust Theodred, this can't be helped,
there will be too much Threat in staging otherwise, and the current
Threat is already too high.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Beastmaster comes out.</li>
  <li>Combat: Beravor, Shadow exhausts Gandalf, which sucks as he won't be
able to deal any damage and goes to discard. That was a waste of 5
resources. Beravor takes 1 Damage. Gandalf Shadow adds 3, Gandalf
defeated, but would have been anyway, and the Beastmaster lives on.
Forest Spider on Theodred takes 3 Damage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't any way to pull this one out. I only have 3 cards in my hand, 2
of which are Gandalf, and 3 enemies with no damage engaged. Another
round puts one of the Gandalfs out, then I'm out of resources.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2 Spirit, 3 Leadership, 2 Lore, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Gandalf and Guard. Would like to play Beravor for a
couple of card draws, but too many enemies.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 4, draw Dol Goldur Orcs, 2 Damage to Eowyn, net 2
Progress and Great Forest Web is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Guard of the Citadel killed. Beravor defends from Dol Goldur
Orcs, Theodred killed by Beastmaster, Gandalf deals 3 Damage to
Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think it's pretty much over now. I may make it through next round, but
I doubt I'll see Round 10. But whatever, best to play it out and see
what happens.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1 Spirit, 1 Leadership, 1 Lore, draw For Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn discard For Gondor, Will 5 draw Enchanted Stream, net 3
"Flies and Spiders" Stage 1 is done.</li>
  <li>Travel: let's leave Enchanted Stream in the Staging Area for now.</li>
  <li>Encounter, none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Beravor defends against Beastmaster, both Shadow cards are no
effect (!), undefended against Dol Goldur Orcs, Beravor is dead.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<p>I made it through this round, but there is no way Eowyn will survive 2
enemies on her own in the next round, so I'm calling this one here.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
