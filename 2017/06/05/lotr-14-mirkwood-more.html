LotR 14 - Mirkwood 10
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun  5 2017</time>
<p>This is my third attempt with this deck. The first attempt got me 5
rounds, the second 8 rounds.</p>

<p>In this game, if I can get to 9 rounds (or win), or get through the
second Stage of the Quest, I'll probably try it again. It would help
if I drew Faramir and was able to play him. Otherwise I'm thinking
this deck may not be for me.</p>

<p>Let's see what happens.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>Encounter deck in easy mode.</p>

<p>Initial draw, 2 Gandalf, nope.</p>

<p>Mulligan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Galadhrin's Greetings</li>
  <li>Will of the West</li>
  <li>Forest Snare</li>
  <li>Lore of Imladris</li>
  <li>Gleowine</li>
  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1 each, draw Will of the West.</li>
  <li>Planning: Beravor exhaust to draw Hasty Stroke and Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn 4 + 1 with second Will of the West discarded.
Draw Great Forest Web, net 0 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road, ready Beravor.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Beravor defends, Shadow is none, no Damage, Theodred attacks
to deal 1 Damage to Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2 Lore, 2 Leadership, 2 Spirit, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: Attach Steward of Gondor on Beravor, exhaust for 2
resources. Play Erebor Hammersmith for 2. Take a risk and exhaust
Beravor to draw 2 more cards, Miner of the Iron Hills and Guard of the
Citadel. Not great, but ok. The risk is losing Erebor, let's see what
happens.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn + 1 discard Miner of Iron Hills for 5, draw DOl Goldur
Orcs, 2 Damage to Eowyn. Net 1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: already on Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs come out.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dol Goldur Orcs deal 2 Damage to Erebor. Forest Spider deal 1
Damage to Theodred.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4 Spirit, 1 Leadership, 5 Lore, draw Lore of Imladris.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Lore of Imladris on Eowyn, and on Erebor.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 4, draw King Spider, net 0 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: on Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Encounter: King Spider comes out. Now have 3 enemies.</li>
  <li>Combat: all will defend, Dol Goldur Orcs 1 Damage on Erebor, King
Spider Shadow removes Steward of Gondor from Beravor, which is a
game-losing so Eowyn plays Hasty Stroke to cancel it, Beravor takes 1
Damage. Theodred takes another damage for 2 total.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<p>Too many enemies out. Time to deploy Forest Snare.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3 Spirit, 2 Leadership, 4 Lore, draw Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Guard of the Citadel. Stand and Fight for Miner of the
Iron Hills. Play Forest Snare on King Spider.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred 5 Will, draw Black Forest Bats, Theodred loses
Quest will, net 1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Still at Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Black Forest Bats come out.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dol Goldur on Miner of Iron Hiills, Shadow deals extra hit,
Miner is dead. Fuck. Balck Forest Bats no effect on Erebor. Guard of
Citadel deals 1 Damafe to Dol Goldur Orcs. Forest Spider does no damage
to Beravor. If I could clean out some of these enemies, I could quest
pretty well at this point.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'll get the Round 5 no problem. So many enemies with no way to handle
them, and not making any progress on Quest.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2 Spirit, 2 Leadership, 4 Lore, draw Gleowine.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play both Gleowine and draw 2 cards Gandalf and Northern
Tracker. Not that useful. Need attachment power here. Can't play Gandalf
this turn, not enough Resource.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 4, draw East Bight Patrol. Ok, that's probably the
game, very hard to get around these fuckers as they hit for 3. Threat
goes +1.</li>
  <li>Travel: still at Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Encounter: East Bight Patrol comes out.</li>
  <li>Combat: East Bight Patrol Shadow to exhaust 1 character, but all are
already exhausted in defending. Dol Goldur Orcs Shadow raises Threat by
4 to 35, Erebor takes another Damage. Forest Spider no effect on
Beravor. Black Forest Bats on Theodred Shadow remove attachment, Steward
of Gondor to discard, no Damage on Theodred. The hole is now too deep.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<p>I'm not quite par for the last game, as at this point I had ~6 Progress
on the Stage 1. At the moment, I have no progress on Stage 1, and
5 enemies engaged, with no way to really kill any of them. I just keep
getting attritted away as more enemies appear.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4 Spirit,  3 Leadership, 1 Lore, draw Steward of Gondor(!).</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Steward of Gondor on Beravor, exhaust for 2 resource.
Exhaust Gleowine for 2 draw Lore of Imladris and Snowbourn Scout. Play
Snowbourn, clear Old Forest Road. Play Gandalf to get rid of Forest
Spider. If I can get 1 more enemy removed this turnâ€¦</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 4, draw Necromancer's Pass, net +1 Threat for 37.</li>
  <li>Travel. Can't afford the hit, will risk the Threat.</li>
  <li>Encounter, nothing.</li>
  <li>Combat: East Bight Patrol kills Snowbourn. Black Forest Bats no
effect on Erebor. Dol Goldur on Beravor. Shadow is discard attachment,
Steward of Gondor again. Dammit. Beravor takes no Damage. Gandalf
handles Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2 Spirit, 1 Leadership, 1 Lore, draw Test of Will.</li>
  <li>PLanning: spending nothing this turn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn and both Gleowin for 6, draw Forest Spider net 1 Threat
for 39. Fuck.</li>
  <li>Travel: Can't afford the discards this turn.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider engages.</li>
  <li>Combat: Once again, 3 enemies, 3 defenders, can't get ahead. East
Bight Shadow exhaust 1 character, but all already exhausted for
defending, irrelevant, but Erebor is dead, so we're right back in the
hole. Forest Spider on Beravor, no Shadow, no effect. Black Forest Bats
on Theodred, no Shadow no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to get at least 1 further round than last game, but I'm still
super far behind on Progress, and my threat is already even, and I'm
resource constrained.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3 Spirit, 2 Leadership, 2 Lore, draw Erebor Hammersmith.
I can work with this.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Erebor, risk Theodred one more turn, otherwise Eowyn
has to fight, and we'd be near 50 Threat in no time. Actually, playing
Galadhrim's Greetings to reduce to 34 Threat.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, both Gleowines for 6, draw Ungoliant's Spawn. And
that's the game. I may get a round or two more, but there is no way I
can survive that. Threat back to 36.</li>
  <li>Travel: Will have to travel. Discard Will of the West and Northern
Tracker for Necromancer's Pass.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ungoliant Spawn.</li>
  <li>Combat: Ungoliant Spawn on Erebor, Shadow is discard Attachment, so
the other Forest Spider loses Forest Snare, now we have 5 enemies
engaged. Beravor takes 1 Damage from East Bight Patrol. Theodred takes 2
hits for 4 Damage total, he's dead. Black Forest Bats fo 1 Damage to
Eowyn, King Spider does 3 Damage, Eowyn is dead. This leaves Beravor
facing 5 enemies none of which have any damage.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this deck kind of sucks. It's certainly not an easy deck, given
how I smashed the scenario with both Leadership and Spirit monodecks.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
