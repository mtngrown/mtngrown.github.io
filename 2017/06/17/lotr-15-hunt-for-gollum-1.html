</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 17 2017</time>
<p>Here's <a href="https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135547-the-hunt-for-gollum-the-conflict-at-the-carrock-solo-play-progression-series-style/">the
deck</a></p>

<p>Aragorn, Theodred, Eowyn ( Starting Threat - 29)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Northern Tracker x3,</li>
  <li>Gandalf x3,</li>
  <li>Faramir x3,</li>
  <li>Guard of the Citadel x3,</li>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout x3,</li>
  <li>Lorien Guide x3,</li>
  <li>Westfold Horsebreaker x3,</li>
  <li>Steward of Gondor x3,</li>
  <li>Celebrian's Stone x2,</li>
  <li>Unexpected Courage x2,</li>
  <li>Dunedain Mark x3,</li>
  <li>Ever Vigilant x3,</li>
  <li>A Test of Will x3,</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke x3,</li>
  <li>Grim Resolve x2,</li>
  <li>The Galadhrim's Greeting x3,</li>
  <li>Dwarven Tomb x2</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack x3</li>
</ul>

<p>This deck only has Westfold Horse-Breaker and Dunedain Mark from the
"Hunt for Gollum" expansion. The deck's creator asserts he won with the
deck more than once. Let's give it a try.</p>

<p>I've also <a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/60764">entered this deck on
RingsDB</a>.</p>

<p>Starting hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
  <li>Ever Vigilant</li>
  <li>Celebrian's Stone</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
</ol>

<p>Quest setup commands an Encounter card, The West Bank revealed.</p>

<p>Playing this first game on Easy mode.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 1, Leadership 2, draw Grim Resolve</li>
  <li>Planning: Attach Celebrians Stone to Eowyn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 6, Theodred for 1, risky if we get surge. Draw Eaves
of Mirkwood. Net 2 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: The West Bank, induces 1 Resource penalty on Attachment play.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 2, Leadership 3, draw Ever Vigilant.</li>
  <li>Planning: none. I need Ally cards badly. I'm betting the shuffle is
completely against me.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn for 6 Theodred for 1, draw The East Bank, net 2
Progress. Without getting a questing Ally into play next turn, this game
is going into location lock as I won't be able to clear them faster than
the Threat is going up.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Location lock is imminent.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 3, Leadership 6, draw Lorien Guide, excellent, this
will clear The West Bank.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Lorien Guide. Sadly, this runs Spirit out of
Resources, which could be ugly if an enemy appears this round.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred and Lorien Guide. Add 1 R to Eowyn, 1 Progress
to The West Bank, clearing it, draw Goblintown Scavengers, which
discards Steward of Gondor, which increases its Threat to 3. Fuck. Net 0
Progress. I don't want to cancel that as I may need to cancel Shadow
Effects instead. Crap, I forgot I could spend a resource to ready
Aragorn from Quest, so, net 2P.</li>
  <li>Travel: The East Bank, which induces 1R penalty on Ally cards, but I
should be good for that for now.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblintown Scavenger.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends, no shadow. Should have taken this as
Undefended, and canceled Shadow Effect. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 2, Leadership 7, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn 6, Aragorn 2, Theodred 1, Lorien 1 for 10 total, draw
Gladden Fields net 5P which clears The East Bank and Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: Gladden Fields. I think I can handle the additional Threat.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Scavengers already engaged.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defending from Goblin, no effect these dudes
are weak sauce. Aragorn smites with 3 Damage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34, Gladden Fields, ugh.</li>
</ol>

<p>This quest is rolling.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 4, Leadership 5, draw Galadhrim's Greeting.</li>
  <li>Planning: I need Allies! Play Unexpected Courage on Theodred.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn 6, Aragorn 2, Theodred 1, Lorien Guide 1, draw Misty
Mountain Goblins. Net 6P, Gladden Fields cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: Eaves of Mirkwood, Encounter card penalty applies.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Misty Mountain Goblins.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends, which is a bummer, as I was hoping
to get a Faramir into play to get some Quest points on this dude. No
Shadow, Scout is minced. Ready Theodred with Unexpected Courage, Aragorn
by Spending 1R, deal 5 hits for 4 Damage, Goblins are toast.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 33 Threat.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 4, Leadership 6, draw Lorien Guide, sweet, this will
clear The Eaves of Mirkwood.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Lorien Guide.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn 6, Aragorn 2, Theodred 1, Lorien Guides 2, examine Banks
of the Anduin and Misty Mountain Goblins, keep Banks so to help
control the top of the Encounter deck. Net 10 P, Stage 2 clearedâ€¦but
it resets! I don't have a clue attached to any heros. Bummer. But no big
deal as I'm getting some pretty major questing action now.</li>
  <li>Travel: Banks of the Anduin. I've outsmarted myself, I need to cycle
through the Encounter deck rapidly, but Banks will slow me down.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 3, Leadership 8, draw Gandalf. Hrmph.</li>
  <li>Planning: Everything but Gandalf is Event. I'll wait to play him.</li>
  <li>Quest: 11 Will, draw False Lead and Hunters From Mordor, keep the
False Lead for the surge as no clue cards in play. Draw Flooding and
remove 2P from Banks of the Anduin, surge River Ninglor. I got this,
net 9P and Banks of the Anduin go back to the top of the Encounter deck.
I may discard it next round to get rid of it, not so bad after all.</li>
  <li>Travel: River Ninglor.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 35 Threat.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 4, Leadership 10, draw Dunedain Mark.</li>
  <li>Planning: Attach Dunedain Mark to Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn 6, Theodred 1, Lorien Guides 2, draw Banks of the Anduin
and Flooding. Keep Flooding, remove progress from Ninglor, surge
Eastern Crows, surge Evil Storm, cancel that bad boy with A Test of Will.
Net 8P, clear River Ninglor and Stage 2 (again), and reset.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Eastern Crows.</li>
  <li>Combat: Unexpected Courage to ready Theodred, Aragorn does the
honors, then we shuffle this back in.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 6, Leadership 13, draw Faramir, excellent!</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Faramir.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn 6, Aragorn 2, Theodred 1, Lorien Guides 2, Faramir adds
for 15, draw Signs of Gollum and Old Wive's Tales, keep Signs of
Gollum. Quest actually clears Stage 2, but Signs of Gollum doesn't
attach until after the Quest is successful, hence Stage 2 resets again.
Signs of Gollum attached to Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 6, Leadership 10, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn 6, Aragorn 2, Theodred 1, Lorien 2, Guard 1, Faramir
adds 6 for 18, draw Evil Storm and Treacherous Fog. Keep Treacherous
Fog and discard an Ever Vigilant. Stage 2 is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 38.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm pretty sure I can beat this next round.</p>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Spirit 7, Leadership 10, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Galadhrim's Greeting to reduce Threat to 32.
Play Gandalf, reduce Threat to 27.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn 6, Aragorn 2, Theodred 1, Lorien Guides 2, Gandalf 4,
Guard of the Citadel 1, Faramir 7, draw Eastern Crows and Misty
Mountain Goblins, keep Goblins. Net 21P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblins.</li>
  <li>Combat: Ever Vigilent to Ready Gandalf, who defends, no Shadow.
Unexpected Courage to Ready Theodred, 1R to ready Aragorn, 6 hits for
net 5 Damage and the Goblin been done smoted.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 28 Threat.</li>
</ol>

<p>That was pretty easy. I'll play it again on Normal mode. This would be a
good deck for Mirkwood as well.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Score:</p>

<ol>
  <li>11 rounds for 110.</li>
  <li>Damage 0.</li>
  <li>Threat 28.</li>
  <li>Dead Heros: 0</li>
  <li>Victory Points: 0</li>
</ol>

<p>Total: 138. Not too bad. Had I been paying more attention to clue cards,
I probably could have gotten this under 100.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
