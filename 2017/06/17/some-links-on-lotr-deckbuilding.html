Some links on LotR deckbuilding
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 17 2017</time>
<p>I'm super tired today, so just hanging out around the house mostly
reading some LotR forums. I've had pretty good luck with the game using
Leadership and Spirit decks, and combinations of Leadership and Spirit,
but not much luck with Tactics at all. Lore seems to work ok with
Leadership, not too well on its own.</p>

<p>At the moment, I'm working a 2 core set Leadership/Spirit deck, and
looking for information on building a Tactics/Lore (or Lore/Tactics)
deck. The two core sets means I'm able to provide 3 Gandalf for each
deck.</p>

<p>Spefically, I want to roll in Bilbo for Hunt for Gollum AP.</p>

<h2 id="spirit-and-spirittactics">Spirit and Spirit/Tactics</h2>

<p>Here's <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/6730889#6730889">link on
BGG</a> with a claim
that the 2d and 3rd scenarios can be beaten with base Spirit and Tactics
decks. That's a pretty bold claim for the 3rd scenario. I wish I knew
whether it was valid.</p>

<h2 id="escape-from-dol-goldur">Escape from Dol Goldur</h2>

<p>This person used a <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/6775096#6775096">four sphere deck from the core
set</a>. That's
pretty interesting, might well be worth a shot.</p>

<h2 id="tactics-mono-on-mirkwood">Tactics mono on Mirkwood</h2>

<p>According to this <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/650993/default-tactics-deck-impossible-win">thread on
BGG</a>,
it's definitely possible to win the Mirkwood scenario with a Tactics
deck from one core set. Given this information, I'm thinking that the 2
or 3 core set might well be workable.</p>

<p>Reading another thread, yet another new player crows about winning with
Tactics mono deck. Pretty lucky.</p>

<h2 id="stand-together">Stand Together</h2>

<p>"Stand Together" does not seem to be a popular card in many decks, but I
think it might have a good role in a Tactics mono deck. Here's some
<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/645457/stand-together-event-card">Stand Together
discussion</a>.</p>

<p>The way Stand Together works is by allowing several defenders to combine
their defense factor against a single enemy. The defenders still
exhaust. Any left over damage has to be dealt to a single defender.</p>

<p>In the Passage Through Mirkwood quest, this card could be the difference
between saving allies for another turn instead of using them as
meatshields. That could be incredibly useful in cases where the enemy
cannot be taken out in a single turn. I think this card is more useful
than people think, especially with enemies having low attack value where
the attacks can be completely defended against. I guess I'll see how it
works when I'm able to get it into play.</p>

<h2 id="threat-0">Threat 0?</h2>

<p>Somehow, this person is <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/660133/how-reach-0-threat-end-1st-scenario">claiming to be able to get Threat down to
0</a>.
That's quite a trick, and might be worth seeing if I can do the same.</p>

<h2 id="tricolor-deck-for-fast-cycling">Tricolor deck for fast cycling</h2>

<p>This sounds too good to believe, <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/6770616#6770616">cycling full deck nearly twice in a
game</a>.</p>

<p>I don't use card pulling well enough. It's probably worth it to do more
of it.</p>

<h4 id="single-hero-ledership-can-do-it">Single hero? Ledership can do it</h4>

<p>Same dude with the tricolor deck, here's the <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/663646/challenge-accepted-how-i-beat-mirkwood-solo-1-hero">session
report</a>.
A single hero can leave enemies in the staging area for a long time,
long enough to build up loads of useful allies. I'll have to play the
tricolor deck again more carefully.</p>

<h3 id="refresh-actions">Refresh Actions</h3>

<p>It turns out that there is an Event window at the end of the Refresh
Phase. Check out the <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/898901/just-random-combo">discussion on Gandalf and Word of Command
combo</a>.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
