LotR 18 - Passage Through Mirkwood 12
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 18 2017</time>
<p>Another crack at Mirkwood using a pure Tactics deck. This deck is the
same as yesterday's deck <a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/60809">listed
here</a>, with the addition of the
remaining Tactics cards "Rain of Arrows", "Stand Together" and "Thicket
of Spears." These are known to be pretty lame cards, at least in mixed
decks, but I may be able to work with them here.</p>

<p>Playing on Normal mode to reduce the effect of location lock.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dwarven Axe</li>
  <li>Blade Mastery</li>
  <li>Blade Mastery</li>
  <li>Rain of Arrows</li>
  <li>Blade of Gondolin</li>
  <li>Quick Strike</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to time this game to see how long it takes to complete.
It's 9:41 am, let's rock and roll.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Dwarven Axe.</li>
  <li>Planning: Sword of Gondolin on Legolas.</li>
  <li>Quest: All, draw Necromancer's Reach, 1D to everyone. Net 1P.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road, ready Legolas.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider comes out.</li>
  <li>Combat: undefended, Shadow none, +3 D to Gimli. Play Blade Mastery on
Legolas for 5 hits on Forest Spider, killed, +3 P on Old Forest Road,
cleared.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 30 Threat.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: Mistake here, Blade of Gondolin only adds +1 against Orcs. I could
have used Rain of Arrows here though.</p>

<p>Time: 9:47, ET: 6:08 minutes.</p>

<p>Gimli needs a Citadel Plate.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Dwarven Axe.</li>
  <li>Planning: nothing right now.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli and Thalin, draw King Spider, net +1 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: King Spider comes out. Legolas defends.</li>
  <li>Combat: play Quick Strike and Blade Mastery, Legolas kills
King Spider for +3 P. Three more to go and Stage 1 is clear.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 9:54, ET: 13:26.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: Dwarven Axe to Legolas.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Thalin, draw Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: play Feint, Forest Spider may not attack. Play Rain of Arrows
for 1D, deal 4 hits for +3 D, Forest Spider is toast and +3 P clears
"Flies and Spiders" Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 10:00, ET: 19:45.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Feint, excellent.</li>
  <li>Planning: Dwarven Axe on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Thalin, draw Necromancer's Pass. I don't have two cards
to discard for travel. Net 0 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: don't have the cards.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 10:03, ET: 22:33.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Swift Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning. none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli and Thalin, draw Necromancer's Pass again. Crap.
Threat 36.</li>
  <li>Travel. I think I'll hold.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 10:05, ET: 25:07.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Quick Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Thalin, draw Great Forest Web, looking like Location
Lock imminent. Threat 42.</li>
  <li>Travel: Exhaust Legolas for Travel.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 43.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 10:08, ET: 27:32.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Thalin, draw Forest Spider, Threat 47.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: play Feint and Quick Strike, Veteran Axehand and Legolas take
out Forest Spider, + 3 P, clears Great Forest Web.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 48.</li>
</ol>

<p>I need to draw Gandalf this next card, or game is over.</p>

<p>Time: 10:13, ET: 32:21.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Thicket of Spears.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it, game is over as I have 48 Threat, 4 available, and 6 in the
staging area. Even for 0 Threat Encounter I'm at 50 Threat.</p>

<p>Time: 10:17, ET: 36:13.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>First, the Elapsed Time (ET) for this game of 36:13 represents only the
sitting down and playing of the rounds from start to finish. There is a
certain amount of time for building the deck, setting up the game, and
getting this writeup started, the writeup finished, and the game logged.</p>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rounds: -80</li>
  <li>Threat: -50</li>
  <li>Heros: 0</li>
  <li>Victory points: 0</li>
  <li>Damage: -6</li>
  <li>Resources: +13</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: -123.</p>

<p>I think I'd like to actually win this scenario using Tactics before
moving on. With detailed notes would be worth a small post on BGG forum
I think.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
