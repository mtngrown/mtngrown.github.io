LotR 19 - Mirkwood 13
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 18 2017</time>
<p>Taking another stab at Passage Through Mirkwood using a <a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/60809">Tactics mono
deck</a>. I think I've been lucky on my
last two plays to get as far as I did. For example, Hummerhorns didn't
come out, and I was able to control enemies fairly well until getting
into location lock.</p>

<p>Here's another go at it.</p>

<p>Initial draw, after mulligan, doesn't look too good:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Horseback Archer</li>
  <li>Horseback Archer</li>
  <li>Quick Strike</li>
  <li>Thicket of Spears</li>
  <li>Dwarven Axe</li>
  <li>Blade Mastery</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:53 pm.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Blade of Gondolin.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Blade of Gondolin on Legolas.</li>
  <li>Quest: all, draw Eyes of the Forest, discard all Event cards, which
includes Quick Strike, Thicket of Swords and Blade Mastery. That
<em>really</em> hurts. Net 1P.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road, ready Legolas.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: undefended, need some luck here, Shadow none, 3 D on Gimli.
Legolas deals 2 D. Shit.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:58, ET: 4:57.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Horseback Archer.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Thalin, draw East Bight Patrol, net 0P</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: East Bight Patrol.</li>
  <li>Combat: Forest Spider 1 D on Horseback Archer. Play Feint on East
Bight Patrol, Legolas kills Forest Spider, Old Forest Road is cleared.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 3:06, ET: 12:28.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Thalin, draw Chieftain Ufthak, net 1P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: nothing new.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gondorian Spearman defends from East Bight Patrol, draw
Shadow none. Bye bye Spearman. Legolas kills East Bight, +3 P on the
first Stage.</li>
  <li>Refreash: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 3:12, ET: 18:14.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Quick Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Horseback Archer.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Thalin, draw Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Horseback archer defending (need no Shadow, let's get
lucky…) Shadow none. Legolas and the other Horseback Archer kill
Forest Spider, +3 P on Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 3:18, ET: 24:01.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Rain of Arrows.</li>
  <li>Planning: Dwarven Axe to Legolas.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin only, draw Dol Goldur Beastmaster. Dang. Threat 36.
I don't think this is winnable at this point.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur and Ufthak come out.</li>
  <li>Combat: Horseman Archers defend. Legolas and Gimli both for 5 on
Ufthak, sends him packing, and that's Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 3:26, ET: 33:06.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Blade of Gondolin.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Blade of Gondolin on Legolas.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Hummerhorns.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Thalin defends, take 1D. Dol Goldur sliced and diced
by Legolas and Gimli. Draw Beorn's Path for Stage 3. If I didn't have
Hummerhorns in play…</li>
  <li>Refresh: 38.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 3:35, ET: 41.48.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Dwarven Axe.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Dwarven Axe on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, draw Ungoliant's Spawn. Dammit. Just what I was hoping
not to happen. I might still be able to win it though, with some Gandalf
or Beorn, or locations. Threat 41. Crap.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ungoliant's and Hummerhorns.</li>
  <li>Combat: Legolas for Quick Strike on Hummerhorns, they're done.
Ungoliant Spawn undefended, Gimli deals 5 D.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 42.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 3:43, ET: 49:34.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resources: 10, draw Quick Strike!</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Necromancer's Reach, no effect.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ungoliant's spawn.</li>
  <li>Combat: Quick Strike from Legolas, deals 2 D, +4 P on Beorn's Path,
if only 1 more, would have this one won. Gimli defends, killed.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 43.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 3:29, ET: 55:57.</p>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Feint. If I get a location, I might be able to win it.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Great Forest Web, who cares?.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: all in.</li>
  <li>Combat: Legolas plays Feint, then attacks to kill Ungoliant for +4 P
on Beorn's Path. Just need 1 more…</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 46.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 3:53, ET: 59: 36.</p>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Beorn! Weep! If it were Gandalf, would be a clear win.</li>
  <li>Planning: I don't have enough mojo to play Beorn, else I would.</li>
  <li>Quest: none. Draw Forest Spider, Threat 50, that's the game!</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Undefended: Shadow, none, deals 1 D to Legolas, Legolas puts
the Forest Spider away to clear Beorn's Path.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 3:59, ET: 1:05</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I'm calling this one a draw at 50 Threat exactly while meeting the Victory
Conditions. If I had drawn "Don't Leave the Path" with the cards as
otherwise dealt, it would have been a win.</p>

<p>Huge mistake: I haven't been dealing damage to engaged enemies when
committing Thalin to quest. This a problem. I think this would have
mattered at least once, and possibly twice, and could have been the
difference between winning and losing.</p>

<p>The Tactic deck is subtle. Missing a beat anywhere is likely to affect
the outcome.</p>

<p>Both Citadel Plate and Blade of Gondolin seem pretty critical for
getting a win.</p>

<p>Let's score this beast:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rounds: 100</li>
  <li>Threat: 50</li>
  <li>Damage: 1</li>
  <li>Heros: 20</li>
  <li>
    <p>Victory Points: -9</p>
  </li>
  <li>Resources: 5 (resources should be counted!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: 162, or -157</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
