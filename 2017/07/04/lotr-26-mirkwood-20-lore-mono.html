LotR 26 - Mirkwood 20 (Lore mono)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  4 2017</time>
<p>Another attempt at Passage Through Mirkwood using a Lore mono deck this
one from a single core set. I'd sort of like to win this one, then move
on to Carrock and others in the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle.</p>

<p>If this Lore deck from a single core doesn't carry the day, I'll
probably build a two set again, as I was playing on previous attempts.</p>

<p>Here's the initial draw:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Secret Paths</li>
  <li>Radagast's Cunning</li>
  <li>Lore of Imladris</li>
  <li>Daughter of the Nimrodel</li>
  <li>Gleowine</li>
  <li>Lore of Imladris</li>
</ol>

<p>I'll take it.</p>

<p>Time: 10:06</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gleowine, pay 2.</li>
  <li>Quest: Glorfindel, Beravor and Gleowine for 6 W. Draw Necromancer's Reach,
damage to Gleowine, Beravor and Glorfindel. Play Radagast to neutralize Forest
Spider Threat. Net 5 P on Flies and Spiders.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road, ready Beravor.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends, Shadow is Chieftain Ufthak, no effect, and
very glad to get rid of him from the Enounter deck. Beravor attacks,
deals 1 D on Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 10:15</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, save up to play Gandalf to reduce threat.</li>
  <li>Quest: Beravor and Glorfindel for 5 W. Draw Necromancer's Pass.
Play Secret Paths to neutralize Threat. Net 5 P, clears Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Travel: Necromancer's Pass, randomly discard Gandalf and Daughter of
the Nimrodel. Ouch.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends against Forest Spider, Shadow is exhaust 1
character, which will be Gleowine. <strong>Note</strong> Had I used Gleowine in the
Quest, Stage 1 would have been cleared, but it might have resulted in
this attack being undefended. That probably would have been ok given I
have Lore of Imladris, and put the attack on Glorfindel.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 10:24.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<p>This is not my fastest playthrough, and it's going to get slower as I do
things like get the laundry done. But that's ok.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Dark Knowledge, usually a useless card, but since
I don't have a Gandalf now, and I do have a fair number of Resources, I
might just end up playing it.</li>
  <li>Planning: Erebor Hammersmith, pay 2 R.</li>
  <li>Quest: Glorfindel, Beravor and Denethor, just in case something burly
comes out of the Encounter deck, draw Enchanted Stream, net 4 P, cleared
Necromancer's Pass and Flies and Spiders. Exhaust Gleowine to draw
Lorien's Wealth. Not that useful with Enchanted Stream coming up.</li>
  <li>Travel: Enchanted Stream.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Erebor defends, Shadow is none, 1 D to Erebor.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 10:34</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Secret Paths. Excellent.</li>
  <li>Planning: Attach Dark Knowledge to Denethor, pay 1.</li>
  <li>Quest: Beravor, Gleowine and Glorfindel, draw Dol Goldur Beastmaster.
Net 4 P, clears Enchanted Stream and A Fork in the Road. Don't Leave the
Path is next up, will choose Ungoliant's Spawn as the spider.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: . DGB doesn't come out until Threat 35. Ungoliant's Spawn
comes out.</li>
  <li>Combat: Erebor defends, Shadow none, Erebor now 2 D. Denethor uses
Dark Knowledge on Ungoliant Shadow card: Exhaust 1 character. This puts
me in a bit of a bind, as Denethor was intending on defending, but he is
the last card standing, so if he's exhausted the attack is undefended
and I lose a hero for sure. I'll just do that.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 10:51</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Radagast's Cunning, this will nullify DGB, not that
it matters.</li>
  <li>Planning: pay 2 for healing Glorfindel. Pay 1 from Glorfindel to get
a hit point back for Erebor.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gleowine, try to reduce best as possible. Draw Black Forest
Bats. Gleowine removed from Quest. Threat up to 37, now 4 enemies going
to attack. Bad.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Black Forest Bats and Beastmaster come up. I can't win
this now. Losing Gandalf so early in the game was a stupendous blow
from which I wasn't able to recover.</li>
  <li>Combat: Glorfindel defends from Ungoliant's Spawn, Shadow +1,
Glorfindel dead. Beravor defends against Dol Goldur Beastmaster, no
Shadow, net 1 D. Erebor defends on Forest Spider, Shadow is Hummerhorns,
1 D to each character, Gleowine is dead, Forest Spider kills Erebor.
Black Forest bats undefended, 1 D on Beravor, dead. Game over.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 11:02</p>

<p>And I thought I was doing so well. I really needed some Gandalf and
Forest Snares. I think it's probably pretty hard to win with mono Lore
without having a couple of Forest Snares in play. As it turns out,
Forest Snare was at the top of my draw deck.</p>

<p>Score:</p>

<p>Rounds: -50
Heroes: -30
VP: 0
Threat: -34</p>

<p>Total: -114</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
