LotR 28 - Conflict at the Carrock 1
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  4 2017</time>
<p>First play of Conflict at the Carrock using one Beorn's Path <a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/732/beorn-s-path-5-conflict-at-the-carrock-leadership-lore-1.0">decks from
RingsDB</a>.
It looks like a pretty good deck, and the write up shows how it can win.
Perhaps after I manage to win at this scenario, I'll work on building
my own deck for the next scenario. Or perhaps build a Tactics/Spirit
deck for this one. There isn't much questing in this scenario, so having
Eowyn control that along with major Tactics combat might work well. But
I need to play through this deck first.</p>

<p>Time: 4:38 pm.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Valiant Sacrifice</li>
  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
  <li>Rivendell Minstrel</li>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>Dunedain Mark</li>
  <li>Son of Arnor</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think this is a very good starting hand, but I'll play it out
anyway to see how it works.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Song of Kings.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, need to accumulate resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: all, draw Muck Adder. Uh oh. Net 1 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Muck Added.</li>
  <li>Combat: undefended as all quested, Shadow is no defense allowed,
Denethor takes the hit and is discarded from play. That's probably the
game right there.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: I could have readied Aragorn, but with the Shadow effect, he would
have taken damage and left play. So there really wasn't any out of that
one. For Muck Adders, really need to engage with Allies.</p>

<p>Time: 4:45 pm.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn only, draw Wargs. Threat 31.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wargs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Theodred defends for Wargs, Shadow none, 2 D on Theodred.
Erebor is killed from Muck Adder. Dang. Aragorn spends 1 R to ready
and attack Muck Adders, they're gone.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: I could have drawn 2 cards with Ever Vigilant when Erebor left.</p>

<p>Time: 4:51 pm.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Dunedain Warning.</li>
  <li>Planning: Erebor Hammersmith, pay 2. Attach Dunedain Mark to
Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred and Aragorn, add 1 R to Aragorn, draw Sacked!, play
on Theodred. Ready Aragorn for 1 R. No net progress or threat.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Erebor defends against Wargs, Shadow none, 2 D on Erebor.
Aragorn swings with 4 on Wargs, they're done.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 4:58 pm.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Secret Paths, which I can't use, all of Lore is
dead to me in this deck.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, draw The East Bight. Threat 34.</li>
  <li>Travel: mandatory to East Bight.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. All hell is about to break loose though.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 5:02 pm.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn scout pay 1.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, draw Muck Adder. Ready Aragorn. Threat 36.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Muck Adder.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends from Muck Adder, Shadow says deal X
shadow cards to this attacker where X is the number of players.
Fortunately, X = 1 in this game. I'm calling it no effect. Snowbourn
Scout is dead, Ever Vigilant for 1 and draw Gandalf and For Gondor.
Not useful. Aragorn kills Muck Adder.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 5:07 pm.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2, draw Ever Vigilant.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, draw Hill Troll. Threat 38. Ready Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Combat: Hill Troll against Erebor defending, Shadow -1 defense for
Erebor, he's done. Spend 1 R Ever Vigilant to draw Guard of the Citadel
x 2. Aragorn attacks with 4, net 1 D on Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 5:12 pm.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2, draw Self Preservation.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: none.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Guard of the Citadel defends, Shadow none, Guard is dead.
Aragorn puts 1 more D on Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 5:14 pm.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1, draw Dunedain Mark.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Dunedain Mark on Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Banks of the Anduin, Threat 43.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: undefended, Theodred dead, Aragorn puts 2 D on Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 44.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1, draw Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Dunedain Warning on Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Gladden Fields, Threat 50. Game over.</li>
</ol>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rounds: -90</li>
  <li>Heroes: -20</li>
  <li>Threat: -50</li>
  <li>VP: 0</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: -160.</p>

<p>Not too bad given I lost Denethor on the first turn, and didn't draw
Steward of Gondor until Turn 9. Beorn's initial draws (I've noticed)
seem to "unusually" good for his play throughs. I could probably figure
out the odds.</p>

<p>Take home for this game: Don't go all in on questing on the first turn
unless there is an ally or two already out.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
