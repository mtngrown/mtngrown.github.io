LotR 29 - Conflict at the Carrock 2
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  5 2017</time>
<p>Second play of Conflict at the Carrock using one Beorn's Path <a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/732/beorn-s-path-5-conflict-at-the-carrock-leadership-lore-1.0">decks from
RingsDB</a>.
After yesterday's play I'm thinking this is a pretty good deck, but
as noted yesterday, Beorn always seems to have the optimal starting
hand on his play throughs. No big deal. His decks, his playthroughs, I'm
not quite there yet.</p>

<p>Let's see how fast I can knock this out. I need to be out the door by
10:30, which means I need a hard stop at 10:00.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>For Gondor!</li>
  <li>Gleowine</li>
  <li>Valiant Sacrifice</li>
  <li>Daughter of the Nimrodel</li>
</ol>

<p>I'll take it.</p>

<p>Time: 9:11</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Faramir</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gleowine pay 1.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gleowine, Theodred, Aragorn, draw Gladden Fields, Threat 29.</li>
  <li>Travel: Gladden Fields.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 9:14</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Secret Paths.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Faramir, pay 4.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Gleowine, Theodred, 1 R to Aragorn, Aragorn pays to
ready. Draw The East Bight. Net 4 P, Gladden Fields is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: East Bight.</li>
  <li>Encounter: None.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 9:17</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel pay 2.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gleowine, Aragorn, Theodred, Faramir, Denethor for 9, draw
Gladden Fields, play Secret Paths to cancel it, net 7 which clears
East Bight.</li>
  <li>Travel: Gladden Fields. This is driving my threat up badly, I'm going
to need Gandalf for Threat reduction right about now as the Troll are
going to kill me otherwise.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34. Troll country now.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 9:24</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw For Gondor1</li>
  <li>Planning: Daughter of the Nimrodel, pay 3.</li>
  <li>Quest: Daughter, Faramir (action), Aragorn, Theodred, Gleowine for 9,
draw Misty Mountain Goblins. Gladden Fields cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Misty Mountain Goblins.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends, Shadow none, no effect on Denethor, Aragorn
and Guard of Citadel attack with 4, goblins toast.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 9:31</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout pay 1. Gleowine exhausts to draw
Celebrian's Stone.</li>
  <li>Quest: Denethor scries, Hill Troll! To the bottom of the deck with
you, sir! Quest with Faramir, Aragorn and Theodred. Draw Wargs, net 1 P.
Ready Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wargs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Wargs has a nasty effect of going back to the Staging Area
if they don't get a Shadow effect. Fortunately (!) this one gets the
"Deal X Shadow" cards. Since it's only 1 player, I'm good and there is
no net effect. But Wargs stays out to get killed. First, Wargs kills
Snowbourn Scout. We'll spend 1 R from Denethor to discard Valiant
Sacrifice and draw Son of Arnor and Dunedain Warning. (Where is
Gandalf!) Aragorn and Guard of Citadel kill Wargs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 9:46</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Radagast's Cunning.</li>
  <li>Planning: Dunedain Warning to Aragorn. Gleowine to draw Secret Paths.
Denethor to scry, Muck Adder to bottom of deck.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn and Daughter, draw The Brown Lands. Play Secret Paths.
Net 1 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: Brown Lands</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 9:53</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Protector of Lorien.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gleowine to draw Henamarth Riversong. Play Henamarth,
exhausr to scry Roasted Slowly. We'll keep it.</li>
  <li>Quest: Faramir only, draw Roasted Slowly, net 0 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I don't draw Gandalf for reducing Threat on this next turn, I've
almost surely lost this game. I'll have to very carefully scry the
Encounter deck to ensure I don't clear Stage 1. This is going to get
tense. For now, I have to step aside to make a trip into the city.</p>

<p>Time: 9:58</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<p>Time: 1:32</p>

<p>This turn will take a while, a I just brewed up a moka and have a flan
for dessert.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Gandalf!</li>
  <li>Planning: First up is getting Gandalf out to play to drive down the
threat, using Sneak Attack. Threat down to 33. Second, Gleowine to draw
another Gandalf! Excellent! Henamarth to scry: Roasted Slowly, no
problem, leave that one as-is. Attach Protector of Lorien to Aragorn,
Denethor pays 1.</li>
  <li>Quest: Daughter and Guard and Faramir for 4, draw Roasted Slowly,
Grimbeorn's Quest is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Carrock.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none, Threat is 33.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 1:50</p>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Song of Kings.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gleowine to draw 3rd Gandalf. Dang. Henamarth scries Bee
Pastures, which is good, we'll get Grimbeorn at some point. Play
Gandalf, Threat 28.</li>
  <li>Quest: let's get through The Carrock, Gandalf, Aragorn, Daughter,
Faramir, Theodred, Guard for 13, more than enough, draw Bee Pastures, clear
The Carrock. Net 5 P on Against the Trolls.</li>
  <li>Travel: Bee Pastures. Grimbeorn is out.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Threat: 29.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:00</p>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Forest Snare.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gleowine draws Rivendell Minstrell. Henamarth scries River
Langflood, bad, Staging Area Threat will be 14. Song of Kings to
Denethor which should help get Beorn in play, so let's do that right
now, which puts me at 0 R. Can't be helped.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Theodred, Denethor, Daughter, Guard, Grimbeorn,
Faramir for 14, no net. Crap. That means I can't clear Bee Pastures and
River Langflood stays in Staging boosting Troll threat. This may be what
kills it for me. We'll see.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:13</p>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Dunedain Mark.</li>
  <li>Planning: Henaarth scries Oakwood Grove, will need 16 Will
to break even, don't have. Dammit. Going into Location Lock.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Gleowine, Daughter, Guard, Theodred, Denethor,
Faramir for 13, draw Oakwood Grove, Threat 33.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Stuart.</li>
  <li>Combat: Grimbeorn defends takes 1 D, puts 1 D on Troll.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:19</p>

<h4 id="round-12">Round 12</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Sneak Attack, excellent.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gandalf with Sneak Attack. Threat to 29. Henamarth
scries Hill Troll. Dang. That blows. I have to do 48 damage to get
through this game while dealing with 14+ Threat in the Staging Area.
River Langflood pretty much lost this game for me. I can play Forest
Snare on Stuart though, so let's do that.</li>
  <li>Quest with Gandalf, Aragorn, Theodred, Denethor, Gleowine, Daughter,
Faramir, Guard for 18. Ready Aragorn for 1. Threat 15, net 3 P Bee
Pasture is cleared. Whew.</li>
  <li>Travel: River Langflood, finally.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Combat: Grimbeorn defends, Shadow removes 1 P from
Quest, we have plenty, Grimbeorn takes 3 hits, deal 1 D. Sadly, Threat
is now 32.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:32</p>

<h4 id="round-13">Round 13</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Steward of Gondor. Excellent.</li>
  <li>Planning: Attach Steward of Gondor to Aragorn and exhaust. Gleowine
to draw Dunedain Mark. Henamarth scries Marsh Adder. Play Son of Arnor
and Rivendell Minstrel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Rivendell Minstrel, Aragorn, Daughter, Faramir for 8, draw
Marsh Adder, cannot negate, no Lore Resources. Crap, Threat 36 and it's
all over but the slaughtering. Had I added more to the Quest, I wouldn't
be able to kill the current Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Enounter: 4 Trolls engaged. I have no chance at winning this thing,
even though I may be able to go 2-3 more rounds.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends against Morris, Shadow -1 Defense Aragorn
takes 1 D. Theodred defends takes 4 D. Denethor defends, takes 2 D,
Grimbeorn defends, takes 3 D deals 1 D, Threat 39.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40. Marsh Adder comes out next turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:53</p>

<h4 id="round-14">Round 14</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Valiant Sacrifice, but I need a snare.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gleowine draws Snowbourn Scout. Henamarth scries Despair.
Play Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Rivendell Minstrel, Theodred, Daughter and Faramir for 5, draw Despair and
remove 4 P from Against the Trolls. Clear River Langford. Radagast's to
remove Marsh Adder threat.</li>
  <li>Travel: Oakwood Grove. Staging area now almost clear.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends, Shadow none, take 2 D. Denethor defends, no
Shadow takes 2 D. Grimbeorn defends against Rupert, takes 2 D, Threat
now 43. Snowbourn Scout defends Hill Troll, Threat now 49. Grimbeorn and
Guard of Citadel and Son or Arnor deal 4 D to Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Refresh: 50</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's the game.</p>

<p>Time: 3:09</p>

<p>Score:</p>

<p>Rounds: -140
Threat -50
Heroes: 0
VP 0</p>

<p>Total: -190</p>

<p>River Langflood on top of the Trolls was the game. I got behind right
there and there was no way to get past it in one turn. Had I been able
to quest with even a couple more points, I might have been able to do
it.</p>

<p>Major mistakes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Not using Steward of Gondor. It came out so late in the game I just
forgot about it. This would have let me get at least one more Gandalf in
play.</li>
  <li>Not using Celebrian's Stone. For whatever reason, I didn't think I
need the questing, until it was too late.</li>
</ol>

<p>I feel this one was pretty close, and that I got pretty lucky early on.
With better play, this hand and draw should have been winnable.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
