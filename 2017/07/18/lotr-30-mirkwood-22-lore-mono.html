LotR 30 - Passage Through Mirkwood (22) (Lore mono win)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul 18 2017</time>
<p>Playing this with a 38 card <a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/63952">pure core
lore (v1.1)</a> deck built from two sets.
I expect to use some of the cards as discards for boosting power and
card draw. If it works, I'll probably add a few more cards to the deck
such as Gandalf's Search expressly for discards.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Forest Snare</li>
  <li>Lorien's Waelth</li>
  <li>Lorien's Wealth</li>
  <li>Gleowine</li>
  <li>Lore of Imladris</li>
  <li>Self Preservation</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 1:28</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Erebor H.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gleowine.</li>
  <li>Quest: Glorfindel, Gleowine, Beravor, draw Eyes of the Forest, discard both
Lorien's Wealth and the Lore of Imladris from hand. That's brutal. Net 3
P on quest card.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road, ready Glorfindel.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends, draw Shadow for discard attachment, but
don't have any. Denethor takes no damage, Glorfindel deals 2 D on Forest
Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 1:39</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Self Preservation.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor. Denethor scries, finds Caught in a Web, to the
bottom of the deck with that.</li>
  <li>Quest: Beravor and Gleowin, draw Black Forest Bats, remove Gleowine
from quest, net 1 P on Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Black Forest Bats.</li>
  <li>Combat: Black Forest Bats undefended, draw Shadow, Glorfindel takes
one D. Erebor defends Forest Spider, draw Shadow, exhaust Glorfindel.
If I get another enemy from the deck next turn, this may cost me the
game. It has definitely added at least one turn to the game. Erebor
takes 1 D.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 1:47</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Lore of Imladris.</li>
  <li>Planning: I need more allies. Beravor will have to draw. Losing
two Lorien's Wealth really hurt. Beravor drawing is going to put me
another turn behind on the quest. Draw Miner of the Iron Hills and play
it.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gleowine, Erebor, draw Necromancer's Reach, deal 1 D to each
exhausted character, net 2 P on Old Forest Road which is now cleared.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends against Forest Spider, draw Shadow +1 for
hits, but no effect on Denethor. Glorfindel takes Black Forest Bats
undefendedâ€¦draw Shadow no effect, Lucky! Glorfindel kills Forest
Spider, Miner of Iron Hills kills Black Forest Bats.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not looking too bad, really. With a lucky card draw and quest, I could
get through Stage 1 next round.</p>

<p>Time: 1:57</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Beorn's Hospitality. Hrm.</li>
  <li>Planning: Denethor scries East Bight Patrol, to the bottom because
that card swings for 3 hits, and only Denethor could deal with it right
now.</li>
  <li>Quest: Beravor, Gleowine, Erebor, Glorfindel, draw Chieftain Ufthak.
Crap. Good thing I have a Forest Snare and enough resources to use it.
He doesn't come out until 35 Threat anyway, so I have another before
it's mandatory engagement. Flies and Spiders (Stage 1) is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. Would like to get some locations here. Seems like all
the plays I've been doing with Lore mono aren't drawing locations.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:05</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Lorien's Wealth.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Lorien's Wealth, draw Daughter of the Nimrodel, Dark
Knowledge, Miner of the Iron Hills. Not bad. Denethor scries Ungoliant's
Spawn. To the bottom of the deck! Self Preservation on GLorfindel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Beravor, Glorfindel, Erebor, Gleowine, draw Necromancer's
Pass. Good thing I quested with everyone, because that thing is 3
Threat. I'll have to discard 2 cards at random to travel there. If I
lose the Forest Snare, that would hurt, as I have to deal with
Ungoliant's Spawn at the same time. Dang. I have Ungoliant and Ufthak in
the Staging Area. Unless I draw some Gandalf, this is not going to go
well for me.</li>
  <li>Travel: Necromancer's Pass, discard Daughter of the Nimrodel and
Beorn's Hospitality. Lucky.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ungoliant.</li>
  <li>Combat: Miner of the Iron Hills defends, Shadow none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:30</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Daughter of the Nimrodel.</li>
  <li>Planning: Forest Snare on Ungoliant.</li>
  <li>Quest: Beravor and Miner, draw King Spider. That's bad news, and
probably the game. Again, no locations, always with the enemies. Threat
36.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ufthak and King Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Glorfindel defends Ufthak, Shadow Hummerhorns, deal 1 D to
each charactAer. Erebor is out, +2 D on Glorfindel. No damage on
Denethor.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:39</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Gandalf, like 1 round too late.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gandalf, takes out King Spider. Denethor scries Enchanted
Stream, Beravor draws Erebor and Secret Paths.</li>
  <li>Quest: commit nobody, draw Enchanted Stream, play Secret Paths on
that thing.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gleowine Defends (!?), draw Shadow to discard attachment,
none. Gleowine is toast. Deal 4 D on Ufthak from Gandalf and Glorfindel.
I have no allies out. If I get another enemy, I'm toast.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:48</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Erebor.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Dol Goldur Orcs, 2 D to Glorfindel, Self
Preservation to get those back. Threat 42. Can't win it. Maybe should
have put the Gandalf damage on Ungoliant and taken the hits elsewhere,
hard to say.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Erebor defends, Shadow draw no effect, Erebor dead.
Denethor defends, Shadow draw no effect. Beravor and Glorfindel kill
Ufthak.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 2:58</p>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Secret Paths.</li>
  <li>Planning: Erebor for 2.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Forest Gate, play Secret Paths Threat 44.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends, Shadow draw +1 attack, net 1 D to Denethor.
Erebor kills Dol Goldur Orcs. Glorfindel and Beravor put 3 D on
Ungoliant.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 3:03</p>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Henamarth.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Henamarth and Miner of Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, this will be the last round, draw Dol Goldur
Beastmaster. I think I got very lucky and won this one. Threat
is now 49.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Combat: Miner defends, Shadow double draw, no effect, Miner is dead.
Glorfindel, Beravor, Denethor, Erebor and Henamarth apply 8 hits to
Ungoliant, net 6 D, she is dead.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm calling this a win right here, as the rules say "If at least one
player survives through the <em>completion of the final stage of the
scenario</em>, the game ends in a victory for the players. (Emphasis mine.)</p>

<p>It does not say players must "survive until the end of the round with
Threat below 50." It might have could have said that, but it doesn't.
I'm taking this as very clean win. It was chancy there early going.</p>

<p>Score:</p>

<p>Rounds: 100
Threat: 49
VP: 4
Damage: 4</p>

<p>Total: 157.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
