LotR 31 - Carrock 3
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul 19 2017</time>
<p>Third play of Conflict at the Carrock using one Beorn's Path <a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/732/beorn-s-path-5-conflict-at-the-carrock-leadership-lore-1.0">decks from
RingsDB</a>.</p>

<p>Initial draw:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Forest Snare</li>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>For Gondor!</li>
  <li>A Burning Brand</li>
  <li>Forest Snare</li>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not a bad hand, normally, but we would want the Forest Snares in
hand later in the game given the upcoming Boss Fight. I'm going to play
it out and see what happens.</p>

<p>I'm taking time on this game, but I do need to do chores as well, so the
game play is going to stretch quite a bit. I may take time before the
rounds start as well as after the end of a round.</p>

<p>Time: 8:32</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Valiant Sacrifice.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Aragorn, draw Muck Adder (crap), no net progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Muck Adder.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends, draw Shadow none, no effect. Aragorn puts 3
D on Muck Adder.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 8:39</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Daughter of the Nimrodel.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Faramir.</li>
  <li>Quest: Faramir, Aragorn, Theodred, ready Aragorn, draw Despair to
remove 4 P from quest stage. Not sure what to do here as there are no P
on the quest, but would otherwise place 3 on as a result of the quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends against Muck Adder, no Shadow effect,
Aragorn kills it.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<p>I spent some extra time in here looking up rules for what happens when
quest spills over from Despair Treachery pulled from Encounter, couldn't
find a definitive resolution so decided to work in my favor and not put
any Progress out.</p>

<p>Time: 8:52</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<p>Time: 9:14</p>

<p>I'm trying to get some other things done between turns. It's not really
working out yet as I feel really drug out. Probably don't have enough
caffeine in me yet, my consumption has been ramping up.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Secret Paths, could be useful if Langflood comes up
again.</li>
  <li>Planning: Burning Brand on Denethor. I really need to get Steward of
Gondor in play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Faramir and Aragorn, draw Muck Adder. That's both of
them in this deck. Net 2 P on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Muck Adder.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends, draw Wargs, Shadow canceled. Aragorn puts 3
D on Muck Adder.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31. I need to get Threat controlled.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 9:21</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<p>Time: 9:44</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Secret Paths.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Aragorn, Denethor for 5 W, draw Grimbeorn! Awesome.
If I can only get him into play. Net 3 on quest. I need to get my Will
lowered, or this is going to be very fast game. Net 3 for 5 total P
on quest. Will need to start scrying now.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Muck Added, Denethor defends, no shadow, Aragorn kills Muck
Adder.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 9:49</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Protector of Lorien.</li>
  <li>Planning: Protector of Lorien on Aragorn. Denethor scries River
Langflood, we'll take it!</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Theodred Faramir, nets 1 P on Grimbeorn's Quest for 6
total, skating on thin ice here.</li>
  <li>Travel: River Langflood.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Really going to have a lot of trouble here if I can't reduce the threat.</p>

<p>Time: 9:55</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Gandalf, excellent.</li>
  <li>Planning. Denethor scries Marsh Adder, let's put him at the bottom of
the deck and hope nothing worse appears. Play Snowbourn Scout and put 1
P on River Langflood.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred and Aragorn and Faramir for 5, draw Hill Troll,
bummer. That's potentially a game killer. Only Aragorn can deal with
this, and if there is a bad Shadow effect, we're done. River Langflood
is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends, draw Shadow to remove 1 P from quest. Lucky.
Aragorn takes 4 hits.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 10:17</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<p>Time: 10:31</p>

<p>I'm not really getting a lot done in between turns, but I might, so I'm
keeping after it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Guard of the Citadel, which is a Gondor card,
which is good for playing For Gondor!</li>
  <li>Planning: Pay 8 to bring in Grimbeorn as an ally. This leaves me
with being able to bring in either Gandalf, or Daughter of Nimrodel, but
not both. Denethor scries Banks of the Anduin, which is good. I only
need to quest 3 to manage current Threat.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred. Faramir, draw Banks of Anduin for net 0, R to
Denethor.</li>
  <li>Travel: Banks of Anduin.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Grimbeorn defends against Hill Troll, Shadow none, takes 3 D.
Aragorn and Grimbeorn attack Hill Troll, deal 4 D.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 10:44</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<p>Time: 10:51</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Son of Arnor, which is excellent for engaging.</li>
  <li>Planning: Denethor scries another Muck Adder, surely the last one.
Play Guard of Citadel. Play Daughter of Nimrodel, heal 2 on Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred and Aragorn, draw Muck Adder, net 0 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Muck Adder.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn defends from Muck Adder, draw Shadow none, pay 1
for Valiant Sacrifice draw Sneak Attack and Dunedain Warning. Grimbeorn
takes 3 more from Hill Troll, Shadow is other Hill Troll! Grimbeorn,
Aragorn and Guard of Citadel kill Hill Troll. Faramir puts 1 D on Muck
Adder.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 11:08</p>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Daughter of Nimrodel.</li>
  <li>Planning: Denethor scries Goblin Sniper. Time to play Son of Arnor I
think. Not yet, we'll let this one go one round. Daughter heals Aragorn
2 Hits.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Theodred and Faramir, draw Goblin Sniper, net 1 P
on Banks of Anduin.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends Muck Adder, Shadow Wolf Rider, crap.
Grimbeorn defends, Shadow no effect, no damage on Grimbeorn. Guard of
Citadel deals 1 D to Muck Adder.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 11:33</p>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<p>Time: 11:38</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Valiant Sacrifice. I need another Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: Sneak Attack to lower threat to 32 with Gandalf. Play
Daughter of Nimrodel, heal total 4 on Beorn. Wolf Rider is next up, no
need to scry.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Aragorn and Faramir, net 0, draw Wolf Rider.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wolf Rider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends on Wolf Rider, Shadow remove 1 P from
current quest. Cool. Aragorn finishes off Muck Adder. Gandalf defends
against Wolf Rider, Shadow none, Grimbeorn kills Wolf Rider. Gandalf
back to hand.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 11:48</p>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Dunedain Mark.</li>
  <li>Planning: Denethor scries The East Bight, no problem! Daughters heal
up everyone.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Faramir, Aragorn, Guard for 7, draw The East Bight,
net 2 P clears Banks of Anduin which goes back on the deck.</li>
  <li>Travel: The East Bight.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 12:00</p>

<h4 id="round-11-1">Round 11</h4>

<p>Time: 12:10</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Rivendell Minstrell. Don't need this right yet.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Grimbeorn, Guard, Daughter, Faramir for 9 W,
draw Banks of the Anduin, net 6, clear The East Bight. Add 1 R.</li>
  <li>Travel: Banks of the Anduin.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Sniper.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends, Shadow negated by Burning Brand, Aragorn
kills Goblin Sniper.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 12:18</p>

<h4 id="round-12">Round 12</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 16, draw Song of Kings, which I don't really need at the
moment. But it only costs 1 so I should probably play it.</li>
  <li>Planning: Rivendell Minstrel. Dunedain Mark to Aragorn. Dunedain
Warning to Aragorn. Denethor scries Massing at Night, send to bottom of
the deck.</li>
  <li>Quest: We want to get through 1 more quest round before bringing out
the trolls I think. Theodred, Rivendell, Daughters, Faramir, draw Misty
Mountain Goblins, not bad, can deal with these no problem.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Misty Mountain Goblins.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends, no Shadow from Banks of Anduin, Grimbeorn
kills.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 12:36</p>

<h4 id="round-13">Round 13</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Dunedain Mark.</li>
  <li>Planning: Dunedain Mark to Aragorn. Denethor scries River Langflood.
This is what lost the last game, send it to the bottom.  Play Gandalf, Threat 31.</li>
  <li>Quest: Let's get the trolls now. Theodred, Daughters, Rinvendell
Minstrel, Faramir, draw Oakwood Grove, Stage 1 is clear.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Carrock.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Morris.</li>
  <li>Combat: Grimbeorn defends against Morris, Shadow no effect.
Grimbeorn, Gandalf and Aragorn attack with 13, Morris is le toast.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I can win this thing if I'm careful.</p>

<p>Time: 12:49</p>

<h4 id="round-14">Round 14</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Gandalf, excellent.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gandalf, Threat 27. Play Son of Arnor to draw in
Rupert. Denethor scries Banks of the Anduin, awesome.</li>
  <li>Quest: Daughters, Rivendell Minstrel, Theodred, Guard, Faramir, net 4
P on Carrock. I'm getting a bad feeling about this. Secret Paths on
Oakwood Grove, net 6 to clear Carrock.</li>
  <li>Travel: Oakwood Grove.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Grimbeorn defends, Shadow knocks out defense strength,
Grimbeorn takes 4 D. Aragorn, Gandalf, Grimbeorn kill Rupert.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 1:06</p>

<h4 id="round-15">Round 15</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Celebrian's Stone, which I don't really need.</li>
  <li>Planning: Daughter heals 2 from Grimbeorn. Denethor scries Oakwood
Grove, I'll take it.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Rivendell Minstrel, Daughter, Faramir for net 3 which
clears Oakwood Grove and puts 2 on Stage 2. Secret Paths played on
Oakwood Grove which was scried.</li>
  <li>Travel: Oakwood Grove.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Stuart</li>
  <li>Combat: Grimbeorn defends, Shadow none, takes 1 D. Aragorn, Grimbeorn
Son of Arnor, Theodred and Guard of Citadel attack swinging for 14,
Stuart is post toastee.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 1:18</p>

<h4 id="round-16">Round 16</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Daughter of Nimrodel. I've been playing this wrong.
Daughter of Nimrodel cannot heal Grimbeorn. Crap a doodle. I'll take him
out of play and put 8 D on Stuart. That should even it.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Forest Snare on Stuart. Denethor scries Sacked! send
that bad boy to the bottom.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred (R to Denethor) Rivendell Minstrel, Daughter, Guard,
Faramir for 8 W, draw Roasted Slowly for no effect, clear Oakwood Grove

  <li>Encounter: Louis.</li>
  <li>Combat: Daughter defends against Louis, Shadow remove 2 D from Troll,
which doesn't have any, so there. Threat 32. Aragorn and Son of Arnor
attack Louis for 5 D.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time: 1:31</p>

<h4 id="round-17">Round 17</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Protector of Lorien.</li>
  <li>Planning: Forest Snare on Louis. Denethor scries River Langflood,
I've got this now.</li>
  <li>Quest: Rivendell Minstrel, Daughter, Faramir, clears Banks of Anduin.</li>
  <li>Travel: River Langflood.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Theodred and Son of Arnor put 2 D on Stuart for the kill,
play For Gondor to get +1 for Guard and Aragorn to kill Louis.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's the slightly tainted win.</p>

<p>Time: 1:39</p>

<p>Long game.</p>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rounds: 170</li>
  <li>Damage: none</li>
  <li>VP: -4</li>
  <li>Threat: 33</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: 199.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I played this slightly wrong in a couple of ways, some favoring me,
others favoring the game. Notably:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Daughters of the Nimrodel healed 5-6 D from Grimbeorn at one point.
This is wrong, Daughters are only allowed to heal heroes. What I did
to remediate is take Grimbeorn out about where I thought he would
have been done in, and put the troll back in play without the damage
Grimbeorn would have inflicted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not playing Forest Snare when appropriate. Had I remembered to play
the Forest Snare correctly, I probably would have saved Grimbeorn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forgetting to use Valiant Sacrifice. This cost me a For Gondor! and
a Sneak Attack at the least.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There may be more mistakes, hard to say. This isn't exactly a clean win,
but with the cards played correctly as drawn, this was a winning game.
Having experience with what a winning game "feels like" is important.
I may play this again in the future, but for now, I'm moving to "A
Journey to Rhosgobel." That's supposed to be a fairly interesting
scenario, and one for which I'll need to use a different deck.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>

Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
