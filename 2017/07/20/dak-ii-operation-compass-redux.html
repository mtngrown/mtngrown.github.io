DAK-II: Operation Compass Redux
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul 20 2017</time>
<p>The following posted on BGA, copied here for amusement.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I still have a solo game of Fire in the Lake going on. I
took a stab at automating the US bot with Ruby. So far that effort is
1:0 in the game's favor. But I'll finish it ricky tic, only 39 cards to
go, lol.</p>

<p>But the pull of hex and counter is mighty. And Jock Campbell is pressing
to atone for his previous performance the back side of Halfaya Pass (you
ran out of petrol, Jock? Really?)</p>

<p>Hence, we're back to North Africa for a few weeks to ponder several
questions. For example, given 1T of trucking, of what use is 3 SP on a
beach surrounded by wadis, in literally, BFE? Should Maletti try to hold
Sidi el Barrani, or Buq Buq, or both? Or move LibOp to Halfaya Pass and
make a stand there?</p>

<p>More importantly, should the Western Desert command attempt to flank and
isolate Halfaya Pass, which requires a <em>really</em> fragile supply line, or
just go toe-to-toe with the Italians and retreat them out of Egypt?</p>

<p>Literally, BFE. Whose brilliant idea was that? Is this where the term
came from? I wouldn't be surprised.</p>

<hr />

<p>The goal for this game is working out the Commonwealth supply situation.
Without encircling the Italians lodged into Halfaya Pass, it's really
difficult to dislodge them from Egypt. But it's also very difficult to
get supply all the way around to the back for any forward CW unit
(talking to you Jock Stewart). The way the game is going to play out is
that the Italians will more or less hunker down to preserve their
positions as best they can, while the Brits figure out how to get the
supply chain established such that they can threaten Bardia.</p>

<p>A future game may see the Italians attempt a more active role.</p>

<p>While the CW forces are buzzing around, the Italians will be looking for
targets of opportunity, more to slow and interfere with the Brits than
attempting to destroy them.</p>

<p>Along the way I intend on digging pretty deep into the OCS rule set,
with a preliminary intention of memorizing supply rules. Supply is the
key to this game (OCS), and the less I have to think about it the better.</p>

<p>I will also be using air power this game. The first Operation Compass
game I played I left the airplanes alone.</p>

<h2 id="some-supply-counting">Some supply counting</h2>

<p>Before getting started, it's worth seeing can be done with supplies.</p>

<p>The first thing is seeing about that dump on the beach, surround by
wadis and cliffs. This makes it really difficult to move with a 1T
transport. After spending a leisurely evening counting hexes, the best
course of action is to use the beach dump for provisioning the organic
trucks for 7 Armor and 4 Indian.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/dak2/operation-compass-g2-setup.jpg" alt="DAK-2 Operation Compass Commonwealth Supply
consideration" /></p>

<p>These two divisions can use it up within 2-3 turns, easily. In the
meantime, the 1T truck has little choice other than to shuttle as much
of the supply at Mersah Matruh as far forward as possible. This can be
used to provision the Western Desert HQ.</p>

<h2 id="game-turn-1">Game Turn 1</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the upcoming turn for both sides.</p>

<p>The Italians are probably going to sit this turn out to see what the CW
forces get up to.</p>

<p>The CW is going to <em>not</em> move too far west on this first turn, in favor
of spending a turn getting another SP into throw range of Western
Desert. We'll see how that works out.</p>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Weather determination (2.3, probably on map)</li>
  <li>First player determination, roll d6 highest has initiative, reroll for
tie (2.3).</li>
</ul>

<p>Roll 4-1, clear weather.</p>

<h3 id="commonwealth-turn">Commonwealth Turn</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of CW goal this turn.</p>

<p>Commonwealth has a couple of goals this turn:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get the supply off the beach.</li>
  <li>Move as many T forward as possible given 1T transport.</li>
  <li>Position the WD HQ and supporting units to pester Maletti at Sidi el
Barrani.</li>
  <li>Move as much of 7 Armor and 4 Indian as possible to the west, without
getting out of supply, and without inviting counter-attack by Italian in
  hedgehogs. This will be the main positioning.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>No aircraft to refit this turn.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>Bring in 2 SP to Mersah Matruh.</p>

<h4 id="movement">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Breakout segment  (12.8e) Check trace to friendly units in supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nothing to do here.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>Lots going on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>7 Armor and 4 Indian fuel up from organic trucks, then the trucks
make a round trip to BFE to restock, and can make it all the way back
to their starting hex, just barely. This will allow fueling up next
turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2T moved forward. The transport can't make a full 2T every turn,
probably 5T every 3 turns. We'll see how it works. 6 Aus coming in
will help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 and 8 Hus overrun VEC in hex 36.13. Roll 2 + 6! Snake eyes! And a a
boxcar! There is no worse result for overrun! Dang! The odds go to
1:5, roll 7 + 2 for morale, net 9 for <code>AL1o1Do1</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try again with Strafer Gott and 7 &amp; 11 Hus, and 2 &amp; 6 RTR. No
surprise either way on this one, but the Brits did manage to get a
<code>DL1</code> but had to retreat rather than carry on through the overrun.
Was really hoping to keep going.</p>

    <p>After this movement, we have a huge, 5 RE stack packed up on the
plateau, and vulnerable to air barrage. Accordingly, the Blen IV
makes a barrage run on the strip at Amseet, as will be described
below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elements of 4 Indian move west across wadi and halt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pay 1T to fuel the WD HQ. This will need to move west for at least a
couple of turns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remaining 4 Ind and 7 Armor units moved west.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>Blen IV attacks airbase at Amseet, is intercepted by CR.42, who is lame
and rolls 3/3 on the Air Combat table. This results in an Abort with No
Effect, i.e., no step loss but CR.42 returns to strip as Inactive.
Flak fails. Now for the barrage: 4/4, no effect.</p>

<p>Naval barrage is no effect.</p>

<h4 id="supply">Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">This phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">

</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">It does not deal with the "On Map" supply provided by "S" and "T"

<p>All CW units in supply.</p>

  <li>Non-phasing player releases Reserves (5.7), destroy dumps (12.11).</li>
  <li>Non-phasing player barrage (all types, 10.0) and transport.</li>

<p>No Italian units in reaction.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase">Combat phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Artillery barrage (10.1, no Air/Naval)</li>
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>
</ol>

<p>No barrage or combat this turn. Poxy overruns.</p>

<h4 id="exploitation-phase">Exploitation phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Exploitation mode is defined in Section 5.9, with Exploition Phase
details defined in Section 11.0.</p>

<p>Nothing to exploit.</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove DG and Exploitation markers.</li>
  <li>Flip or remove Fueled markers.</li>
  <li>Remove train-busting placed by Allied player.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think is it for the CW this turn. The overrun failures really stung,
and that can't happen again, really need to perform here.</p>

<h3 id="italian-turn">Italian Turn</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Italian goal this turn.</p>

<p>Main goal of Italian is disrupting the big 7 Armor concentration. If they
can do this, they have essentially bought another turn.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-1">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>Nothing to refit this turn, the inactive fighter has to wait until next
turn I'm pretty sure. Maybe should read up on this point. I think I'm
right, otherwise there would be little motivation to barrage.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-1">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>2 SP at Bardia.</p>

<h4 id="movement-1">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Breakout segment</li>
  <li>Movement segment</li>
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment</li>
</ol>

<p>Italians reposition a leg unit to block an approach to Sidi el Barrani.</p>

<p>Air barrage on 7 Armor, first roll for flak, fails. Interceptions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Hurr. 1 vs. SM.79: roll (9+3-1)/6, defender (barrager) aborts inactive with step
loss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gladiator vs Ca.309: roll (6 + 2 -0)/1, barrager aborts inactive no step loss.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Very lucky for Brits. This could have been really bad.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn">End of Turn</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly recap the turn for both sides.</p>

<p>The CW really got into a bind with the overrun failures. This was just
bad luck. The idea here was to clear road to surround the big HQ stack
in the hedgehog and run it out of supply.</p>

<p>The Italians, having gotten lucky on the overrun defense, just couldn't
get past the CW interceptors to put the hurting on 7 Armor. And it
would have been a hurt.</p>

<p>Let's see how the next turn goes.</p>

<h2 id="game-turn-2">Game Turn 2</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the upcoming turn for both sides.</p>

<p>Italians are likely going to sit tight, as that's what worked for them
on the first game.</p>

<p>The CW is going to attempt to get the HQ moved way up to hopefully get
within range of taking Bardia. Should be able to advance it about half
the necessary distance this turn.</p>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase-1">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Weather determination (2.3, probably on map)</li>
  <li>First player determination, roll d6 highest has initiative, reroll for

</ul>

<p>Weather: clear.</p>

<p>CW player goes first this turn.</p>

<h3 id="commonwealth-turn-1">Commonwealth Turn</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Commonwealth goal this turn.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-2">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-2">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<h4 id="movement-2">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Breakout segment  (12.8e) Check trace to friendly units in supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>7 Armor and 4 Indian organic trucks refuel. The dump at BFE is
finished. Both divisions are fueled and the trucks are fueled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1T transport continues to shuttle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7 &amp; 11 Hus try to overrun 63 MG, success! Shift 4 right on 3:1, roll
10 + 3 for 13 on 9:1 for <code>Ae2DL203DG</code> IOW 63 MG is gone.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>At this point I need to get rid of the big stack of 21 It. For me to put
it out of supply renders me out of supply, risking a breakout if that
unit survives. 7 Armor is going for it for the overrun, there isn't
enough supply to get a full on combat otherwise. It would halt CW next
turn.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>7 Armor overruns 21 It: 5 + 3, no overrun, the odds aren't as good,
but armor, 22:7 as 21 It is out of trace for combat purposes,
so 3:1, roll 5 + 3 -1 net 7 on 2:1 <code>Al1Do1</code>. Brits
lose 8 Hus, very painful, Italians lose a step, who gives a shit. This is
not good for the CW, this is 2 7 Armor units which are eliminated,
which means it costs real supply to activate independent units.</p>

    <p>Basically, this was a total waste. Good to know.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remaining 7 Armor and 4 Indian surrounding 21 It to try and force an
attrition from lack of supply.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>Blen.IV makes a barrage run on 21 It, flak roll succeeds! Blen loses a
step! Dang!</p>

<p>Naval barrage east of Sidi el Barrani is no effect.</p>

<p>Not a great turn for the CW.</p>

<h4 id="supply-2">Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">This phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Determine which units are in or out of Trace Supply (12.6)</li>
  <li>Replenish low or exhausted internal stocks (12.10)</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">It does not deal with the "On Map" supply provided by "S" and "T"
counters.</p>

<p>This is really, really bad. Four units of 4 Indian are out of supply
north of the 21 It HQ:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/dak2/operation-compass/g2-t2-4ind-out-of-supply.jpg" alt="4 Indian goes out of
supply" /></p>

<p>Attrition roll 10 for the east stack, all units lost, roll 5 for the
west stack, no losses. Bad, really bad. 21 It can probably escape.</p>

<p>Actually, I think the western stack is in trace as the WD HQ can throw
to the adjacant hex which is ZOC-negated. WD cannot throw to an adjacent
hex for the eastern stack as 21 It has ZOC on the adjacent hex, and
wadis cost too much to cross.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-2">Reaction phase</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Saving 21 It,</li>

<p>This is going to majorly suck for CW.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-3">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p>At Maktila, defender surprise with 2 shifts, this sucks for the
Italians, moves it to 1:2, roll 4 - 2 for <code>AL2</code> which will come from
step losses on the divisional units. Not that big of a deal, really.
That did cost 7T though. Italians need to move some supplies if
possible. This shouldn't be a problem, they have 2T of transport at
Bardia.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly recap the turn for both sides.</p>

<p>This was not a good turn for the Commonwealth! The 4 Indian especially
took it on the nose. Had the 4 Indian moved up the organic truck, it
would have been able to eat off the map to stay in supply. Something to
note for the next game.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the upcoming turn for both sides.</p>

<p>CW needs to make some motion at Sidi el Barrani, and get the Western

<p>The Italians need do little more than continue to be very unpleasant
speed bumps.</p>

<p>Weather is clear.</p>

<p>The Allies have the initiative yet again. Very lucky for them.</p>

<h3 id="allied-turn">Allied Turn</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allied goal this turn.</p>

<p>The absolute minimum goal for this turn is using 6 Aus as a relief force
to break out the trapped unit on the coast east of Sidi el Barrani. 6
Aus is going in as an overrun. I may hold the armor unit back in reserve in
case the overrun fails. After the overrun either succeeds or fails, they
are going to bombard and attack. There is plenty of supply.</p>

<p>The Blen is going to start transporting T forward as well. Hopefully 2T
per turn, still reading the rules on that. Since there aren't any
airbases (only airstrips), supplies will need to be air dropped, which
risks losing supplies. No big deal, that's how it has to be. The Blen
has 146 MF, the distance to the target hex I want to use is 18 hexes.
I'm going to combine rules for Air Transport and Air Drop and allow the
Blen to make 2 trips for 2T moved, then go inactive at its home base.</p>

<p>Western Desert:</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-4">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft

<p>Having to read back through to see which CW aircraft need refitting, if
any. Two of them are at airfields which are printed on the map, so it's
not clear, and I don't have markers for, which are needing refitting.

<p>Here's the plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>6 Aus moves from Mersah Matruh to overrun (8.0) ar 42.15. Odds are
22:3, which is 7:1, one shift for AR (Aus is Green). Defenders need 1T
from Sidi, 1T from Buq Buq. 6 Aus spends 4T to attack. Roll for
surprise 3/4, that's defender surprise with 4 shifts left. Dang. This is
the second or third time (at least) this game where defender has gained
huge surprise. This will damage 6 Aus, not good having divisional units
eliminated. Roll 8 + 1 net 9 <code>Ao1Do1</code> 6 Aus has to power on as there are
trapped units behind these Italians, eliminate 6 Aus 19 Mech and It 6 Lt.
6 Aus goes again, no choice, roll 7 + 1 no surprise, roll 7 + 1 for 8
yields <code>Ao e4 1DL1o2</code>. CW takes the option to retreat, the Italians have
a mandatory loss. This will let the trapped Brits move 1 hex east into
supply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trapped units just east of Maktili move east and southeast to get
another crack at the Italians. They're in throw range of Mersah, no
reason not to go for it. They're also non-divisional units, easier to
lose. Since these are all leg units, no supply necessary to move.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1T to Bir Emba, other T failed the Air Drop. I replaced those dice,
low rolling sons of bitches. Blen inactive at Mersah.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7 Arm 2 &amp; 6 RTR move on the Ciran ID. This is an 18:12, but we have
surprise for a 2 shift and +3 for morale roll, combat roll 9 + 3 net
12 on 4:1 in the clear for <code>Ae4DL1o2</code>. This is another step loss for
Ciran, and it moves down the escarpment. This also puts Ciran in
Exhausted and DG and I don't think there are any more supplies coming for this
unit. 2 &amp; 6 RTR have just enough movement to overrun again. Roll for
surprise 6 + 4 (Ciran AR 1 for DG) yields surprise shift 5. Ok, not sure
what the odds are… 14:3 which is 5:1, roll 6 + 4/6 for surprise, Ciran
is toast. Boxcars on 13:1, <code>DL2</code> with a bunch more stuff which doesn't
matter here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few other units poking around to ensure supply lines are in place
at least for this turn. The Its will almost surely bust these up, being
trapped in and around Sidi, they have nothing to lose at this point.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allies goal this turn.</p>

<p>If the Italians can stay 2 more turns in the Sidi el Barrani area, there
is almost no way the CW can win it. Let's see if we can make that
happen. The big question is how supply is treated at Sidi el Barrani, as
2 &amp; 6 RTR is nearly cutting off trace, which would mean no throw
available.</p>

<p>This is where the action really is, what the Italians do this turn will
matter a lot for the rest of the game. Specifically, whether the
Italians can get Sidi AO into supply. It's doable, and may be able to
drive 2 &amp; 6 RTR back a hex or two.</p>

<p>Some of the larger divisions have moved up as well. I don't think this
will be a "last stand" for the Italians, but it will seriously impede CW
forces, if not push the back outright. Here's what it looks like at the
end of movement phase.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/dak2/operation-compass/g2-t3-it-buq-buq.jpg" alt="Italians attempting to beat back Brits at Buq
Buq" /></p>

<p>It was a tough decision to put the 28 ID blocking the trail rather than
moving it up to fight with 2 &amp; 6 RTR, but the Italians really, really
don't want the Brits getting a foothold west of Buq Buq. I could have
put 30 GAF there, and maybe that would have been better.</p>

<p>Sadly, the Italians neglected to move any T to airfields where they
could be airdropped to Sidi el Barrani. This would allow them to fuel up
and move west instead of being speed bumps. Will do the fuel movement
right now.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-3">End of Turn 3</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly recap the turn for both sides.</p>

<p>This was a terrible end of turn for the CW forces, and recaps how lucky
the Italians have been with surprise rolls and combat results. I do not
see how the CW can achieve push the Italians out of Egypt in 3 turns,
but let's see what happens.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the upcoming turn for both sides.</p>

<p>Given that the Italians don't really have to do a whole lot to win,
their next move should be to consolidate a defense in depth on the
Libyan border. Make the CW come to them, and make them pay to get
through. Historically, the CW didn't get to Bardia until many days after
capturing Sollum, so this has some historical justification. The second
important thing is to ensure the CW cannot flank around Halfaya Pass to
cut off forward units from the supply in Bardia.</p>

<p>The CW is in a major pickle. Historically, some bold moves toppled the
Italian defenders quickly. In this universe, the Italians sacced up and
punched back pretty hard. The CW has two options: 1. make a run for
Halfaya Pass and try to cut off the Italian consolidation, and, or 2.
attempt to flank the Italians to cut them off from Bardia.</p>

<p>Game is half over, but the outcome is still uncertain.</p>

<p>I forgot to restock 1 Lib last turn, I need to do that now and give it a
tick to move it. That cost 3 ticks, but the unit is now lodged in
Halfaya pass, and it's AR 3, which will stiffen the AR 1 division

<p>The CW has some very hard choices to make. While Sidi el Barrani has

headed to Halfaya Pass. It looks like a Hail Mary is needed. Which sort
of makes sense as extreme boldness was what gave the battle to the CW
historically. The question is will the dice play ball. Stay tuned and
find out.</p>

<p>This could be ugly. It's a bit less than 1:1 raw, which rounds to 1:1,
but in close terrain. The CW needs surprise here very badly. If they get
a defender surprise, I'm probably going to call the game. Roll 8/4,
using Strafer Gott we get an AR differential of 6 - 3 = +3 for 10,
attacker surprise with 4 right shift. Excellent, CW is still in the
game. Roll 9 + 3 for 12 on <code>Ao1e4DLo2</code>.</p>

<p>Getting the Exploit result might be a game winner for the CW.</p>

<p>The Italians made a mistake by not leaving a unit in 41.28, because they
have to retreat…ah, OCS allows defending units to retreat in different

the CW is toast.</p>

<p>Roll 9/3 which is 9 + 4 attacker surprise with 3 column shift in clear

Strafer Gott is wounded, out until May 1941. If the CW retains intiative

<p>3 combats to handle, and with luck, the Italians can wipe out the CW
advance.</p>

<p>First, the Ragg. group attempts an overrun on 7 Hus. No surprise, odds
3:1 in the clear, -1 DRM for AR differential +1 for Ragg. command, roll
5 on 3:1 in the clear, <code>AL1Do1</code>, defender retreats. This is a sad result
for the Italians, as that was their best unit here.</p>

<p>Next, try to take out most of remaining 7 Armor, will be 6:1 roll
surprise 10/6 - 3, actually they have no chance, AR differential too
large. Roll combat 9 - 2 for <code>Ao1DL1o1</code>, 7 Hus is done, 1 RTR retreat
down the escarpment. This is doable for the CW. Maybe not for the win in
6 turns, but the tide has turned I think. Actually, if the CW can clear
Sollum, they may be able to turn the flank and cut the rest of the
Italians off.</p>

<p>Last, 1:1 on remnants of 7 Armor, no surprise, roll 4 for <code>AL2</code>, no big
deal, but this puts 7 Armor in Low supply from having to use internal
stocks. The Italian units here were 202 MG and Ctnzr, 202 leading and

<code>Ao1Do1</code> Sollum is captured.</p>

<p>That's all we got.</p>

<h4 id="supply-9">Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">This phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Determine which units are in or out of Trace Supply (12.6)</li>
  <li>Replenish low or exhausted internal stocks (12.10)</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">It does not deal with the "On Map" supply provided by "S" and "T"
counters.</p>

<p>CW is in trace.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-9">Reaction phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Non-phasing player releases Reserves, etc.</li>
  <li>Non-phasing player barrage</li>
</ol>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-9">Combat phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Artillery (no Air/Naval)</li>
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>
</ol>

<p>None, no supply available for fighting.</p>

<h4 id="exploitation-phase-9">Exploitation phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment</li>
  <li>Barrage segment</li>
  <li>Combat segment</li>
</ol>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="allies-clean-up-phase-1">Allies clean Up phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove DG and Exploitation markers.</li>
  <li>Flip or remove Fueled markers.</li>
  <li>Remove train-busting placed by Italian player.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good to go.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-5">End of Turn 5</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly recap the turn for both sides.</p>

<p>I'm calling it here, as the CW just won't have enough supply to even
move to flank, despite taking Sollum. If there was even one more turn,
CW would have it. But going into Low and Exhausted precludes getting
enough supply forward to finishing next turn, even if the CW got the
initiative.</p>

<p>Pretty good game overall. I need to play this opposed some time.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What's the difference between motorized and mechanized?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can I move 1T from Bardia to Sidi el Barrani per turn via sea shipping?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SP for refits I'm taking from within draw range, that is, 5 truck MF.
For airdrops, I'm requiring the T for dropping need to be on the
airfield when the turn of the airdrop kicks off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not clear on drawing from organic trucks to mitigate being out of
throw. The rules seem to either be contradictory or the case is
irrelevant. The idea is one can use Internal Stock if out of trace,
unless an organic truck is within throw, in which case (I read) one
can use Internal Stocks <em>from</em> the trucks, which still leaves a Low
marker. That makes no sense. Better to leave the SP on the trucks for
the following turn.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="various-rules-of-interest">Various rules of interest</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>13.6c Transport points enter the board loaded if entering colocated
with a dump. I'm taking that to mean in this game that the 1T transport
at Mersah Matruh comes in loaded. It doesn't matter a lot, but mattering
a little might matter a lot in the long run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would be good to get clarity on the supply situation in Turn 2 for 4
Indian. I think I played it correctly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The Sea Cap at Bardia is 2T, but the Italian gets 2 SP per turn at Bardia
for reinforcements. This implies that Sea Cap at Bardia is irrelevant
for this scenario, and that interdiction or Sea Cap destruction is
irrelevant. Is this in fact true?</li>
</ol>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
