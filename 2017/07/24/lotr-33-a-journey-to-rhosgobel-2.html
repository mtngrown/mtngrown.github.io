LotR 33 - A Journey to Rhosgobel (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul 24 2017</time>
<p>Second play of A Journey to Rhosgobel using this custom
Decklist <a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5837/tactics-spirit-for-rhosgobel-1.0">built and published on
RingsDB</a>.
In the first game, Wilyador expired, I wasn't able to get any healing
going, bummer. My intention is to play this deck again as-is, making
note of cards which don't seem to work.</p>

<p>Initial draw, mulligan for Radagast:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Radagast</li>
  <li>Radagast</li>
  <li>Gondorian Spearman</li>
  <li>The Eagles Are Coming!</li>
  <li>Blade Mastery</li>
  <li>Born Aloft</li>
</ol>

<p>I decided to mulligan to get Radagast into my hand. Very hard to heal
without Radagast.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Quick Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Dol Goldur Orcs, 2 D to Thalin.
Net 2 P on <em>The Wounded Eagle</em>.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Wilyador defends, Shadow Exhaustion deals 1 D to each
exhausted character, not an auspicious start. Thalin is 3/4 D already.
That sucks. Legolas swings for 3, DGO are dead and +2 P to quest.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Quick Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Radagast now so he can start drawing resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Eowyn, draw Forest Grove, net +2 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: Forest Grove.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4 + 1, draw Born Aloft.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gondorian Spearman with Born Aloft.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin and Wilyador, draw Swarming Insects to deal 1
Damage to each character without an attachment. This blows Thalin and
Gondorian Spearman out of the game. That blows, real bad. It does clear
Forest Grove and <em>The Wounded Eagle</em>, so I can grab an Athelas card now.
Exhaust Legolas for Athelas.</li>
  <li>Travel: Rhosgobel.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now I need to make a decision on whether to continue or not. Landroval
could bring Thalin back into the game at a cost of 5, which could be
borne in part by Radagast. This could work if Landroval comes up in the
next couple of turns. If not, probably won't work.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Favor of the Lady, which would go real well on
Thalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Radagast, draw Festering Wounds which deals 2 D to each
wounded character. That takes out Eowyn and Radagast.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>You Lose Now.</strong></p>

<p>Ok, that was a quick game. I could have played another 2 or 3 rounds I'm
pretty sure, but there is no way I could win being down two heros and
Radagast. I think this is fastest loss I've had in many games, possibly
ever, although I usually play out the hopeless situations another couple
of turns. Then again, those situations aren't usually this hopeless
either.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
