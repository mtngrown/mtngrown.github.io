LotR 36 - The Hills of Emyn Muil (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul 28 2017</time>
<p>New quest, new deck, same general strategy: draw cards as fast as
possible, and scry as much as possible. Once the deck is running,
should be able to draw five cards per turn. Since the quest is a fairly
long one, with lots of locations, it makes sense to get as many cards
in play as fast as possible.</p>

<p>For this quest, I decided to plan carefully. Our band of searchers
needs to know the lay of the land, and what we might expect to find
out there. We know there is a lot of rugged terrain, and that the Eye
is watching the area carefully as well, but there isn't that much
other activity than a few bands of roving orcs. With so few Orcs
in the area, it's no wonder Gollum finds it a refuge.</p>

<p>(By "plan carefully" I mean "examine the encounter deck.")</p>

<p>Initial draw:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Valiant Sacrifice</li>
  <li>Strider's Path</li>
  <li>Protector of Lorien</li>
  <li>Henamarth Riversong</li>
  <li>Celebrian's Stone</li>
  <li>Steward of Gondor</li>
</ol>

<p>Not bad, I'll take it.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Song of Wisdom and Strider's Path.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Henamarth, scry Treacherous Fog, no big deal.</li>
  <li>Quest: All, would be nice to pull cards from Beravor, but don't
want to risk the Threat increase this would induce. Draw Treacherous
Fog, Threat 28.</li>
  <li>Travel: Amon Hen.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Secret Paths and Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: Steward of Gondor on Theodred, scry Impassable Chasm.
Celebrian's Stone on Bilbo.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred and Bilbo, draw Impassable Chasm, net 0 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: Amon Hen, Beravor draw Faramir and Infighting.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Forest Snare and Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Henamarth scries Eastern Crows, which is a Surge card.
Protector of Lorien on Bilbo. Play Faramir.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo for 3, draw Eastern Crows and Impassable Chasm, Threat
increases to 32.</li>
  <li>Travel: Amon Hen. Beravor draws Haldir of Lorien and Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Eastern Crows.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir defends, draw Shadow Dol Goldur Orcs, no effect on
Faramir with defense 2. Theodred kills Eastern Crows.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33. Bummer.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw A Burning Brand and Gleowine.</li>
  <li>Planning: Henamarth scries Orc Horse Thieves. Play Haldir with A
Burning Brand. Song of Wisdom on Theodred, who can pay for Gleowine.</li>
  <li>Quest: Beravor, Theodred, Bilbo, Faramir, Gleowine for 10, draw
Orc Horse Thieves, Amon Hen is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none, we'll leave Amon Lhaw in the Staging area for now
as it cancels Attachments, which would be very inconvenient.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Orc Horse Thieves.</li>
  <li>Combat: Haldir defends against Orc Horse Thieves, Shadow draw
Slick Footing for no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Haldir and Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Henamarth scries Impassable Chasm, which will gain
Surge as there is no active location. Bummer. That will slow
down the questing this phase, but I don't need much. Forest Snare on
Orc Horse Thieves.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo and Theodred, draw Impassable Chasm with Surge Slick
Footing. This has no effect as I have no progress out on anything. After
resolving that, I get 2 P on the quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. Beravor draw Henamarth Riversong and Radagast's
Cunning. Gleowine draw Grim Resolve. Interesting.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat:  Haldir and Faramir can put 1 D on Orc Horse Thieves.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35. Bad.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Rivendell Minstrel and Infighting.</li>
  <li>Planning: Henamarth scries Impassable Chasm, which will surge, so we
can't exhaust everyone. Play Rivendell Minstrel. put Song of Kings in
hand.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Rivendell Minstral and Bilbo, draw Impassable Chasm which surges to
The Highlands, weak. Net 3 P on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: Amon Lhaw. Beravor draws Secret Paths and Valiant
Sacrifice. Gleowine draws Longbeard Orc Slayer.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Haldir defends because Forest Snare Attachment is
negated by Amon Lhaw, Shadow is The Highlands for no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Gandalf and Gandalf. (!)</li>
  <li>Planning: Henamarth scries The Outer Ridge. Play Sneak Attack Gandalf
to reduce Threat to 31. Play Song of Kings on Beravor, play Longbeard
Orc Slayer.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Bilbo, Rivendell Minstrel, Haldir for 9, clears
Amon Lhaw, which is good because attachments now work again.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Outer Ridge. Beravor draws Daughter of Nimrodel
and Dunedain Quest.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Orcs are snared, Gandalf and Faramir put 3 D on Orcs. hehe.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>I forgot to deal a Shadow card on the snared Orc. Need to remember to do
that next turn.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Gandalf and Infighting.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Dol Goldur Beastmaster, which has Threat 35, hence not
an issue for this round. Also, I intend on playing Infighting on that
bad boy. Will probably do that this turn, because why not?</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred and Bilbo for 5 total, draw Dol Goldur Beastmaster.
This clears <em>The Outer Ridge</em>.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Highlands. Beravor draws Sneak Attack and Silverlode
Archer. Gleowine draws Haldir of Lorien.</li>
  <li>Encounter: We will engage Dol Goldur Beastmaster, and play Infighting
to send that dude right to the discard pile with the 5 Damage from Orc
Horse Thieves.</li>
  <li>Combat: We can put more damage on Orc Horse Thieves just in case we
get more Infighting. Shadow card is The Highlands, good to get that
out of the way. Longbeard, Haldir and Faramir put 3 D on Orc Horse
Thieves.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Looks like I might get through the whole deck.</p>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 17, draw Forest Snare and Gleowine. Lots of good cards
to discard once I need to do that.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Orc Horse Thieves. Play Gandalf, Threat 28.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Bilbo, draw Orc Horse Thieves, clear The Highlands
for 13 VP. Threat 30.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. Beravor draws Faramir and Forest Snare, Gleowine draws
Rivendell Minstrel.</li>
  <li>Encounter: We'll pull down the Orc Horse Thieves since we have
Gandalf already in play.</li>
  <li>Combat: Haldir defends, Shadow is Enchanted Stream which has no
effect due to A Burning Brand. No effect on Haldir. Gandalf, Longbeard
and Faramir swing for 7 putting net 5 D on Orc Horse Thieves. They will
go another round, dammit. I'll leave the next ones in Staging I think.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 18, draw Protector of Lorien and Dunedain Quest.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gleowine draws Rivendell Minstrel. Play Silverlode Archer.

anyone on the quest. Problem solved.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Rockslide.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Haldir defends Orc Horse Thieves, Shadow is <em>The North
Stair</em>, bummer, would have liked to travel there. Faramir and Longbeard
send them home. Other Shadow is <em>The East Wall of Rohan</em>. That's 6 VP
lost to Shadow effects.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32, Beravor draws Protector of Lorien and Longbeard
Orc Slayer.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

  <li>Travel: none. Beravor draws Daughter of the Nimrodel and Gleowine,
Gleowine draws Self Preservation.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Shadow card is Orc Horse Thieves, good, not a location.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rounds: 170</li>
  <li>Threat: 33</li>
  <li>Heroes: 0</li>
  <li>Damage: 0</li>
  <li>VP: -20</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: 183.</p>

<p>The Encounter deck for Hill of Emyn Muil is very heavy
on locations and treachery, and doesn't have that many
enemies in it. The main bad boy is Cheiftain Ufthak, with
a few Dol Goldur Orcs and Beastmasters tossed in. The Emyn
Muil itself brings in Orc Horse Thieves, which have a lot
of hit points, but aren't especially powerful.</p>

<p>The worst Treachery is probably Pursued by Shadow, given an
"allies heavy" strategy. Driven by Shadow is pretty nasty as
well.</p>

<p>The key to the deck is scry scry scry. Without Henamarth scrying early
on, things could get ugly fast. Denethor might be a good substitute
for Theodred, provided a good Leader Hero in Theodred's place.</p>

<p>I could probably have used about half this deck and succeeded, but
with the amount of card draw, an extra 10-15 cards doesn't matter that
much. On the other hand, I didn't draw Driven by Shadow or Pursued
by Shadow, or Chieftain Ufthak. Had I drawn those and taken
serious damage, the outcome could have been very different.</p>

<p>One major mistake in this play was leaving the snared Orc Horse Thieves
in play too long. While it was pretty brilliant to use Infighting, it
also sucked up some valuable locations dealt as Shadow cards, which
likely drew the game out an extra 2-3 turns.</p>

<p>All in all, I'm a little surprised I knocked this thing out on my
first play. I guess it means I'm getting the hang of it.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.

<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."

</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
