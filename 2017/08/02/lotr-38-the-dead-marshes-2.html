LotR 38 - The Dead Marshes (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug  2 2017</time>
<p>Game 2 in The Dead Marshes with a <a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5931/spirit-tactics-for-the-dead-marshes-1.0">Spirit/Tactics
deck</a>.</p>

<p>The first game didn't go that well. I was learning the mechanics
of the scenario, and how the deck worked.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quick Strike</li>
  <li>Swift Strike</li>
  <li>Citadel Plate</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial Encounter draw Through the Mist. This requires an Escape check,
which I'm going to pass on, putting 1 R on Gollum and raising Threat
to 28.</p>

<h3 id="round-1">Round 1</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw A Test of Will. This weird, I've shuffled the deck
really hard, more than once, and I'm getting these duplicate cards.</li>
  <li>Planning: none</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw A Wisp of Pale Sheen, Eleanor cancels, draw Giant
Marsh Worm, net 3 P on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Veteran Axe hand.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw March Adder, net 0 quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Rrefresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Horn of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Impassable Bog, Threat 31.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Born Aloft.</li>
  <li>Planning: Citadel Plate on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Heart of the Marshes, Threat 35. Crap.</li>
  <li>Travel: Heart of the Marshes.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Engage Giant Marsh Worm.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli takes Giant Marsh Worm attack undefended, draw Evil
Storm, no effect. Gimli and Eleanor put 4 hits on it, lose 2, net 2 D.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Hasty Stroke. Where are my Northern Trackers?</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Goblin Sniper. Threat 37.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, draw Shadow none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Born Aloft.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Vetern Axehand with Born Aloft. Tactics is hurting
badly for resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Hill Troll, and that's the game. Threat 41.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll and Marsh Adder.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends against Hill Troll, takes +4 D. Veteran Axehand
defends against Marsh Adder, no Shadow effect, kill Veteran Axehand. Eleanor
defends agains Giant Marsh Worm, takes +1 D. Nothing to attack back
with.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 15, draw Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Unexpected Courage on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Giant Marsh Worm.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's the game, four high hit point enemies engaged with only three
characters on the board, and 2 of them at their limit on hit points.
That is, Gimli and Eleanor are dead pretty much no matter what happens,
even with Gimli going ready again.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This deck should be performing better than this. The scenario isn't
really
that difficult, but for some reason, I'm getting bad draws from both
Encounter deck and my deck. Sadly, the Encounter draws would be awesome
just a couple of turns later in the game when I had a bit more combat
on the table. Being able to knock out all the enemies early on is really
helpful. It was just too early here.</p>

<p>Looking through the deck, it turns out almost all the Allies were at the
bottom of the deck. Really not much can be done about that when the
strategy relies on playing allies.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
