LotR 41 - The Dead Marshes (5)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug  3 2017</time>
<p>Usually after a win I move the next scenario, but I want to dig a little
deeper into the winning deck to see how it plays in a longer game. My
hunch is that if the deck doesn't win within 5-6 rounds, it's probably
not going to win. Hard to say without playing through a few times.</p>

<p>Specifically, I'm interested in the deck behaviour without Steward of
Gondor. I'm curious whether it will be possible to get enough allies in
play to quest and pass escape attempts.</p>

<p>Decklist <a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5932/the-dead-marshes-leadership-lore-1.0">built and published on
RingsDB</a>.</p>

<p>Initial hand after 1 mulligan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>Dunedain Mark</li>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>Song of Wisdom</li>
  <li>Campfire Tales</li>
  <li>Protector of Lorien</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial encounter is Evil Storm, no effect.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Impassable Bog.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Aragorn, draw Impassable Bog, net +2 P, ready Aragon
for Escape test, draw Impassable Bog, fail test.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Faramir. Scry Impassable Bog.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Theodred, draw Impasaable Bog, net +1 P. Escape
commit Aragorn and Faramir, draw The Lights of the Dead, fail.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now in danger of Hill Troll.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Strider's Path.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Pursued by Shadow, I'll take it. Play Erebor
Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Theodred, Faramir, Erebor Hammersmith, draw Pursued
by Shadow, Threat 31 b/c Denethor not questing. Net +5 P. Ready Aragorn
for Escape commit, draw A Wisp of Sheen, fail.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Strider's Path.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry <em>The Brown Lands</em>. How to deal with this. Strider's
Path can pull it directly into the active location without resolving
the effect, which is to put 1 P on it, so I'll need 6 P to clear the
first stage. Question is do I want to do that now or wait another round?
Play Protector of Lorien on Aragorn. Play Snowbourn Scout, will net 1
more P.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Theodred, Faramir, Snowbourn Scout, Erebor for 8 Will,
play Strider's Path to pull in the Brown Lands, net +6 P which clears
The Brown Lands and Stage 1. Ready Aragorn for Escape commit, draw <em>The
Lights of the Dead</em> which is Escape 5. Dang. I can't do it. Another
R on Gollum.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not getting the cards I need out of my deck. Fortunately, the
Encounter deck is not completely beserk. Yet.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Song of Kings. Not what I need right now.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Evil Storm, no problem, can let that pass.</li>
  <li>Quest: Faramir, Theodred, draw Evil Storm. Escape commit Aragorn,
Erebor, draw Despair, no effect.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>Could be in real trouble now.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Valiant Sacrifice.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Wolf Rider, send to bottom of deck as it's a
surge card. Play Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Theodred. No choice here, I have to take the Threat increase
as there is no way I could pass Stage 2 and beat 4 tokens on Gollum.
Draw Treacherous Fog, discard Campfire Tales to call this net even.
Escape commit Aragorn, Erebor, Faramir and Snowbourn Scout x 2, draw
Giant Marsh Worm, 7 beats 2.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>With 3 Gandalf I need one right now to pull this out. I think going
forward maybe swap out Campfire Tales for Galadhrim's Greeting.</p>

<p>Also, I need to remember that Faramir bumps Will for the phase. So
if he isn't played during Quest, he can be played for Escape.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Dunedain Quest. I need more allies.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Fens and Mires, play Dunedain Quest on Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Aragorn, draw Fens and Mires, net 0 P but
Fens and Mires can be cleared with Strider's Path. Escape commit
Aragorn Faramir, Erebor, Snowbourn Scouts, draw Giant Marsh Worm.
Excellent.</li>
  <li>Travel: Impassable Bog, I hate to do this, but I need time to
get more allies on the table. This is just going to get a whole
lot more time than I want.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Steward of Gondor. Interesting. I think I
can win this one, but it might go pretty long.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Steward of Gondor on Denethor, Song of Wisdom on
Theodred. I need some freaking card draw. Scry Wargs. Crap. Now the
damage starts.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Erebor and Theodred, draw Wargs, net 2 P. Escape
commit Aragorn, draw Fens and Mires, pass.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wargs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends, draw Shadow The Lights of the Dead
which has Escape 5 but no Shadow effect so Wargs go back in the Staging
area. Play Valiant Sacrifice, draw Valiant Sacrifice and Dunedain Quest.
No Ally card. They must be at the bottom of the deck. This is crazy.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 16, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Snowbourn Scout. Scry Evil Storm, to the bottom of the
deckâ€¦ if a troll comes up it's pretty much game over.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Theodred and Erebor for 6 W, draw Hill Troll. Crap.
I don't have any way of inflicting damage on that thing. Wargs are
coming back out as well. Ready Aragorn for defense, Escape check
autofail.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll, Wargs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends for Hill Troll, no Shadow, takes 4 Damage.
Snowbourn defends Wargs, Shadow none, kills Snowbourn Scout and back
to Staging. Play Valiant Sacrifice, draw A Burning Brand and Faramir.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 19, draw Celebrian's Stone.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Celebrian's Stone and Dunedain Mark on Aragorn.
Scry The Brown Lands. Good thing I have one more Strider's Path.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn for 7 with Protector of Lorien discard spare
Faramir, draw The Brown Lands, play Strider's Path to move to
<em>The Brown Lands</em> putting Impassable bog back into Staging,
ready Aragorn. Net 3 P, clear Brown Lands, clear Stage 2,
make a victory check right now by drawing 5 (1) escape cards.
Escape commit is Aragorn, Theodred, Faramir, Erebor, Snowbourn
Scout for 12, draw 11 Escape!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aar">AAR</h3>

<p>Managed to win it after all! A pox on those wargs and that Troll.
We got the Gollum out of there.</p>

<p>Good thing, too, as I was going to concede if I failed this one. I guess
it just goes to show there is more than one way to win, and it's
important to take advantage of whatever opportunities the cards
deliver, instead of basing a strategy on what one needs the
cards to deliver.</p>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rounds: 80</li>
  <li>Threat: 38</li>
  <li>Heroes: 0</li>
  <li>Damage: 4</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: 122.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
