                LotR 45 - Escape from Dol Goldur (3)
              </h1>
              <time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug  6 2017</time>
              <p>Using the "<a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5957/back-to-basics-tri-sphere-1.0">Back
              to Basics</a>" deck
              for the third play.</p>
              
              <p>So far, I'm finding that this scenario doesn't really reward good play,
              but will brutally punish anything less than perfect play. There is no
              respite.</p>
              
              <p>Initial hand:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
                <li>Faramir</li>
                <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
                <li>Sneak Attack</li>
                <li>Sneak Attack</li>
                <li>Guard of the Citadel</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Initial Encounter:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Dungeon Torch has Dol Goldur Beastmaster.</li>
                <li>Shadow Key has King Spider.</li>
                <li>Gandalf's Map has Great Forest Web.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Resource: 2, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
                <li>Planning: none.</li>
                <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Under the Shadow, raise Threat by 1
              per player. Net -4 P for Threat 31.</li>
                <li>Travel: none, can't afford to lose Theodred next turn.</li>
                <li>Encounter: King Spider.</li>
                <li>Combat: Undefended so that Theodred can get in a lick.
              Draw Endless Caverns which has no Shadow effect. 3 D for
              Theodred, he returns 1 D to Spider.</li>
                <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>I think I should have played Snowbourn Scout, which would have allowed
              a chump block for the Kind Spider, as well as putting a P on Great
              Forest Web.</p>
              
              <p>It also just occurred to me that I will not be able to attach
              Shadow Key to Theodred as he's already out of hit points.</p>
              
              <h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Resource: 4, draw Steward of Gondor.</li>
                <li>Planning: play Steward of Gondor on Theodred, exhaust to get 2, then
              play Snowbourn Scout. Also play Unexpected Courage on Theodred now that
              Eowyn has the resources.</li>
                <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (put R on Eowyn), draw Eyes of the Forest
              which discards all the Event cards from my hand, which is to say,
              two copies of Sneak Attack. This is unfortunate, as I was going to use
              Sneak Attack to bring in Faramir to kill the King Spider, which will now
              survive another turn. This does net 1 P on Stage 1 <em>The Necromancer's
              Tower</em>, so I'm doing a little better than Games 1 and 2.</li>
                <li>Travel: none.</li>
                <li>Encounter: none.</li>
                <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends, Shadow for King Spider is Dol Goldur
              Beastmaster for no effect. Theodred deals 1 D to King Spider.</li>
                <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Resource: 6, draw A Test of Will.</li>
                <li>Planning: play Faramir.</li>
                <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Necromancer's Reach and cancel with
              A Test of Will. This would have been game ending as Theodred only has 1
              hit point left. Net 1 P on Stage 1.</li>
                <li>Travel: none.</li>
                <li>Encounter: none.</li>
                <li>Combat: Faramir defends, Shadow is Necromancer's Pass, for no effect.
              Faramir takes 1 D.  Use Unexpected Courage to get Theodred back up to
              kill King Spider.</li>
                <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>I think this was first round played "perfectly" over all three
              games so far.</p>
              
              <h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Resource: 5, draw Northern Tracker. I hope I can get this
              in play. If so, I may have a chance at getting to Stage 2. I
              should be able to deploy it next turn.</li>
                <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
                <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Eowyn), draw Caught in a Web.
              Attach this to Beravor. Net 1 P on Stage 1 for 3P total.</li>
                <li>Travel: none.</li>
                <li>Encounter: none.</li>
                <li>Combat: none.</li>
                <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>So far so good. Looks like the earliest a hero
              will go out now is going to be Round 6.</p>
              
              <h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Resource: 8, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
                <li>Planning: play Northern Tracker.</li>
                <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker for 6 Will, draw
              Necromancer's Pass. Net +1 P.</li>
                <li>Travel: none.</li>
                <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
                <li>Combat: Guard of the Citadel defends, first Shadow is Tower
              Gate, no effect, second Shadow is Great Forest Web for no effect.
              Guard of the Citadel is toast. Theodred and Faramir attack to
              pkce 2 D on Beastmaster.</li>
                <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>I need a Gandalf about right now.</p>
              
              <h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Resource: 9, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
                <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
                <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Eowyn), Northern Tracker, draw Dol
              Goldur Orcs, deal 2 D to Northern Tracker. I think this is the
              beginning of the end. Net +1 P to Stage 1.</li>
                <li>Travel: none.</li>
                <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
                <li>Combat: Faramir defends Dol Goldur Orcs, Shadow card is
              Cavern Guardian, discard Unexpected Courage. Fuck. No damage on
              Faramir. Guard of the Citadel defends Dol Goldur Beastmaster,
              Shadow Endless Caverns no effect, Guard is destroyed,
              since Theodred cannot refresh, there is no more which can be done.
              That's really bad.</li>
                <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Resource: 11, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
                <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout to get rid of Necromancer's Pass.
              Small relief! This is bad though, 2 enemies engaged.</li>
                <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Eowyn), draw Tower Gate. No problem!
              Net +3. If I could scry I'd be done with this Stage already.</li>
                <li>Travel: none.</li>
                <li>Encounter: none.</li>
                <li>Combat: Faramir defends, Shadow is Dungeon Jailer, no effect
              and no damage on Faramir. Snowbourn Scout defends, first Shadow is
              Mountains of Mirkwood, no effect, second shadow is Dol Goldur Orcs,
              +1 attack, Snowbourn Scout is dead. Nothern Tracker deals 1 D to
              Dol Goldur Beastmaster.</li>
                <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Resource: 15, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
                <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
                <li>Quest: Eowyn and Northern Tracker, draw Necromancer's Reach, which
              destroys Northern Tracker. I'm taking Tower Gate out of play as the
              text on Northern Tracke says place the progress token when Northern
              Tracker commits, so Tower Gate is out of play before I draw. I'm
              bringing it back next turn with Stand and Fight. Net +2 P for 6/9
              total Progress. I need to be able to scry, so badly.</li>
                <li>Travel: none.</li>
                <li>Encounter: none.</li>
                <li>Combat: Faramir defends Dol Goldur Orcs, Shadow is Enchanted Stream
              for no effect and no damage. Dol Goldur Beastmaster on Guard of the
              Citadel, first Shadow is Under the Shadow which raise Theat by 2, which
              I'm canceling via Hasty Stroke. Second Shadow is Iron Shackles which
              resolves to its <em>When Revealed</em>. Unfortunate. Theodred deal 1 D
              to Beastmaster. I really need a Gandalf
              or Galadhrim to reduce threat right about now.</li>
                <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>Ungoliant's Spawn and Hummehorns are still in the deck.</p>
              
              <h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Resource: 16, draw Iron Shackles.</li>
                <li>Planning: play Stand and Fight to bring Northern Tracker
              back into play.</li>
                <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Dol Goldur Orcs, and that's the game. I'll play it
              out to dead hero, but there's no way to survive this now. Net +2 P
              on Stage 1 for 8/9. Really don't want any more progress until
              Threat is reduced.</li>
                <li>Travel: none.</li>
                <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
                <li>Combat: Theodred defends against Dol Goldur Orcs, Shadow is
              Necromancer's Reach for no effect, Theodred is dead.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <p>I think I'm getting a better grip on this scenario now. Getting
              the Staging area and Encounters cleared out as fast as possible, then
              getting through Stage 1 with as low a threat as possible.</p>
              
              <p>In this game, with no Gandalfs and no Galadhrim's Greeting, there
              wasn't any way out. Even one Gandalf a couple of turns back to take
              out the Dol Goldur Beastmaster could have tipped it.</p>
              
              <p>Another thing about this scenario is it doesn't make sense to
              reserve anything at the beginning. If an advantage can be taken
              it needs to be taken as soon as possible.</p>

                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.

                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
