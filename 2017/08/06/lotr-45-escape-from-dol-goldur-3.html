LotR 45 - Escape from Dol Guldur (3)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug  6 2017</time>

<p>Using the "<a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5957/back-to-basics-tri-sphere-1.0">Back
to Basics</a>" deck
for the third play.</p>

<p>So far, I'm finding that this scenario doesn't really reward good play,
but will brutally punish anything less than perfect play. There is no
respite.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Guard of the Citadel</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial Encounter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dungeon Torch has Dol Goldur Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Shadow Key has King Spider.</li>
  <li>Gandalf's Map has Great Forest Web.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Under the Shadow, raise Threat by 1
per player. Net -4 P for Threat 31.</li>
  <li>Travel: none, can't afford to lose Theodred next turn.</li>
  <li>Encounter: King Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Undefended so that Theodred can get in a lick.
Draw Endless Caverns which has no Shadow effect. 3 D for
Theodred, he returns 1 D to Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I should have played Snowbourn Scout, which would have allowed
a chump block for the Kind Spider, as well as putting a P on Great
Forest Web.</p>

<p>It also just occurred to me that I will not be able to attach
Shadow Key to Theodred as he's already out of hit points.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Steward of Gondor on Theodred, exhaust to get 2, then
play Snowbourn Scout. Also play Unexpected Courage on Theodred now that
Eowyn has the resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (put R on Eowyn), draw Eyes of the Forest
which discards all the Event cards from my hand, which is to say,
two copies of Sneak Attack. This is unfortunate, as I was going to use
Sneak Attack to bring in Faramir to kill the King Spider, which will now
survive another turn. This does net 1 P on Stage 1 <em>The Necromancer's
Tower</em>, so I'm doing a little better than Games 1 and 2.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends, Shadow for King Spider is Dol Goldur
Beastmaster for no effect. Theodred deals 1 D to King Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Faramir.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Necromancer's Reach and cancel with
A Test of Will. This would have been game ending as Theodred only has 1
hit point left. Net 1 P on Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir defends, Shadow is Necromancer's Pass, for no effect.
Faramir takes 1 D.  Use Unexpected Courage to get Theodred back up to
kill King Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this was first round played "perfectly" over all three
games so far.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Northern Tracker. I hope I can get this
in play. If so, I may have a chance at getting to Stage 2. I
should be able to deploy it next turn.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Eowyn), draw Caught in a Web.
Attach this to Beravor. Net 1 P on Stage 1 for 3P total.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>So far so good. Looks like the earliest a hero
will go out now is going to be Round 6.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker for 6 Will, draw
Necromancer's Pass. Net +1 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Guard of the Citadel defends, first Shadow is Tower
Gate, no effect, second Shadow is Great Forest Web for no effect.
Guard of the Citadel is toast. Theodred and Faramir attack to
pkce 2 D on Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<p>I need a Gandalf about right now.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Eowyn), Northern Tracker, draw Dol
Goldur Orcs, deal 2 D to Northern Tracker. I think this is the
beginning of the end. Net +1 P to Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir defends Dol Goldur Orcs, Shadow card is
Cavern Guardian, discard Unexpected Courage. Fuck. No damage on
Faramir. Guard of the Citadel defends Dol Goldur Beastmaster,
Shadow Endless Caverns no effect, Guard is destroyed,
since Theodred cannot refresh, there is no more which can be done.
That's really bad.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout to get rid of Necromancer's Pass.
Small relief! This is bad though, 2 enemies engaged.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Eowyn), draw Tower Gate. No problem!
Net +3. If I could scry I'd be done with this Stage already.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir defends, Shadow is Dungeon Jailer, no effect
and no damage on Faramir. Snowbourn Scout defends, first Shadow is
Mountains of Mirkwood, no effect, second shadow is Dol Goldur Orcs,
+1 attack, Snowbourn Scout is dead. Nothern Tracker deals 1 D to
Dol Goldur Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 15, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn and Northern Tracker, draw Necromancer's Reach, which
destroys Northern Tracker. I'm taking Tower Gate out of play as the
text on Northern Tracke says place the progress token when Northern
Tracker commits, so Tower Gate is out of play before I draw. I'm
bringing it back next turn with Stand and Fight. Net +2 P for 6/9
total Progress. I need to be able to scry, so badly.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir defends Dol Goldur Orcs, Shadow is Enchanted Stream
for no effect and no damage. Dol Goldur Beastmaster on Guard of the
Citadel, first Shadow is Under the Shadow which raise Theat by 2, which
I'm canceling via Hasty Stroke. Second Shadow is Iron Shackles which
resolves to its <em>When Revealed</em>. Unfortunate. Theodred deal 1 D
to Beastmaster. I really need a Gandalf
or Galadhrim to reduce threat right about now.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ungoliant's Spawn and Hummehorns are still in the deck.</p>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 16, draw Iron Shackles.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Stand and Fight to bring Northern Tracker
back into play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Dol Goldur Orcs, and that's the game. I'll play it
out to dead hero, but there's no way to survive this now. Net +2 P
on Stage 1 for 8/9. Really don't want any more progress until
Threat is reduced.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Theodred defends against Dol Goldur Orcs, Shadow is
Necromancer's Reach for no effect, Theodred is dead.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I'm getting a better grip on this scenario now. Getting
the Staging area and Encounters cleared out as fast as possible, then
getting through Stage 1 with as low a threat as possible.</p>

<p>In this game, with no Gandalfs and no Galadhrim's Greeting, there
wasn't any way out. Even one Gandalf a couple of turns back to take
out the Dol Goldur Beastmaster could have tipped it.</p>

<p>Another thing about this scenario is it doesn't make sense to
reserve anything at the beginning. If an advantage can be taken
it needs to be taken as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
