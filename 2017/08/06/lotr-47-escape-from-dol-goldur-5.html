  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Theodred), Sneak Attack for
Threat 24, quest with Gandalf for 9 Will, draw Caught in a Web,
put that on Beravor. This clears Great Forest Web and puts 4 P
on Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 25.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gandalf, threat 20.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Gandalf for 9 Will, draw Endless
Caverns which surges for Ungoliant's Spawn. Crap. I was hoping
to get through Stage 1, but not even close and I"ve kind of shot
my wad here.</li>
  <li>Travel: Necromancer's Pass, randomly discard Hasty Stroke and
Galadhrim's Greeting. Ok well that pain is done. Now I just need to
rebuild my resources. I have only three cards left in my hand.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 21.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Lore of Imladris.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Enchanted Stream, discard Lore of
Imladris, net -1 P Threat 22.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 23.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I'm in Location Lock.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Miner of the Iron Hills, which I need to keep.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Eowyn), draw Under the Shadow. Committed 5 Will,
there is 7 Threat in the staging area, +1 for Under the Shadow, Threat
is now 26. Dang. And will be 27 after this round finishes.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. Location locked.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 24.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Henamarth Riversong.</li>
  <li>Planning: Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker, draw Mountains of Mirkwood,
net -3 P, Threat 27. Northern Tracker will help if I can keep him alive
long enough.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Faramir.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Faramir.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker, Faramir for 9 Will, draw
Eyes of the Forest discard Dwarven Tomb. Eowyn discards Henamarth to get
another P on Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29. Ungoliant's Spawn is lurking. That will likely
be the game if it engages.</li>
</ol>

<p>Mistake to not have played Dwarven Tomb to get Galadhrim's Greeting
back in my hand.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout, P on Mountains of Mirkwood.
Things are looking up.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Beravor), Northern Tracker, Snowbourn
Scout, Faramir for 10 Will, draw Mountains of Mirkwood, net +4 P and
Stage 1 is cleared. Dungeon Torch on Theodred.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Will be able to play Miner of the Iron Hills next turn.</p>

<p>Retconned the Dungeon Torch onto Theodred, it would not
have made any other difference in game play, and really just
means Ungoliant's Spawn is coming out at least one round sooner.</p>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Northern Tracker as Beravor is still prisoner.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Eowyn, 5 total R right now), Northern
Tracker x 2, Snowbourn Scout, Faramir for 12 Will. Draw Driven by
Shadow, increases Threat by 3, net +3 on Stage 2 <em>Through the
Caverns</em>. Beravor now is rescued.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. Beravor draws Forest Snare and Will of the West.
This game has possibility.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>I need to find a way to deal with Ungoliant's Spawn real soon now.</p>

<p>Forgot to move Nazgul into Staging area. It has Threat 5. This would
have changed my previous turn somewhat. If I win this one, I'm
considering it "tainted."</p>

<p>I made a mistake somewhere, I didn't get enough R on Beravor to
play Miner of the Iron Hills this turn, which was a big mistake
as I really needed the card draw.</p>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Henamarth Riversong, scry Dol Goldur Orcs, whaddya
know.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R to Beravor), Northern Tracker, Faramir,
Snowbourn Scout. Draw Dol Goldur Orcs net 0 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ungoliant's Spawn and Dol Goldor Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends Ungoliant's Spawn, Shadow Dol Goldur
Orcs for +1 attack, Scout is dead. Northern Tracker defend on Dol Goldur
Orcs, Shadow Necromancer's Reach, no effect and no damage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Will of the West.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Forest Snare on Ungoliant's Spawn. Scry
Great Forest Web, no big deal.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Snowbourn Scout, Faramir, draw
Great Forest Web, net 0 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Northern Tracker defend Dol Goldur Orcs, Shadow draw King
Spider, which means I can't kill it this turn, I have to exhaust
a character which would be one of the Northen Trackers. This sucks
because I need both of them next turn to deal with Great Forest Web.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nazgul is two turns away unless I can lower threat a lot.</p>

<h4 id="round-12">Round 12</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Gleowine. If I can get through the next couple of turns,
I might just have a chance at this.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Miner of Iron Hills. Scry Chieftain Ufthak. Beravor
draws Sneak Attack and Steward of Gondor. I need a Gandalf now. The
Nazgul will be coming into play now I think, I don't see any way to
get around it. Play Steward of Gondor on Eowyn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R on Eowyn), Northern Tracker x 2, Miner of
the Iron Hills, Faramir for 12 Will, draw Chieftain Ufthak, net +4 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Chieftain Ufthak.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends against Chieftain Ufthak, Shadow is
Necromancer's Reach, no effect, Scout dies. Faramir defends against Dol
Goldur Orcs, Shadow card is Necromancer's Pass, no effect and no damage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<p>Getting down to the wire. Dungeon Jailer is coming out next turn.
This is going to be rough. But I think I can do it. The key is taking
out the Nazgul, then playing Will of the West to get some good cards
back into play.</p>

<p>Mistake here: Faramir should not have defended.</p>

<h4 id="round-13">Round 13</h4>

<p>First thing is not to worry about Chieftain Ufthak, because his ass
is snared in a couple of rounds. We'll let him pummel the Snowbourn
Scout this round, maybe a tracker next round.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 18, draw Lore of Imladris.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Gleowine, Gleowine draws Forest Snare, which of course
can't be played because don't have enough Resource for it. Beravor draws
Gandalf and Miner of the Iron Hills. Henamarth scries Tower Gate.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Threodred (R to Beravor). I'm in a bind here.
Everything coming out, I'm going to roll with it. The game breaker
was not being able to put out the Forest Snare on Chieftain Ufthak.
I think it was almost doable had I managed that. I'll play it out to see
how the Nazgul works. Add Northern Tracker to clear Tower Gate. Net 0
Progress. Nazgul doesn't come out, but Dungeon Jailor does.</li>
  <li>Travel: None.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dungeon Jailer.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir defends against Dol Goldur Orcs with Shadow card
Caught in a Web for no effect and no damage. Snowbourn Scout defends
against Chieftain Ufthak, Shadow is Cavern Guardian, need to discard
attachment which will be the Dungeon Torch for some respite. Gandalf
(Sneak Attack) defends against Dungeon Jailor, Shadow is Dol Goldur
Beastmaster for no effect. Ungoliant's Spawn has a Dol Goldur Orcs
Shadow. Attcking back, Miner of Iron Hills destroys Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<p>Mistake here: I thought Dol Guldur Orcs was 4 hits, it's not, it's 3,
I probably could have cleared them out last turn or maybe earlier.</p>

<p>Mistake this turn was made in the previous turn: Steward of Gondor
should have been played on Beravor.</p>

<h4 id="round-14">Round 14</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 19, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gandalf. Scry Dungeon Jailor. Dang. Gleowine draws
Snowbourn Scout, awesome, perfect, play it. Beravor draws Erebor
Hammersmith and Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred (R on Beravor), Eowyn discards Erebor for
extra W, net 0, draw Dungeon Jailor. Now the ugliness begins.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dungeon Jailer, Nazgul.</li>
  <li>Combat, defense:
  * Snowbourn Scout: Nazgul with Shadow Necromancer's Reach for no
  effect, Scout is gone. Discard Gleowine for Nazgul effect.
  * Northern Tracker: Dungeon Jailor with Shadow Iron Shackles,
  put that on the top of the player deck.
  * Northern Tracker: Dungeon Jailer with Shadow card Cavern Guardian
  discard attachment, which would be Steward of Gondor. Crap. Time to
  execute Will of the West.
  * Miner of the Iron Hills: Chieftain Ufthak with Shadow card King
  Spider, which means I need to exhaust a character. Well screw you
  Mr King Spider, I just happen to have someone ready to go. Exhaust
  Faramir.
  * Gandalf takes out the Nazgul.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<p>That was a heck of a turn.</p>

<h4 id="round-15">Round 15</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 18, draw Iron Shackles. Play Will of the West and
reshuffle.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Hummerhorns. OFFS. Beravor draw Lore of Imladris
and Guard of the Citadel. Play Forest Snare on Ufthak. Play Guard
of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, net +3 P for 12/15, draw Hummerhorns. Dang. That
stings.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hummerhorns, remove Beravor.</li>
  <li>Combat: defense:
    <ul>
      <li>Guard of the Citadel: Hummerhorns, with Shadow Mountains of
Mirkwood. Guard is dead.</li>
      <li>Northern Tracker: Dungeon Jailor with Enchanted Stream, no effect.</li>
      <li>Northern Tracker: Dungeon Jailor with Shadow Dol Guldur Beastmaster
for no effect.</li>
      <li>Attack: Theodred and Faramir kill Hummerhorns.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-16">Round 16</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw For Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: scry King Spider.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw King Spider, discard Miner of the Iron Hills, net
+3 which will clear the quest once I acquire the Objectives.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: King Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: defense:
    <ul>
      <li>Northern Tracker: Dungeon Jailor, Shadow Dol Guldur Orcs, +1
attack, net 1 D on Northern Tracker.</li>
      <li>Faramir: Dungeon Jailor with Endless Caverns card for
Shadow, no effect.</li>
      <li>Northern Tracker: King Spider with Shadow Under the Shadow,
Raise Threat by 3 to Threat 45. That's the game unless I can draw
a Gandalf next turn to lower threat and grab objectives. One D
on Northern Tracker.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 46.</li>
</ol>

<p>If it weren't for the <em>Under the Shadow</em> shadow card I drew, I could
have snagged all the Objective cards this round, and quested with
everyone next round to win.</p>

<h4 id="round-17">Round 17</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 15, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: scry Mountains of Mirkwood.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Mountains of Mirkwood.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: same as above, repeated, with result I don't care.</li>
</ol>

<p>Checking the top of the draw deck, I won't get a Gandalf for 4 turns,
there is no reason to continue.</p>

<h3 id="aar">AAR</h3>

<p>There were a number of mistakes in this game which might have resulted
in a win had I been a bit more experienced. I should work through them,
but not right now, it's late and this was grueling.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
