Hoplite, Netrunner and more
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug  7 2017</time>
<p>CC stopped by for a last game day before I start work in a couple
of days. Ramping up at work is going to fill my brain to exclude
much game, so it was nice to have a blowout day before starting.
We played three games in total.</p>

<p>Think Thrice is a small set puzzle game for matching tiles.
The rules are very simple, but it's not clear how to play the
game correctly. I think maybe this isn't a very good game.
We'll play it a few more times I'm sure, but it's not destined
to be a classic in my collection.</p>

<p>Hoplite finally made it to the table with the Mycale battle.
This was overdue, we just hadn't gotten around to it yet. I
played the Greeks under Xanthippus, while CC played the Persians
under Tigranes. Despite the Heroic Xanthippus suffering an arrow
from the Persian Archers, the mighty and noble Athenians led
the Greeks to Victory over Tigranes pusillanimous Persian peasants.
The Spartans watched the action from the comfort and safety
of a nearby hill. Jerks.</p>

<p>Here's the situation at the end:</p>

<p>Android: Netrunner finally hit the table. I've had this for years,
but haven't made it past a single solo learning game. We slogged
our way through it with me taking the Runner faction Sphere with
Kate, and CC taking the Corporate faction Jinteki. After much rules
consulting, I won at the end with 7 Agenda points on 3 cards. I
think we'll play this again, taking the same factions to better
understand the game play.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
