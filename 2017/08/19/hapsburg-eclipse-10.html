<p>Game 10 for Hapsburg Eclipse! Finishing this game gets me another dime
for the year, one that was a goal.</p>

<p>From <a href="2017/08/19/hapsburg-eclipse-9.html">Game 9</a> I found that I had
been playing the Premszyl Fortress wrong by scoring the double Strategic
Sites flags before the fortress was completely destroyed. In this game,
I do not intend on making that same mistake. I may well make other
mistakes, but hopefully not that one.</p>

<p>Being that I'm a bit burned out on this game, I'm just going to play the
cards as they come up and see what happens. Also, I'm going to play the
helpful markers right away to attempt to stave off collapse.</p>

<p>I think I've been using German Staff operations incorrectly as well.
These apparently allow an extra, "Reserve" action during a turn, with
the +1 DRM. It's not really extra, it takes two actions to acquire one.
It's more like postponing actions for later. Still not sure these are
really useful.</p>

<p><strong>German Staff Operations: Once placed in a theatre they provide a
permanent +1 DRM each, unless they're spent for a "Reserve" action.
I've been Doing It Wrong.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>35</code> German Aid. This card is a waste of action to be pulled on
Turn 1. There is nothing to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>07</code> Drina Campaign. Defeat. Acquire German Staff Operations (GSO).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>05</code> Battle of Tannenburg. Victory. Polish pushed back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11</code> Putnik Reclaims Belgrade. Defeat. Carpathian pushed back
to space 6.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>09</code> Battle of the Falkland Islands. Victory. Purchase another GSO.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13</code> Czechoslovak Legion. Czeck Revolt. All Actions fail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10</code> German 9th Army. Czech back out of Revolt. NW 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>06</code> Russian Cipher Cracked. Carpathian and Czech pushed back.
NW 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15</code> Treaty of London. Purchase another GSO. Action fails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>18</code> Von Lettow-Vorbeck. Victory. NW +1, first time I can remember.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12</code> Battle of Dogger Bank. Defeat. Polish pushed back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>29</code> Otranto Barrage. Victory. NW +1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>14</code> Gallipolli Campaign. Defeat. GSO purchased. I see how I can use
these later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>26</code> Fighting in the Trentino. Victory. Action fails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>03</code> Battle of Cer. Defeat. Purchase GSO. Action fails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>30</code> Nivelle Offensive. Defeat. Anything but a natural 1 would have
won this battle, so I rolled a natural 1. Polish pushed back. Carpathian
canceled with Radio Intercepts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>22</code> Romania Joins Allies. Massive offensive failures. NW -3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>34</code> Hungarian Food Shortages. NW -4. Egad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>21</code> Brusilov Offensive. Czech Revolt. Hungarian Support -2.
I'm pretty sure that's the game…totalling up…NW -7.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aar">AAR</h3>

<p>Another loss. I'm 1/10 on this game, and I'm pretty sure my win was
tainted as it was my second game. Barely beat my average of 17 cards.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
