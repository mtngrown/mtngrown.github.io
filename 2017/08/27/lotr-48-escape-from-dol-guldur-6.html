LotR 48 - Escape from Dol Guldur (6)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 27 2017</time>

<p>Using the "<a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5957/back-to-basics-tri-sphere-1.0">Back
to Basics</a>" deck
for a 6th attempt at the horribly difficult scenario.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Miner of the Iron Hills</li>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>Northern Tracker</li>
  <li>Lore of Imladris</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial encounter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dungeon Torch/Driven by Shadow</li>
  <li>Gandalf's Map/Dol Guldur Beastmaster</li>
  <li>Shadow Key/ Dungeon Jailer</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred draw Tower Gate for net 0.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is ok, I'll have enough to get Northern Tracker out next turn
to eliminate Tower Gate from the staging area. Actually that's wrong as
I need 4 Spirit to get Northern Tracker into play, so it will be a
couple of turns. Hope I can last that long.</p>

<p>I think I'll start knocking out a few chores along the way here.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, save resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn and Theodred, draw Great Forest Road, and Eowyn now has
3 R, so Northern Tracker comes out next turn to deal with these
locations. Net -2 for Threat 30. I'm going to need threat control
very soon now.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Northern Tracker next round!</p>

<p>Laundry all folded now.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Quest: Northern Tracker, Eowyn draw King Spider and now the game
starts to go pear shaped. Will exhaust Snowbourn in an attempt to save
Snowbourn for the next round blocking. Threat 33.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: King Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Theodred defends, Shadow is Great Forest Web for no effect.
Theodred takes 2 hits.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is looking ugly. Maybe should have played Gandalf to lower threat
when I had the chance.</p>

<p><strong>A Test of Will would have negated King Spider's "When Revealed"
effect, if only I had a spare Resource to spend for it.</strong></p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Gandalf to reduce Threat to 29.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Northern Tracker, Theodred draw Cavern Guardian, net 1
P on Stage 1. Threat 30. I think this game just went unwinnable.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Cavern Guardian.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn defends Cavern Guardian, Shadow is Caught in a Web,
no effect but Snowbourn is toast. Gandalf defends King Spider, Shadow is
Mountains of Mirkwood, no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tense game now.</p>

<p>Got the Hinge Health tablet and sensors charging.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Stand and fight to put Snowbourn back into play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Under the Shadow, Threat 32.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn defend King Spider Shadow Necromancer's Reach for
no effect, Snowbourn back to discard. Northern Tracker defends Cavern
Guardian, Shadow is Endless Caverns for no effect, and no damage on
Northern Tracker. Theodred deals 1 D to King Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unexpected Courage onto Theodred next round.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: Unexpected Courage on Theodred.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Dol Guldur Orcs, since Eowyn has 1 R
from Theodred, the 1 D When Revealed can be negated with A Test of Will.
Net 0 progress and going into enemy lock.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Ready Theodred. Eowyn takes undefended from Dol Guldur Orcs,
Shadow Dungeon Jailer for no effect, 2 D on Eowyn. Northern Tracker
defends King Spider, Shadow is Chieftain Ufthak for no effect, 1 D on
Northern Tracker. Theodred defends Cavern Guardian, Shadow is Enchanted
Stream, no effect +1 D on Theodred.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>This game is basically unwinnable at this point, I've completely lost
control of staging and encounter, and there is no way to deal with the
number of enemies I have right now, much less what's coming. A bad
Treachery could take out both Eowyn and Theodred.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw For Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Dol Guldur Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: n/m, questing Eowyn lost a defender there, this is game over
because she's out on this combat round.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aar">AAR</h3>

<p>The key to this quest is getting control of staging as fast as
possible. If Treachery and Location cards come up for Objective guards,
and Northern Tracker comes out early, this would be really helpful.</p>

<p>It's a pity the designers didn't handicap this scenario to be winnable
with a solo hand.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
