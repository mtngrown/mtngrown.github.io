LotR 49 - Escape from Dol Guldur (7)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 27 2017</time>
<p>Using the "<a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5957/back-to-basics-tri-sphere-1.0">Back
to Basics</a>" deck
for a 7th attempt.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Northern Tracker</li>
  <li>Henamarth Riversong</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>For Gondor</li>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial Encounter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dungeon Torch/Dungeon Jailor</li>
  <li>Gandalf's Map/Necromancer's Pass</li>
  <li>Shadow Key/Mountains of Mirkwood</li>
</ol>

<p>If I can get Northern Tracker out fast, I might have a shot at this one.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2, draw Dwarven Tomb.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Caught in a Web, put that on Beravor. Threat 29.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw The Galadhrim's Greeting.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Snowbourn Scout, 1 P on Necromancer's Pass.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn &amp; Theodred, draw Chieftain Ufthak threat 33.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Snowbourn Scout, useful!</li>
  <li>Planning: Snowbourn Scout to clear Necromancer's Pass. Galadhrim's
Greeting to reduce threat to 28.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred draw King Spider, exhaust Snowbourn Scout.
Threat 30.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: King Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends, Shadow Great Forest Web, no effect.
Snowbourn is dead.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Dol Guldur Beastmaster, Threat 34.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat:  Snowbourn Scout defends, Shadow is Great Forest Web for no
effect. Sneak Attack Gandalf to kill King Spider, Threat 29.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Northern Tracker draw Endless Caverns which is Doomed 1
and surge Iron Shackles. Threat 32.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can't get a grip on the staging. I'm gaining extra threat every turn
because I can't quest enough to beat the staging area. This is all going
to collapse when the enemies pour out at threat 35.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Iron Shackles.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker draw Dungeon Jailor.
Threat 35.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Chieftain Ufthak, Dol Guldur Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Combat: Guard of Citadel defends Chieftain Ufthak, dies. Shadow card
was Dol Guldur Orcs. Theodred takes undefended Dol Guldur Beastmaster, Shadow
cards Driven by Shadow and The Necromancer's Reach both for no effect,
takes 3 D.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Dwarven Tomb to fetch The Galadhrim's Greeting, play
to reduce threat to 30.</li>
  <li>Quest: Northern Tracker, draw Ungoliant's Spawn. Mountains of
Mirkwood is clear, but Threat is 34, which will bring Ungoliant's
Spawn into play. Bummer.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I called it because it was obvious I was about to lose all my heroes.
Would rather save a few minutes and do something else.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
