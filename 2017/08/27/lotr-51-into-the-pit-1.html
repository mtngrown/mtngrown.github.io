LotR 51 - Into the Pit (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 27 2017</time>
<p>Using the basic trisphere deck just to get started on <em>Into the Pit</em> as
I'm kind of bored with Escape from Dol Guldur, and Return to Mirkwood
has a reputation almost as bad for solo play. So Khazad Dum here we
come. At some point I'll put together a pure dwarf deck for the Khazad
Dum quests, but not today.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Gleowine</li>
</ol>

<p>Not a great hand maybe, but let's see how it works.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Beravor draw Zigil Mineshaft, threat 5,
so 0 net progress on East Gate. Play Sneak Attack with Gandalf
for Threat 22, +4 P on East Gate.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 23.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout with P on Zigil. Play Gandalf
for Threat 18.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Eowyn, Gandalf, Beravor for Will 11, draw Dark and
Dreadful, 1 D to everyone. Net 4 which clears East Gate.</li>
  <li>Travel: First Hall, Threat 21.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 22.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Dwarben Tomb.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Beravor for 6 Will, draw Crumbling Ruin,
which discards one of my Snowbourn Scouts. Now I have an Action Window
after revealing, before Quest resolution, so I'm going to spend 1 and
use Stand and Fight to bring this Snowbourn Scout back into play, which
will add one more P to Zigil. Now I'm going to spend 3 Threat to clear
Zigil Mineshaft from staging. This puts me at Threat 25. That clears
First Hall and puts 2 more on <em>Entering the Mines</em>.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 26.</li>
</ol>

<p>I need to get the card drawing going.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gleowine and Guard of Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Guard of Citadel for 7 Will, draw Signs of
Conflict Doom 2 for Threat 28 and surge Signs of Conflict Threat 30 and
surge Stairs of Nain. Dang. So much for threat control. Net 3 P to
clear <em>Bridge of Khazad Dum</em>.</li>
  <li>Travel: Goblin Tunnels, too risky to leave it there. Beravor draws Will
of the West and Forest Snare.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I hadn't run my threat very low at the beginning, I'd be close to
losing from Threat 50. already.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Guard of Citadel x 2 for 7 Will, draw
Branching Paths. Net +4 P on Goblin Tunnels.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. Beravor draws Faramir and Stand and Fight, Gleowine
draws Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Steward of Gondor on Eowyn, play Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker, Guard of Citadel x 2 for
8 Will, draw Fouled Well, dang, just needed 1 more to clear Goblin
Tunnels. This could be costly. I'm retconning Gleowine into this quest,
which will clear Goblin Tunnels. <strong>Actually, I should have discarded
something for Eowyn, which would be legit. I knew there was something
I was missing.</strong></li>
  <li>Travel: Branching Paths. Beravor draws Hasty Stroke and Gleowine.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Mistake: I played this wrong regardless, Branching Paths adds +1
Threat to all Dark locations in Staging area, which I did not do.
No big deal, I won't count this as a clean win.</strong></p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker, Guard x 2, Gleowine and
draw Lightless Passage. Discard extra Gleowine to get 10 for +1 P on
Branching Paths. I'm missing these locations by 1 P consistently.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. Beravor draws Miner of the Iron Hills and extra
Faramir.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>Need to do some threat control here.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake: forgot to trigger Steward of Gondor this round.</strong></p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Henamarth Riversong.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Henamarth Riversong and Faramir, Gandalf for
Threat 29. Henamarth scries Burning Low, which we'll cancel with
A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Gandalf, Guard x 2, Northern Tracker, draw
Burning Low and cancel with A Test of Will. Need to exhaust Faramir
to bring 18 to clear Stage 1. Goblin Patrol Leader in Staging.</li>
  <li>Travel: Fouled Well. Beravor draws Steward of Gondor and Northern
Tracker. Gleowine draws Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Patrol Leader, we'll draw him out this turn and snare him
next turn.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends, Shadow Branching Paths no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout. Scry Goblin Follower. Play
Northern Tracker. Play Forest Snare.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker x 2, Guard of Citadel x 2,
which clears both locations from Staging area. On to Stage 3, where
we find out we don't collect Resources, which I don't think matters for
me now given the huge questing I can muster.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. Beravor draws Lore of Imladris and The Galadhrim's
Greeting, Gleowine draws Miner of the Iron Hill.s</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2, draw Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Watchful Eyes.</li>
  <li>Quest: Everybody for 22 Will, and that's the game.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aar">AAR</h3>

<p>This was an easier quest than I thought it would be.</p>

<p>Also, this deck freakin' rocks.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
