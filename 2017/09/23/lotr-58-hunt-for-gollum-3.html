<p>I was in Berkeley visiting a friend at a programming meetup,
and stopped by CCB afterward for a quick game of LotR.</p>

<p>Our quest for the day was The Hunt for Gollum. I've played this single
handed a couple of times and beaten it both times, possibly even
legitimately. It seemed like the next thing to do. Since CC enjoys the
game, I suspect we'll play a fair number of the quests. It also seems
reasonable to do these quests in release order, so I'll need to build
some decks for Escape from Dol Guldur.</p>

<p>In any case, we tackled The Hunt for Gollum using the same decks built
for Journey along the Anduin. It went fairly well overall, especially
after getting Beravor and Gleowine steadily drawing every turn. The
Northern Trackers never came out, so we ended up dealing with relatively
high threat through most of the game, as the X location came out twice
to punish us with 6 and 8 Threat respectively.</p>

<p>We got to Stage 3 without CC having a Clue card, which was bad because
he couldn't quest, and there were a lot of locations in Staging. I
managed to deal with this with a Sneak Attack/Gandalf on the first turn,
and playing Gandalf on the next. The an Evil Storm showed up, putting
damage on the heroes with the Clues, sending the clues back to the
Encounter Deck and cycling the quest card back to 2B. This time, CC
was able to collect a clue card and with the amount of quest we had on
the table, we blew through stage 2B…expect another Evil Storm showed
up…which CC canceled with Test of Will. The next round, same thing:
Evil Storm and amazingly, another Test of Will! So we got the win in the
end, with my threat at 49. Very close game and I'm frankly surprised we
won it.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
