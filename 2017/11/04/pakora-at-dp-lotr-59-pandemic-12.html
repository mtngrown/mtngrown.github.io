<p>CC stopped by for a couple of games.</p>

<p>We kicked off with "Escape from Dol Guldur," (Game 8) using decks I built from
Progression series IIRC. Caleb played Leadership/Spirit, I played
Tactics/Lore. Eowyn was the hero which was captured.</p>

<p>Right out of the gate we got hit with Necromancer's Reach 3 times in the
first few turns, which put loads of damage on heroes. That was bad,
reducing ability to take on enemies later in the game.  We managed to
get through the Nazgul and a load of orcs and whatnot. However, we
ended up in location lock with Ungoliant Spwan, Chieftain Ufthak and a
couple of orcs on the board, which put us out with Threat 50.</p>

<p>I think we did pretty well overall though. This was the first game
CC has lost, so that was good. We had gotten pretty luck on the first
three games we played.</p>

<p>In between games I whipped up a batch of pakora using Hari Ghotra's
recipe (youtube). This ended up taking a lot of me, as I was almost too
tired to care about playing any more.</p>

<p>Pandemic was next; we (CC) set up the "In the Lab" expansion while I
finished up the pakora, then tried to look interested in the game while
we (CC) figured out the Lab rules. It turns out the Lab rules are pretty
interesting. I don't quite understand how they work yet, but despite
being exhausted and (relatively) disinterested, I'd like to figure out
how to beat the Lab game. Really seems to bring a lot cool twists to the
game.</p>

<p>That was all I had for the evening and went to bed right after.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
