<p>Played a couple of fast games of Silver Bayonet, the LZ-Albany Scenario #5.</p>

<p>The first game I was FWA. The PAVN attempted to maneuver combat, which
turned out to be at 1-1, and they did not roll well, obtaining <code>1A4F</code>
result. That was essentially the game for them.</p>

<p>The second game I took the PAVN, and I think I figured this one out.
The initial attack was an assault, then I moved around the LZ to get a
maneuver combat at 2-1 odds, with about 30% chance of forcing a retreat,
if I understand the rules correctly.</p>

<p>I need to play this scenario again taking really good notes. It would be
fun to work out the probabilities.</p>

<h3 id="dien-bien-phu">Dien Bien Phu</h3>

<p>From played games list: Broke out some vintage Indochina action with the
usual opponent. I played the French. The Viet Minh went all in for Hanoi
in Turn 3, and the French were unable to recapture in Turn 4 on a 1-1
battle. Which was good for VM as that was the extent of their supplies
and the I would have had them on the run had I retaken Hanoi. This was
before we read the rule stating French don't have to retreat from
cities.</p>

<p>This is an interesting little game, with a lot of potential. It reminds
me a little of Tonkin zoomed out, same sort of very hard choices. Would
be great to see it redone to modern standards. I'd buy that.</p>

<p>Interesting little game, reminded me a bit of Tonkin (2d Edition) zoomed
out. Surprised it's not already on this list.</p>

<p>From Paint It Black list:</p>

<p>This falls right into the same slot as Fall of South Vietnam: small
footprint, fast playing, exposes major strategic concerns, and would
greatly benefit from a total makeover.</p>

<p>In our game, Hanoi fell in the 4th turn (of 14), which was probably a
good thing for the VM, as it exhausted all their supply. I suspect most
games would go to a draw, perhaps a slight edge to the VM.</p>

<p>Hesitate to recommended for general consumption, probably a must for the
French Indochina connoisseur.</p>

<h3 id="the-agents">The Agents</h3>

<p>Taught AS the rules and we played one game. Did not use the Commanders
for this game. He liked it, so it's going into rotation with him at
least.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
