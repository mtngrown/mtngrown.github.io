LotR 61 - Return to Mirkwood (4)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 25 2017</time>
<p>After <em>another</em> several month hiatus, trying Return to Mirkwood again, and again
with <a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/69888">Beorn's Path 9 Return to Mirkwood deck</a>.</p>

<p>I am not getting to play nearly as much as I would like, career
commitments are trumping all game-related activity.</p>

<p>Here's the initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Escort from Edoras</li>
  <li>Eagles of the Misty Mountains</li>
  <li>The Eagles are Coming!</li>
  <li>Eagles of the Misty Mountains</li>
  <li>Gondorian Spearman</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
</ol>

<p>Kind of a weird hand, but I'm going to keep it.</p>

<p>The Encounter deck served up Despair, no effect.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Quick Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, save the resources</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Gollum's Bite, deal 4 D to
Gimli. Ouch. Net +5 Progress on Through the Forest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resources: 6, draw West Road Traveler.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Woodman's Glade, net +3 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Woodman's Glade, exhaust Gimli.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Need to play Gandalf next turn for Threat reduction and questing.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resources: 7, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gandalf, reduce to 32 Threat.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Gandalf, draw Mirkwood Bats which are
dealt with by Thalin right away. Net 9, Through the Forest is
clear, start into Escape Attempt.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Eagles of the Misty Mountains.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, save resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Gollum's Anguish, raise to 40 Threat.
Net +5 Progress, clear <em>Escape Attempt</em>, start <em>To the Elvin
King's Halls</em>. This sucks, I can't play cards from my hand, so
unless I get very, very lucky, this would be the game.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 44.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this is the game, I need to get a couple of questing
characters out before getting to Stage 3.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Marsh Adder, Thalin puts 1 D on it.
Net +2 on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Marsh Adder.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gondorian Spearman defends which puts another D on Marsh
Adder, Shadow card Mountains of Mirkwood, no effect, Gondorian
Spearman dies. Gimli swings for 6, kills Marsh Adder.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 48.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to pull the next card anyway, just to see what happens.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Song of Travel.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Spider's Ring, net +2 Progress,
this is just not going to happen, bummer.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Threat: 52.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's a wrap. This is a really hard quest to beat single handed.
I think it needs to be mulliganed for Galadhrim's Greetings or
something.</p>

<p>But I think I did pretty well all in all.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
