LotR 62 - Return to Mirkwood (5)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 25 2017</time>
<p>Once again, unto the the breach with
<a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/69888">Beorn's Path 9 Return to Mirkwood deck</a>.</p>

<p>It turns out that I've been playing the deck short one Galadhrim's
Greetings, which may not seem like much, but even a small chance of
threat reduction in this quest can make or break it.</p>

<p>Let's see what the initial hand looks like after initial
mulligan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quick Strike</li>
  <li>Eagles of the Misty Mountains</li>
  <li>Gondorian Spearman</li>
  <li>The Eagles Are Coming!</li>
  <li>Horn of Gondor</li>
  <li>Citadel Plate</li>
</ol>

<p>Not great, but let's roll with it anyway.</p>

<p>Initial Encounter draw is Wood Elf.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Horn of Gondor on Thalin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Mountains of Mirkwood. Net +2
on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: Wood Elf Path.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Eyes of the Forest, discard Quick Strike,
Stand and Fight, The Eagles Are Coming! Net +3 Progress. Wood Elf Path
cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: Mountains of Mirkwood, draw The Spider's Ring.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hrm. Not looking too hot. I'll do another round then start watering the
plants.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw West Road Traveler.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gandalf, Threat 32.</li>

Ancient Mathom to hand.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Spider's Ring.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not doing so well, not making enough progress.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Winged Guardian.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Ancient Mathom on The Spider's Ring.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Woodman's Glade, net +3

clearing Woodman's Glade.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 44.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Galadhrim's Greetings for Threat 38.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Mirkwood Bats which have no effect
due to Thalin, net +3 on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Eagles of the Misty Mountains.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Eagles, draw Attercop Attercop. Dang.
Net +3, need 1 more to clear quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Attercop, Attercop.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends against Attercop, draw Shadow Wasted
Provisions, discarding Vassal of the Windlord, Stand and Fight,
Song of Travel, Hasty Stroke, Ancient Mathom. Dang. Gimli takes
6 Damage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 46.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gondorian Spearman and Gandalf, Threat 41.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Goblin Sniper, net +1 and Stage 1
is cleared!</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Attercop is engaged…</li>
  <li>Combat: Gandalf defends, and is dealt a blow, but he is leaving
anyway, and Horn of Gondor gets us 1 R. Gimli and Gondorian swing
for 9, killing Attercop. Goblin Sniper puts a D on Eagles of the
Misty Mountains.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 45.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Escort from Edoras.</li>
  <li>Planning: Winged Guardian.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Eagles, draw Mirkwood Bats. Net +3
Progress clears the quest, but I don't have enough cards
down… maybe a mistake, but threat is so high I had little
choice other than to quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Sniper.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gondorian Spearman defends, puts 1 D killing
Goblin Sniper.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 49.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Ancient Mathom.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Ancient Mathom.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn + 1, Thalin, Eagles, Gimli, draw Wasted Provisions
discard 10(!) cards from top of deck: Gondorian Spearman, Dwarven Tomb,
Hasty Stroke, Unexpected Courage, Song of Travel, West Road Traveler,
Quick Strike, Escort from Edoras, Feint, Escort from Edoras. Dang.
But quested with 10, need 9 to clear Stage 3, so we're off to Stage 4
which is <em>Ambush</em>. Sadly, I am going to exceed 50 Threat, otherwise
this would be a win.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 53.</li>
</ol>

<p>I played this one pretty well I think.</p>

<p>Some places I think I could have done better:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Not taking a resource when first Gandalf left play for the Horn of
Gondor. One resource can make a really big difference. This is a
definite blunder.</li>
  <li>Horn of Gondor probably should have gone onto Eowyn instead of
Thalin.</li>
  <li>Probably should have gotten Escort From Edoras out early enough to
get me through Stage 1 one turn earlier. With this deck, I was one
turn from beating the quest.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, this is definitely doable.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
