LotR 63 - Return to Mirkwood (6)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 26 2017</time>
<p>Back in the saddle with <a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/69888">Beorn's Path 9 Return to Mirkwood
deck</a>.</p>

<p>I'm dealing with my work inbox at the moment, this game will alleviate
that suffering.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Gondorian Spearman</li>
  <li>Swift Strike</li>
  <li>The Eagles Are Coming!</li>
  <li>Song of Travel</li>
  <li>Feint</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke</li>
</ol>

<p>Not super great, but I'll take anyway.</p>

<p>Initial encounter is Attercop Attercop.</p>

<p>Ok, that's essentially game over for single handed play, so I'm going to
roll that back into the deck and draw again: Wood Elf Path, much better.
Actually, Attercop doesn't come out until Threat 44, so it might have
been worth playing it through.</p>

<p>Actually, no, Attercop automatically engages the player guarding Gollum
regardless of threat.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: draw Song of Travel.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Song of Travel on Thalin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Gollum's Bite dealing 4 D to Gimli.
Net +5 on quest with Song of Travel discard.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Guideline 401k is set up. I should read more about what funds they are
investing in.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Escort from Edoras.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Escort from Edoras and Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Escort, draw Wolf Rider and Attercop Attercop.
Net +6 on quest with discard The Eagles Are Coming!, almost had it.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wolf Riders.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gondorian Spearman defends, which eliminates Wolf Rider.
Shadow card is Goblin Sniper, good to get that one out of the way.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Replied an email from a service provided with thanks and happy
holidays. Three emails left in inbox.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Stand and Fight, good for getting Escort for
Edoras back into play.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Marsh Adder. That's bad, threat 3, time
to play Stand and Fight, which will clear <em>Through the Forest</em>. I
need some card draw.</li>
  <li>Travel: Wood Elf path, need to slow down the questing a little to
get more allies out.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is probably the game, as I have too much threat to prevent the
Marsh Adder from coming into play, and not enough resources to get
Allies out fast enough.</p>

<p>Thank you email off to Bishop Fox. Two emails remaining.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Song of Travel.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Wasted Provisions and discard
A Test of Will, Vassal of the Windlord, Vassal of the Windlord, The
Eagles Are Coming!, A Test of Will, Hasty Stroke, Vassal of the
Windlord, Escort from Edoras, Ancient Mathom, Citadel Plate. Not
too bad, no Gandalfs and no Galadhrim's Greetings were lost.
Net 0 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Marsh Adder.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gondorian Spearman defending, Shadow Woodman's Glade no
effect, Gondorian Spearmn is dead. Gimli swings for 6 to kill
Marsh Added. Threat raised to 42.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 46.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you email to another provider, one email left: set up options
grant.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw West Road Traveler.</li>
  <li>Planning: play West Road Traveler.</li>
  <li>Quest</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Stop the presses!</em></p>

<p>I just saw that Attercop automatically engages the player guarding
Gollum regardless of threat. So this game would have been done as soon
as Attercop came out.</p>

<p>Bummer!</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
