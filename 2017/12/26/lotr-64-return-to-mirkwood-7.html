LotR 64 - Return to Mirkwood (7)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 26 2017</time>
<p>Since <a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/69888">Beorn's Path 9 Return to Mirkwood
deck</a> seems to be working fairly
well, let's continue with it.</p>

<p>In the previous game, I had intended on getting through my entire work
email inbox, but I didn't quite finish that up due to an unfortunate
incident with an Attercop.</p>

<p>Since that game was relatively short, let's try another game. With only
one email remaining in my work inbox, I'll have to shift to dishes and
other cleanup between rounds.</p>

<p>Here is the initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
  <li>Song of Travel</li>
  <li>Song of Travel</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Escort from Edoras</li>
</ol>

<p>Looks ok, I'll keep it.</p>

<p>Encounter: Wolf Rider, surge with Great Forest Web.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Escort from Edoras.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Unexpected Courage on Gimli, Song of Travel on Thalin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowy, Thalin, Gimli, draw Hill Troll. Bummer. Net +4 on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wolf Rider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Wolf Rider undefended, The Spider's Ring, which becomes the
active location, another bummer. 2 D on Gollum. Gimli swings for 2
killing Wolf Rider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Work inbox is completely empty, time to do dishes.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Escort from Edoras as a blocker. I don't see
I can win this one, I don't see how I can get past the Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw The Brown Lands for Threat 37.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Combat: Escort from Edoras defends, Shadow Gollum's Anguish which
raises my threat to 41, Escort is killed, no damage on Hill Troll
because Gimli only swinging for 2 right now.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 45. (!)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not looking good at all.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Gimli, draw Mirkwood Bats, net 0.</li>
  <li>Travel: at The Spider's Lair.</li>
  <li>Encounter: engaged with Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli readies and defends, Shadow Mirkwood Bats for
no effect, Hill Troll puts 4 Damage on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 49.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not good at all. Time to start going through my personal email.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Swift Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gandalf, Threat 44.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw King Spider, discard Swift Strike to
quest with 6, Threat now 47.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's the game as I have no way to reduce threat this round, and
no card draws for the round.</p>

<p>I think this game was a little more brutal than average.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
