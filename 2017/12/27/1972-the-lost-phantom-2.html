1972 The Lost Phantom (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 27 2017</time>
<p>After my surprise win on my first game of this, I've decided I need to
take another spin.</p>

<p>I doubt I will be as lucky the second time around, but we'll see.</p>

<h4 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Mapping: roll 2 which is jungle-hill-jungle.</li>
  <li>Encounter: roll 25, none.</li>
  <li>Dice allocation: 2-2-2.</li>
  <li>Move: south to jungle, roll 6, take 1 health.</li>
  <li>Stealth: 3, 5 success.</li>
  <li>Rest: 4, 2 success.</li>
</ol>

<p>A relatively successful turn, didn't make much forward progress,
but neither went backwards.</p>

<p>Stats: 6-6-5.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Mapping: roll 6, paddy-village-paddy.</li>
  <li>Encounter: roll 64, find map with open field three hexes away.</li>
  <li>Dice: 2-2-2.</li>
  <li>Move: 5, 3 success, move to paddy.</li>
  <li>Stealth: 4, 4 success.</li>
  <li>Rest: 5, 3 success.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another relatively successful turn.</p>

<p>Stats: 6-6-5.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Mapping: roll 1, jungle-swamp-swamp.</li>
  <li>Encounter: roll 36, no effect.</li>
  <li>Dice: 2-2-2.</li>
  <li>Move: roll 6,1 health to 4.</li>
  <li>Stealth: 3, 2, reroll since moved, 6, proximity 5.</li>
  <li>Rest: roll 5, 4 success.</li>
</ol>

<p>Gotta watch the health.</p>

<p>Stats: 5-6-4.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Mapping: roll 6, paddy-village-paddy.</li>
  <li>Encounter: roll 11, Flash Flood, retreat to previous hex.</li>
  <li>Dice: 2-2-2.</li>
  <li>Move: roll 6, 4, choose 4 to succeed.</li>
  <li>Stealth: 2, 1, reroll 1, proximity 4.</li>
  <li>Rest: roll 6, 3, reroll 3 for 4, success.</li>
</ol>

<p>Starting to get a bit nervous here.</p>

<p>Stats: 4-6-4.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Mapping: nothing open.</li>
  <li>Encounter: roll 46, no effect.</li>
  <li>Dice: 2-2-2.</li>
  <li>Move: 3, 1 for no movement.</li>
  <li>Stealth: 6,4 choose 4.</li>
  <li>Rest: 3, 2 lose 1 endurance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Stats: 4-5-4.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Mapping: nothing open.</li>
  <li>Encounter: 36, no effect.</li>
  <li>Dice: 2-1-2.</li>
  <li>Move: 5, 1 success.</li>
  <li>Stealth: 2, proximity 3.</li>
  <li>Rest: 6, 6, reroll 6, endurance back to 6 health to 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>Stats: 3-6-3.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Mapping: roll 4, clear-jungle-hill</li>
  <li>Encouner: Crash Huey per above, grab Flare Gun.</li>
  <li>Dice: 2-2-2.</li>
  <li>Move: 6, 3 reroll 4, move to jungle.</li>
  <li>Stealth: roll 4, 4 success.</li>
  <li>Rest: 6, 1 reroll 5, success.</li>
</ol>

<p>Stats: 3-6-3.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Mapping: roll 2, jungle-hill-jungle.</li>
  <li>Encounter: 62, Crashed Huey, already have Flare Gun and 6 Endurance.</li>
  <li>Dice: 2-2-2.</li>
  <li>Move: 5, 3 success.</li>
  <li>Stealth: 4, 4 success.</li>
  <li>Rest: 6, 1, reroll 1, lose 1 health.</li>
</ol>

<p>Stats: 3-6-2.</p>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Mapping: roll 4, clear-jungle-hill.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Flash Flood, go back.</li>
  <li>Dice: 2-2-2.</li>
  <li>Move: 6, 1 health at 1.</li>
  <li>Stealth: 6, 3 reroll 3, health 0 and that's the game.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I've been taking all 6's, but I now figured out I didn't have to do
that. For example, suppose I rolled 6, 6 for a move. I could choose not
to move, in which case the 6 for losing health would not apply.</p>

<p>Also, I need to play the odds a bit better on allocation. 2-2-2 isn't
always going to be optimal.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
