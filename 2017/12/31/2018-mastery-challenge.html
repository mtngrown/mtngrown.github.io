2018 Mastery Challenge
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 31 2017</time>
<p>For the third year running, I'm creating a Mastery Challenge. While
I never seem to achieve the goals I set at the start of the year,
these challenges have served me well in the past by helping me
focus on getting better at the games I enjoy.</p>

<p>Here are the challenges from 2016 and 2017:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/2016/12/31/2017-mastery-challenge.html">2017 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2015/12/31/2016-challenge.html">2016 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to career commitments, I have no goals for 2018.</p>

<p><strong>2018-12-30</strong>: Current average plays for count of owned games: <code>718 / 103 = 6.96</code>.</p>

<h3 id="section">2018-12-29</h3>

<p>The year is a few days from over. It went reasonably well overall in
terms of game playing activity. This needs to be in context of
deliberately attempting to get 12 hours/day in the office, at least 3
days per week (10-11 hours otherwise). I'm not required to work these
hours, but doing so is ramping my skill set up at 1.5x speed because I'm
pursuing this deliberately.</p>

<p>I was able to get to H-index 13 this year, as anticipated. Getting to 14
next year could be relatively trivial, but as with this year and last,
I'll almost surely spend some time setting up for H-index 15 and beyond.
This means playing a lot of games with 10 or more plays to get them to
13, and playing a few others to bump them into range for a future year.
For example Phantom Leader Deluxe is at 5 plays. If I got in 5 plays
this year, then in 2020 I'd be well positioned to get another 5 plays
to count for H-index 15. This is reasonable as the game lends itself to
campaign play.</p>

<p>In any case, it wasn't a bad year, and if next year goes as well I'll be
quite happy.</p>

<h3 id="section-1">2018-06-03</h3>

<p>As anticipated, this has been a relatively slow game year so far, and
will likely continue to be a relatively slow year. There are a number of
small goals which could be pursued through the end of the year, but it
won't be possible to acheive all of them.</p>

<p>The main choice is whether to pursue depth by increasing H-index,
nickels, dimes and second plays, or increase breadth by knocking out
some of my unplayed games. H-index can get to 13 pretty easily by
playing any of a half dozen games once or twice each. I'm leaning
towards StarForce twice and Vietnam Solitaire twice. These are both at
11 plays, and getting them to 13 also makes them easy plays for H-index
14 next year. For unplayed games, I have loads, the decision revolves
around how much time I want to spend learning new rules, and the length
of the games.</p>

<p>Along the way, I'd like to continue with LotR card game, which is always
good for an afternoon's amusement.</p>

<h3 id="h-index">H-index</h3>

<p>H-index is the number of games played number of times. For example, an
H-index of 5 means 5 games played 5 times. At the start of 2018, my
H-index is 12.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>101/68</code> <strong>Lord of the Rings LCG</strong> will almost surely be my top game
in 2018, as I have no plans to pursue Hive for now. The main reason
LotR stays at top billing is that each scenario can be played start to
stop in usually 3 hours max, and often much less time, and there is a
clear progression of scenarios to follow. Because I can play this solo,
it's easy to start and stop. Hive requires an opponent, and playing
turn-based may stretch over days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>63/63</code> <strong>Hive</strong> will probably lose its top billing in 2018. My best
bet for playing is online, and with the turns spread over several
days for a typical game, I get too wrapped up in the game at the
expense of other things. I look forward to the day I can spend some
serious time with Hive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>39/35</code> <strong>Ogre</strong> will likely stay in the Top 5, as I have no plans on
playing large amounts of PanzerBlitz in 2018, and it's unlikely that
any game other than Star Realms will rise close enough to challenge
Ogre's ranking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>30/27</code> <strong>Zombie Dice</strong> will almost surely pass PanzerBlitz, provided
I get any plays at all in 2018. It's such a favorite to bring out as
a warmup or cooldown game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>PanzerBlitz</strong> might see a play or two in 2018. Stranger
things have happened, and I haven't worked my way through all the
scenarios solo yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>23/19</code> <strong>Star Realms</strong> will almost surely climb right along with
Zombie Dice, these often get played in the same sessions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20/17</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong> stays in rotation. I have some unfinished
business with respect to computing probabilities for the very small
training games, which would be fun to work on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>18/11</code> <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> may or may not make it to the table
in 2018. I have no plans at the moment to set up solo games, and it's
not the easiest game to get a full crew for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>17/15</code> <strong>6 Nimmt!</strong> will climb, but not overly much this year. I
don't plan on bringing it out very often for 2 player sessions. It's a
must for 3 player sessions though.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Cathedral</strong> is overdue for a few more plays. It's not my
favorite game, but I do win it occasionally, and I find myself
strangely compelled to continue playing it when I can.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Race for the Galaxy</strong> will definitely climb, but probably
not into the top 5 in 2018.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/12</code> <strong>Ogre: Objective 218</strong> will stay in active rotation as a filler
game in 2018. I may also play a few solo games while doing chores on
weekends, it's a great game for that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/11</code> <strong>Vietnam Solitaire</strong> still has many plays left in it,
regardless of whether those plays land in 2018. <em>In 2019, play Special
Edition rules only.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Battle for Moscow</strong> will likely see at least a couple of
plays to keep it on the H-index. I haven't really figured this one
yet either. I have the mid-late game, which is the same as the mid-late
game for the others in this series (controlling the eastern edge
communication), but do not have a good handle on the early game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Objective Kiev</strong> may take a break this year. While I'm
pretty sure I'll get to H-index 13 this year, I'm not bent on having
Objective Kiev make that cut.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Pandemic</strong> will likely get a play or two, as it's a
favorite of main opponent who also likes coop games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Soviet Dawn</strong> I definitely want to play this more, not sure
how many plays will land in 2018.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/11</code> <strong>StarForce</strong> has a solo scenario, which I really ought to
play in 2018, at least once. I've been having trouble getting opponents
interested in playing this, sadly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Target Leningrad</strong> may or may not see action in 2018. It
will almost certainly stay on the H-index list, but it's easy enough to
play that a few games can be knocked out pretty fast. Since I have both
sides of this game figured out, it's essentially out of rotation unless
someone badly wants to play it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Flash Point</strong> I have not found a consistent opponent
with which to play Flash Point. I'm anticipating any games I get
in will be solo games, and that's fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Hapsburg Eclipse</strong> will almost surely see a play or two
in 2018, although it won't be a high priority.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/5</code> <strong>Leaving Earth</strong> joins the list as I am having quite a bit of
fun playing solo games with it. I may make up some LaTeX calculation
tables, the tables provided are not detailed enough for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>8/8</code> <strong>OCS</strong> will not see any plays Q1 2018, and most likely not in
Q2 either. Exceptions would be dropping in on other people's games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong> will probably not see any plays until Q3 or Q4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>1/1</code> <strong>COIN</strong> will almost surely not see any plays in Q1 or Q2 2018,
at least not solo, and not instigated by me. I might well be
interested in joining someone else's game.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wargame-specific-h-index">Wargame-specific H-index</h3>

<p>My wargame-specific H-index started 2017 at 10.  Wargames are so much
more time consuming that this index will increase much, much more slowly
than the overall H-index. And that's fine.</p>

  <li><code>27</code> PanzerBlitz</li>
  <li><code>18</code> Fire in the Lake</li>
  <li><code>20</code> Silver Bayonet</li>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
