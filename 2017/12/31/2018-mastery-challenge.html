2018 Mastery Challenge
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 31 2017</time>
<p>For the third year running, I'm creating a Mastery Challenge. While
I never seem to achieve the goals I set at the start of the year,
these challenges have served me well in the past by helping me
focus on getting better at the games I enjoy.</p>

<p>Here are the challenges from 2016 and 2017:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/2016/12/31/2017-mastery-challenge.html">2017 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2015/12/31/2016-challenge.html">2016 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to career commitments, I have no goals for 2018.</p>

<h3 id="h-index">H-index</h3>

<p>H-index is the number of games played number of times. For example, an
H-index of 5 means 5 games played 5 times. At the start of 2018, my
H-index is 12.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>68/68</code> <strong>Lord of the Rings LCG</strong> will almost surely be my top game
in 2018, as I have no plans to pursue Hive for now. The main reason
LotR stays at top billing is that each scenario can be played start to
stop in usually 3 hours max, and often much less time, and there is a
clear progression of scenarios to follow. Because I can play this solo,
it's easy to start and stop. Hive requires an opponent, and playing
turn-based may stretch over days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>63/63</code> <strong>Hive</strong> will probably lose its top billing in 2018. My best
bet for playing is online, and with the turns spread over several
days for a typical game, I get too wrapped up in the game at the
expense of other things. I look forward to the day I can spend some
serious time with Hive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>35/35</code> <strong>Ogre</strong> will likely stay in the Top 5, as I have no plans on
playing large amounts of PanzerBlitz in 2018, and it's unlikely that
any game other than Star Realms will rise close enough to challenge
Ogre's ranking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>PanzerBlitz</strong> might see a play or two in 2018. Stranger
things have happened, and I haven't worked my way through all the
scenarios solo yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>Zombie Dice</strong> will almost surely pass PanzerBlitz, provided
I get any plays at all in 2018. It's such a favorite to bring out as
a warmup or cooldown game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>18/18</code> <strong>Star Realms</strong> will almost surely climb right along with
Zombie Dice, these often get played in the same sessions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>17/17</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong> stays in rotation. I have some unfinished
business with respect to computing probabilities for the very small
training games, which would be fun to work on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>6 Nimmt!</strong> will climb, but not overly much this year. I
don't plan on bringing it out very often for 2 player sessions. It's a
must for 3 player sessions though.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Cathedral</strong> is overdue for a few more plays. It's not my
favorite game, but I do win it occasionally, and I find myself
strangely compelled to continue playing it when I can.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Race for the Galaxy</strong> will definitely climb, but probably
not into the top 5 in 2018.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Battle for Moscow</strong> will likely see at least a couple of
plays to keep it on the H-index. I haven't really figured this one
yet either. I have the mid-late game, which is the same as the mid-late
game for the others in this series (controlling the eastern edge
communication), but do not have a good handle on the early game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Objective 218</strong> will stay in active rotation as a filler
game in 2018. I may also play a few solo games while doing chores on
weekends, it's a great game for that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Objective Kiev</strong> may take a break this year. While I'm
pretty sure I'll get to H-index 13 this year, I'm not bent on having
Objective Kiev make that cut.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Soviet Dawn</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Target Leningrad</strong> may or may not see action in 2018. It
will almost certainly stay on the H-index list, but it's easy enough to
play that a few games can be knocked out pretty fast. Since I have both
sides of this game figured out, it's essentially out of rotation unless
someone badly wants to play it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Pandemic</strong> will likely get a play or two, as it's a
favorite of main opponent who also likes coop games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> may or may not make it to the table
in 2018. I have no plans at the moment to set up solo games, and it's
not the easiest game to get a full crew for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>StarForce</strong> has a solo scenario, which I really ought to
play in 2018, at least once. I've been having trouble getting opponents
interested in playing this, sadly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>Vietnam Solitaire</strong> still has many plays left in it,
regardless of whether those plays land in 2018.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Flash Point</strong> I have not found a consistent with which to
play Flash Point. I'm anticipating any games I get in will be solo
games, and that's fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Hapsburg Eclipse</strong> will almost surely see a play or two
in 2018, although it won't be a high priority.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>8/8</code> <strong>OCS</strong> will not see any plays Q1 2018, and most likely not in
Q2 either. Exceptions would be dropping in on other people's games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong> will probably not see any plays until Q3 or Q4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>1/1</code> <strong>COIN</strong> will almost surely not see any plays in Q1 or Q2 2018,
at least not solo, and not instigated by me. I might well be
interested in joining someone else's game.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wargame-specific-h-index">Wargame-specific H-index</h3>

<p>My wargame-specific H-index started 2017 at 10.  Wargames are so much
more time consuming that this index will increase much, much more slowly
than the overall H-index. And that's fine.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>35</code> Ogre</li>
  <li><code>27</code> PanzerBlitz</li>
  <li><code>17</code> Silver Bayonet</li>
  <li><code>12</code> Battle for Moscow</li>
  <li><code>12</code> Objective Kiev</li>
  <li><code>12</code> Soviet Dawn</li>
  <li><code>12</code> Target Leningrad</li>
  <li><code>11</code> Fire in the Lake</li>
  <li><code>11</code> StarForce</li>
  <li><code>10</code> Hapsburg Eclipse</li>
  <li><code>8</code> OCS</li>
  <li><code>7</code> France '40</li>
  <li><code>5</code> Phantom Leader</li>
  <li><code>1</code> COIN</li>
  <li><code>1</code> Combat Commander</li>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
