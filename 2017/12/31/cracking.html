Cracking a game
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 31 2017</time>

<p>What is mastery, anyway? Is it winning every game? Or is mastery
something more (or less) than that? Who decides? What are the
objective and subjective components of mastery?</p>

<p>Let's suppose any definition of mastery is subjective, and we're
free to define what it means for ourselves, with the understanding
that self-defined mastery may be regarded as naive delusion by
others.</p>

<p>In the context of a game, mastery could certainly be composed of
the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Rules</strong>: completely understanding the rules of a game. Someone
with a complete understanding of the rules will be positioned for
gaining a tactical advantage.</li>
  <li><strong>Tactical advantage</strong>: applying rules on a turn-by-turn basis
for advantage to gain strategic advantage.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic advantage</strong>: understanding the broad sweep of a game
for gaining overall advantage.</li>
  <li><strong>Cracking the game</strong>: having such a complete understanding of a game
to play optional strategy as any faction.</li>
</ul>

<p>This last item, game cracking, is my main interest.</p>

<h2 id="cracking-a-game">Cracking a game</h2>

<p>So far, I believe I've cracked only one game: Target Leningrad.
My belief in this has held up with opposed plays.</p>

<p>For other games, I believe I've cracked the German player for
Objective Kiev, but I haven't yet tested my belief it with
opposed plays. I have not yet cracked the Russian player in
Objective Kiev.</p>

<p>The other two games in the series are Battle for Moscow and The Arduous
Beginning, neither of which I can say I've cracked. I do have a pretty good
notion of how to play either side in both games, but have not yet been
able to achieve consistent results in solo plays.</p>

<p>What's next?</p>

<p>Hard to say.</p>

<p>I'm working through a progression series for Lord of the Rings card
game. There are dozens of scenarios. I'm up to scenario 9, Return to
Mirkwood. Some of the scenarios I feel comfortable saying I've cracked,
while others I can only say "the god of cards favored me that day."</p>

<p>While I'm at it, I should also mention I've played all twelve of the
PanzerBlitz original situations, and cracked at least a few of them.
(Situation #3 with with Arvold's modified OOB is actually is really
good game.) I plan to do more with PanzerBlitz in the future.</p>

<p>I have my eye on a couple of smaller games as well, Objective 218 and
The Agents. Both of these are fairly simple games, yet have subtle
twists in game play which did not emerge for me until playing a half
dozen times. While both are "difficult" to play solitaire, the
difficulty may reside in perspective. When I approach a game as an
exercise in mastery, there is no such difficulty as play revolves
around mastering the rules, mastering the immediate tactical advantage
for both sides, and building a bigger picture of the game play as a
thing in itself.</p>

<p>But mastering Objective 218 and The Agents is a step down, or at least
a lateral step in effort as compared to cracking Chadwick's Battle for
Moscow series. A step up in difficulty might be Winter War, and a step
up from that could be Silver Bayonet. PanzerGruppe Guderian might fit
right in between those.</p>

<h3 id="an-opinion">An opinion</h3>

<p>I have this notion, an opinion, that everyone should find something to
master. By everyone, I mean every single person on the planet. It would
be better if this mastery were something socially beneficial and
economically productive, and I believe entertainment, including
games, counts.</p>

<p>In the context of this community, I'm working to develop mastery across
a range of games. Some of them are light games, some heavier, some brand
new (published with last 2-3 years), some absolutely vintage.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see what vintage games people consider
themselves masters of, and read why they love the particular game so
much to be willing to play it any time, along with how many times
they have played it, what their win/loss rate is (approximately).</p>

<h3 id="for-2018">For 2018</h3>

<p>As I sit here pondering my upcoming work schedule for Q1 2018, I cannot
see that I will have a of time for any mastery effort in games at all.
One solution to this conundrum is to list right here, right now, a very
small selection of games for which I limit myself to playing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Arduous Beginning (11).</li>
  <li>Silver Bayonet.</li>
  <li>Winter War (11).</li>
  <li>Lord of the Rings.</li>
  <li>The Agents (8).</li>
  <li>Objective 218 (1).</li>
</ol>

<p>The number of additional plays to put the game on H-index is indicated
in parentheses. There is no implicit goal to achieve H-index with these
plays, but it's interesting to me to see where the mastery plays started
from. Also, all of these games already have more than one play, so it's
not getting me through my uplayed games at all, which is sort of a
bummer, but I just don't have time to learn new rules.</p>

<p>This is more than enough, and I'm putting some of these on here because
I need some flexibility for playing opponents, who will get bored
playing the same old games. The above should be enough variety to keep
opponents happy through Q1.</p>

<p>Everything else can be put away until Q2.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
