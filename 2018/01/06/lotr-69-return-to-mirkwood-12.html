LotR 69 - Return to Mirkwood (12)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan  6 2018</time>
<p>Trying the new deck for a second time:
<a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/85264">The Eagles Are Leaving!</a>.
This deck is similar to Beorn's deck, sans eagles, and not
limited to single core card counts.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quick Strike</li>
  <li>Northern Tracker</li>
  <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
</ol>

<p>Sure why not.</p>

<p>Initial Encounter: Great Forest Web.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw The Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, save resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Attercop Attercop. Game over.</li>
</ol>

<p>Reset with new shuffle of Encounter deck. We'll keep the same hand for
now.</p>

<hr />

<p>Initial encounter: Gollum's Anguish.</p>

<p>Hrmph. That puts this game in the toilet as well. We'll try it anyway.</p>

<h4 id="round-1-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw The Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, save resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Woodman's Glade. Threat 37, but
net +5 Progress on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: Woodman's Glade, exhaust Gimli.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Song of Travel.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Song of Travel on Thalin, play The Galadhrim's
Greetings, Threat 35.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Eowyn, draw Wood Elf Path. Woodman's Glade cleared,
add two more on quest for 7, discard Northern Tracker for 8.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Planning: Unexpected Courage on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Wolf Rider surge Great Forest Web.
discard Gondorian Spearman for net +2 on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: Great Forest Web, exhaust Gimli.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wolf Rider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Undefended, Shadow Wargs, +2 damage for 4 damage on Gollum.
Gimli refreshes and kills.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Dwarven Tomb.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Eowyn, draw The Brown Lands, Threat 44.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 48.</li>
</ol>

<p>Probably should have quested Gimli here.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Escort from Edoras.</li>
  <li>Planning: this is where I now need the Northern Tracker! Play
Gandalf. Threat 43.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Gimli, Escort from Edoras, draw Goblin Sniper.
Will is 11, 8 in staging, 2 for Great Forest Web, +1 net on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Brown Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Sniper.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, draw Despair, Gimli gets no defense.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 47.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Escort from Edoras.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Dwarven Tomb, play The Galadhrim's Greetings.
Threat 41.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw The Brown Lands! Threat 42.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Brown Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Sniper engaged.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, Shadow The Spider's Ring, no effect on
defended attack. Gimli attacks to kill Goblin Sniper.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 45.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Citadel Plate.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Citadel Plate on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Dry Watercourse.
Discard Stand and Fight and Fight for net +3 and
stage 1 is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: Dry Watercourse.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 49.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Escort from Edoras.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Mountains of Mirkwood.</li>
  <li>Travel: Wood Elf Path. Suck up some quest points to get allies
played.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's it because I'm going to threat out.</p>

<p>This could have been a pretty good game if I hadn't had the Gollum's
Anguish as the first draw. That really put me behind the power
curve on threat control. I'd have two more turns otherwise. Probably
still wouldn't win it given where I am on Round 8 with questing, but
still not bad otherwise.</p>

<p>What's ironic is that a couple of my earlier plays probably would have
been wins with this deck.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
