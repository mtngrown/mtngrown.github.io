LotR 71 - Return to Mirkwood (14)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan  7 2018</time>
<p>Continuing my exploration of
<a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/85264">The Eagles Are Leaving!</a>.</p>

<p>This game is pn Easy mode per the rules, with the exception of adding
the two normal mode Mirkwood Bats. One thing about not using Shadow
cards is that I'm now subject to the effects of every card in the deck.
However, there aren't that many enemies in this deck, so the cards don't
progress that fast anyway.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
  <li>The Galadhrim's Greetings</li>
  <li>Citadel Plate</li>
  <li>Song of Travel</li>
  <li>Escort from Edoras</li>
</ol>

<p>This was hand-picked, I pulled these cards from the deck and shuffled
the remainder to use for the draw. This might well be "cheating" in some
sense, but I don't really care. At this point, I'm more interested in
proving out the deck.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: Song of Travel on Thalin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Gimli, draw Great Forest Web.
Net +5 on Quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: Refresh Gimli, then exhaust for Great Forest Web.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Gimli, draw Wasted Provisions.
Net +7, clear Great Forest Web. Discard Vassal of the Windlord,
A Test of Will, Dwarven Axe, West Road Traveler, Hasty Stroke,
West Road Traveler, Hasty Stroke, Escort from Edoras, Ancient Mathom,
Feint.</li>
  <li>Travel: refresh Gimli for Woodman's Glade.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

  <li>Resource: 9, draw Northern Trackers.</li>
  <li>Planning: play The Galadhrim's Greetings, Threat 31.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, draw Mirkwood Bats. Net +5 clears
Woodman's Glade and Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: Citadel Plate on Gimli, play Escort from Edoras.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, draw The Spider's Ring. Threat 36.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Spider's Web.</li>
  <li>Encounter: The Spider's Web.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Planning: The Galadhrim's Greetings, Threat 34.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Gimli, draw Mountains of Mirkwood.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Vassal of the Windlord.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Gimli, Escort from Edoras (this is
where I'll win or lose the game), The Brown Lands. Could be
worse, like Hill Troll. Quest with 11, 7 Threat in Staging,
net 4 on quest. Will be tight.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Brown Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Citadel Plate.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Gimli, draw Gollumn's Bite. Not
a problem, put that on Gimli for 4 hits. Net +7 which
clears Stage 3.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 46.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw The Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: Galadhrim's Greetings, Vassal of the Windlord, Citadel Plate on Gimli.
Threat 40.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Thalin, Gimli, draw Wood Elf Path. Net +4 and that's a
win.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This turned out to be on the edge of too easy. I think it would be worth
playing again with a random draw on the player deck. That said, since
this was the 14th play of this quest, I had a pretty good idea of the
pitfalls, and it could have easily gone pear-shaped.</p>

<p>I do think it would be really, really hard without having at least Song
of Travel or Unexpected Courage in the initial hand, probably both.
While Citadel Plate turned out to be unnecessary in this game, there are
plenty of enemies for which it would be necessary.</p>

<p>I should do an in-depth analysis of this scenario in the future,
especially discussing the interplay of locations in the Staging area
and active versus the hinge between Stage 2 and 3. Given threat control,
that's where the game is most easily won and lost.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
