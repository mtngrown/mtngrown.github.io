LotR 73 - Into the Pit (3)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 24 2018</time>
<p>A second play of my <a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/edit/87270">first dedicated dwarf
deck</a>. The first play didn't go
nearly as well as I thought it should, so let's try it again and see
what happens.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Veteran Axehand</li>
  <li>Khazad! Khazad!</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Feint</li>
  <li>Dwarven Axe</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's roll with this and see what happens.</p>

<p>Watchful Eyes revealed and added to Dain.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, draw Signs of Conflict, Threat 31, surge Dark and
Dreadful 1 D to Thalin, 2 P on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Planning: Unexpected Courage on Dwalin, Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin and Dwalin, draw Cave In and remove 2 P from
East Gate. Net +4 Progress on East Gate.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw The Galadrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin and Dwalin, draw Goblin Swordsman, net +3
Progress on quest which clears it.</li>
  <li>Travel: First Hall, Threat 36.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dwalin readies and defends, draw Shadow Burning Low, enemy
gets +2 Attack, deals 3 D to Dwalin. Yikes. Veteran Axehand kills
Goblin Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw The Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin and Dwalin, draw Goblin Scout, only 1
Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Scout.</li>
  <li>Combat: Veteran Axehand defends, draw shadow Signs of Conflict
Threat 39, no damage on Veteran Axehand, Dwalin readies and kills
to reduce Threat to 37. About time.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Dwalin and 1 Veteran Axehand for 5, draw
Stair of Nain, no biggies, net +3 which clears the First Hall
and puts 2 P on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: Bridge of Khazad Dum, cannot play cardsâ€¦shouldn't
be a problem with what I have out.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Blade of Gondolin.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Dwalin, both Axehands, draw Branching Paths
for net +2 on quest. This is a bad card and may end up being the game
as if I can't clear this location on the next round.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 15, draw Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: all for 6, draw Fouled Well and that's the game
as I'm now in location lock.</li>
</ol>

<p>MAJOR BLUNDER: DID NOT PLAY THE CAVE TORCH! Actually, it might
not have helped in this game, but still, I completely overlooked it
which is dumb.</p>

<p>Not bad, but I think the deck needs a few more Allies.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
