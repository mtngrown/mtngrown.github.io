LotR 88 - Into the Pit (17)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 25 2018</time>
<p>Since I played Game 87 totally wrong right out of the
gate, let's try the updated <a href="http://ringsdb.com/deck/edit/87270">The Deeds
of Dwarves</a> again and see what
happens. This time, I'm going to play just the first round, then stop
and chill out a bit to think about how to get through the rest of the
scenario.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dwarven Tomb</li>
  <li>Dwarven Axe</li>
  <li>Feint</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Fili</li>
  <li>Gloin</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial encounter: Bzranching Paths.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Dwarrowdelf Axe. The Dwarrowdelf Axe
gets +1 Attack, but as important, it gets to put 1 Damage
on the enemy character immediately.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Dwalin and Thalin for 4W, draw Goblin Swordsman
for +1 P on East-Gate.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat: 30.</li>
</ol>

<p>Chill out phase: Note that Dain also gives +1 Attack to all dwarf
characters when he is ready.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Gloin.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, saving up to play Kili/Fili.</li>
  <li>Quest: Dwalin and Thalin for 4W, draw Lightless Passage,
bummer. Exhaust Cave Torch to put 3 P, draw Goblin Tunnels to
discard, Threat 34.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>Will have to use Cave Torch next round as well.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Kili.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Kili from Spirit, and search for Fili.
Also play Gloin and recoup 2 R to Leadership. Exhaust
Cave Torch to clear Lightless Passage, draw Branching Paths
for no effect.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Dwalin, Fili and Gloin for 9W, draw Patrol
Leader, +3 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Quick Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning: Dwarrowdelf Axe on Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Dwalin, Fili, Gloin for 9W, draw
Lightless Passage, Threat 37. Probably location locked
now, will need Gandalf to progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. Exhaust Cave Torch, draw Patrol Leader.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<p>Probably going to lose this one as well.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, Blade of Gondolin.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Blade of Gondolin on Dwalin. Exhaust
Cave Torch draw Cave in for no effect.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Dwalin, Kili, Fili, Gloin for 11W,
draw Branching Paths, net 0 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Quest: all, draw Many Roads, surge Dreadful Gap,
result is 18 T for Threat 45.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 46.</li>
</ol>

<p>I can't beat it now, unless I get several Gandalfs in a row.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Goblin Cleaver.</li>
  <li>Planning: none. Exhaust Cave Torch to get rid of one of the
Branching Paths, draw Signs of Conflict for no effect.</li>
  <li>Quest: all, draw Stairs of Nain for 18T against 12W
for Threat 52 and that's the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm putting this up for today. Getting through the East-Gate is just
a real problem.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
