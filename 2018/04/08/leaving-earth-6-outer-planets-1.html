Leaving Earth 6, Outer Planets 1
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr  8 2018</time>
<p>It's been nine months since I've had this game out of the box, just
had a hankering to do a solo play while I deal with some boring chores
and computer set up for work. This is also the first time I've set up
the Outer Planets expansion so it will be interesting.</p>

<p>Initial missions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Easy: Man in Orbit 4</li>
  <li>Easy: Lunar Survey 4</li>
  <li>Easy: Artificial Satellite 2</li>
  <li>Medium: Working Probe/Capsule on Mars 7</li>
  <li>Non-Explorable: Grand Tour 10</li>
  <li>Non-Explorable: Uranus Survey 9</li>
  <li>Non-Explorable: Titan Survey 6</li>
  <li>Non-Explorable: Neptune Survey 10</li>
</ol>

<p>As I set this up, I don't really get how the missions for Outer
Planets work, but I figure I'll understand it once I play through.
Not intending on finishing today I don't think. Mostly want to really
dig into the rules and mission planning.</p>

<h3 id="section"><code>1956</code></h3>

<p>Going for the Artificial Satellite mission first, just to get
into the swing of the game again. The difficulty is 8, which is a lot.
From the reference card, the Soyuz can do this in a single shot. That's
an expensive proposition though. Let's buy some stuff:</p>

<table class="center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Component</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Soyuz Adv.</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Soyuz rocket</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Probe</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>John Glenn</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>That was an easy year!</p>

<p>Maybe I'll take out the garbage next, then proceed to 1957.</p>

<h3 id="section-1"><code>1957</code></h3>

<p>I can't do a lot with $25 on one turn, but I can definitely fire
the Soyuz and take an Outcome off of it: <strong>Success</strong>.</p>

<p>Score: 2.</p>

<p>Should I spend $10 to remove the Success, or use that $10 to advance
technology? That would depend on the next mission, which will be Man in
Orbit. For this I'll need a capsule and a Reentry Advancement. It will
require 2 Soyuz rockets to boost the capsule into orbit.</p>

<p>Reading the rules for Reentry finds that these are going to need to be
tested with capsules, which is 2 Soyuz each because they have to come in
from Earth Orbit (instead of say, Suborbital). <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/article/24710271#24710271">Reentry from the Leaving
Earth designer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You only draw from Re-entry when a capsule with a heat shield performs
a maneuver with the atmospheric entry hazard (shown with a cloud
symbol).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Canonical answer, awesome.</p>

<p>So basically it's risk assessemnt now.</p>

<p>At a minimum, Reentry for $10, 2 Soyuz at $16, 1 Vostok at $2, and one
astronaut costing $5 gets me the mission.  I already have the astronaut.
Since the remaining totals $28, I can't do it this turn in any case.
I'm going to buy off the Success:</p>

<table class="center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Component</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Reentry Adv.</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Success Outcome</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vostok</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Probe</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Supplies</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Not much of a turn, really.</p>

<h3 id="section-2"><code>1958</code></h3>

<p>While I'm at it, it would be smart to set up for the Lunar Survey
mission, which can be completed by putting a Probe into Lunar Fly By.
The difficulty from Earth Orbit to Lunar Fly By is 1, which means a Juno
can handle it. I'll need to purchase a Survey Advancement.</p>

<p>This turn: 3x Soyuz and 1 Supply.</p>

<h3 id="section-3"><code>1959</code></h3>

<p>Test fire another Soyuz: <strong>Success</strong>. Buy it off for $10.</p>

<p>Purchase a Juno Advancement for $10, 3x Juno and 1 Probe.</p>

<p>Another short turn.</p>

<h3 id="section-4"><code>1960</code></h3>

<p>Purchase Surveying Advancement for $10.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to do something a bit different, by test
firing a bunch of cheap Juno rockets to see if I turn up a Failure
which I can buy off. I won't buy off any successes.</p>

<p>Since I own 3 Junos already, test, all are success.</p>

<p>Purchase 2 more, test, both successes.</p>

<p>Now test the remaining Soyuz: <strong>Success</strong>. I have $13 left,
let's do the Lunar Fly By:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Purchase another Juno and another Soyuz.</li>
  <li>Launch to Earth Orbit, automatic success.</li>
  <li>Manuever to Lunar Fly By, fire Juno: Success.</li>
  <li>Survey: <strong>Major Failure</strong> and I only have $4 left. Bummer.
I need to check the rules to see whether the last card is
removed if it's a failure, or whether I'll have to run another mission
(fail another mission) to get it removed.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I'll purchase a Vostok and 2 Junos with the $4 remaining.</p>

<h3 id="section-5"><code>1961</code></h3>

<p>First, survey Suborbital from Earth Orbit, I have a Probe there.
That fails, I lose the Probe, but now I have Survey Advancement.</p>

<p>Now purchase 2x Soyuz for $16 and refly the Lunar Fly By. Hopefully
there won't be a lurking failure on the Juno, but I have $$$ if there
is. Lunar Survey indicates Vast Clouds of Dust, which would destroy a
lander. Good thing I'm not going to land.</p>

<p>Score: 6.</p>

<p>I have $4 remaining, purchase 2 Vostoks.</p>

<h3 id="section-6"><code>1962</code></h3>

<p>It's getting late-ish in the day, 4:45, and I'm running out of steam.
Still need to get more software running on work laptop, it's all about
ssh keys next. Boring. What will 1962 bring us?</p>

<p>Definitely purchasing Ion Thruster Advancement for $10.</p>

<p>Also picked up an Ion Thruster and a Galileo Probe.</p>

<p>Short turn this 1962.</p>

<h3 id="section-7"><code>1963</code></h3>

<p>Two things I don't really understand about Ion Thrusters yet:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Exactly how testing is performed, and</li>
  <li>how payloads are handled.</li>
</ol>

<p>For Ion Thruster testing, apparently it is conducted "per
manuever." So a manuever to Mars Orbit would require 1 test,
then a manuever back to Earth Orbit would require another test.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/article/25940765#25940765">great explanation for handling Ion Thruster
payloads</a>.</p>

<p>Purchase 1 Soyuz to test Ion Thruster on a moon run. It has a Minor
Failure. I think this means that it stays in Earth Orbit and I can
repair it next year.</p>

<p>Buying another Soyuz, $4 left over, will buy Junos.</p>

<h3 id="section-8"><code>1964</code></h3>

<p>Purchase Ion Thruster, boost with Soyuz, test: Success and
pay that one off.</p>

<p>Have $5 remaining, purchase Jim Lovell for Life Support and Repair.</p>

<h3 id="section-9"><code>1965</code></h3>

<p>Fire Ion Thruster to test back to Earth Orbit: <strong>Minor Failure</strong>
and pay $5 to remove the Outcome. This Ion Thruster is stuck in Lunar
Orbit however. Bummer.</p>

<p>I'm now wishing I had just gone straight to Saturn, as Soyuz leaves me
with odd numbers of cash at the end of the turn.</p>

<p>Bought a couple of Probes to finish the cash.</p>

<h3 id="section-10"><code>1966</code></h3>

<p>Test Reentry, <strong>Success</strong>.</p>

<p>This is dumb, I could have been testing Landing from
Suborbital using Junos.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Success.</li>
  <li>Success.</li>
  <li>Success.</li>
  <li>Minor Failure, pay it off.</li>
  <li>Success and Landings are good.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now I can land my Ion Thruster for a free repair on Earth.
This is definitely a trick to the game.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28763460#28763460">another look at bringing down spacecraft from
orbit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section-11"><code>1967</code></h3>

<p>Purchase 2 Soyuz and an Eagle Capsule, launch for Mars Orbit
with Ion Thruster.</p>

<p>Purchase another Soyuz and a Juno.</p>

<h3 id="section-12"><code>1968</code></h3>

<p>Remove 1 time token from Mars Orbit.</p>

<p>Purchase Soyuz and get Galileo Probe into Earth Orbit,
need to get this kicked off for Grand Tour. Purchase Eagle
Capsule and Ion Thruster.</p>

<h3 id="section-13"><code>1969</code></h3>

<p>Remove 2d Time Token from Mars Orbit.</p>

<p>Purchase Soyuz and Rendezvous for $18. Launch Soyuz with Ion
Thruster and rendezvous with Galileo Capsule in Earth Orbit.
Rendezvous is success, so the spacecraft is ready to travel
now.</p>

<p>Purchase another Galileo for $5, 2 more Junos.</p>

<h3 id="section-14"><code>1970</code></h3>

<p>Remove 3rd Time Token from Mars Orbit.</p>

<p>Land Eagle Capsule separation from Ion Thruster in
Mars Orbit, Success, lands on Mars, finds Sample Return is worth $50.</p>

<p>Score: 13.</p>

<p>Purchase Soyuz, build with Eagle Capsule, Man to Earth Orbit and Back.</p>

<p>Score: 17.</p>

<p>At this point, getting the Grand Tour Launched probably wins it for me.
I better read up on what it takes to complete the Grand Tour.</p>

<p>Put the Ion Thruster in Mars Orbit back into motion, manuever to Earth
Orbit.</p>

<p>Purchase 2 Soyuz and 1 Explorer.</p>

<h3 id="section-15"><code>1971</code></h3>

<p>Remove Time Token from Earth Orbit spacecraft.</p>

<p>Two things I want to do this turn:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Plan a Mars Sample Return.</li>
  <li>Plan a Titan Exploration.</li>
</ol>

<p>To get the samples back, I'm going to need to purchase an Atlas
Advancement and get those Atlas rockets tested.</p>

<p>Purchase Atlas Advancement for $10, Atlas for $5, test: <strong>Success</strong> and
pay that one off.</p>

<h4 id="titan-exploration">Titan Exploration</h4>

<p>I have to punt on this, I want to finish out the game, but just
don't have the cycles to add this in as well.</p>

<h3 id="section-16"><code>1972</code></h3>

<p>Remove 2nd Time Token from Ion Thruster returning from Mars Orbit.</p>

<p>Purchase Atlas, test: <strong>Major Failure</strong>, pay this off.</p>

<p>Purchase Atlas, test: <strong>Minor Failure</strong>, pay this off.</p>

<p>Launch Grand Tour Ion Thruster with Galileo into Venus Fly By.</p>

<p>Wait, this won't work, there is no manuever from Earth Orbit to Venus
Fly By, it has to manuever to Inner Planets Transfer the first year,
then VFB the second year. This is a bummer, as I should otherwise
have the tech to make this happen. Perhaps all is not lost…what if
I launched a Soyuz carrying a Soyuz, an Atlas, and a Juno. It's doable.</p>

<p>Will need to purchase an Atlas. Fingers crossed on Rendezvous…
<strong>Success</strong> (I'd have put up the game if this was a major failure).
Now fire the Atlas to get to IPT next year. This just works:
Galileo, 2 Junos and Ion Thruster are mass 5, Atlas is mass 4, difficulty
is 3, total is 27 which is exactly what thrust is provided by the Atlas.
We'll be in IPT next year.</p>

<h3 id="section-17"><code>1973</code></h3>

<p>Remove Time Token from returning Mars Ion Thruster.</p>

<p>Remove Time Token from IPT craft and Manuever to VFB. We have
payload mass 2, rocket masses 1, difficulty 2, Thrust is 8
from Junos + 5 from Ion for 13 thrust, need 6. So only needed
1 Juno. Fire the Junos, first: <strong>Success</strong>, second <strong>Success</strong>.</p>

<p>Atlas is repaired.</p>

<p>Purchase 3 Soyuz and 1 Juno.</p>

<h3 id="section-18"><code>1974</code></h3>

<p>Remove Time Token from VFB, manuever to Jupiter Fly By.</p>

<p>I think I've messed up again: I need to get into orbit to be able to
survey and reveal a location.  I don't think it can be done from a Fly
By. This means no way to get a Grand Tour this late in the game. Bummer.
I'll go on to attempt to reveal the Titan Location.</p>

<p>Purchase 3 Soyuz and 1 Juno.</p>

<h3 id="section-19"><code>1975</code></h3>

<p>Remove Time Token from Galileo in Jupiter Fly By. Purchase Aerobrake.
Sadly, I do not believe I can Aerobrake into Jupiter Orbit with Ion
Thruster, there is no parenthentized hourglass on that manuever. I'll
have to continue on to Saturn.</p>

<p>Purchase another Ion Thruster and an Eagle Capsule, blast off for
Orbit. I'm going to clear Rendezvous next turn.</p>

<p>Manuever to Saturn Fly By.</p>

<h3 id="section-20"><code>1976</code></h3>

<p>Remove Time Token from Saturn Fly By.</p>

<p>Fully test Rendezvous: <strong>Success, Success</strong> and <strong>Success</strong>.</p>

<p>Rendezvous the Ion Thrusters and head to Mars Orbit.</p>

<p>Bah. Cannot even attempt to get into orbit with a single Ion
Thruster, will need 2 at a minimum.</p>

<p>Calling the game here. The Mars Sample Return is in the bag,
no need to worry about it.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Mostly, some questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I made an assumption that Sample Return requires a lander. The rules
  say it can be done with a Probe (page 31). On page 12, "Samples can be
  collected from the surface of any solid body — that is, a planet,
  a moon, or an asteroid." This implies using a Probe for Reentry to get
  to the surface, except that having a rocket to return to orbit implies
  Landing.</p>

    <p>The question here: Does the probe or capsule need to be returned
 to Earth along with the sample? I would say it does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rules consistently state that surveying can be done from Orbit,
but I do not see anywhere that surveying can be done from Fly By
locations. This is well and good for everything but Uranus and
Neptune, which do not have Orbit locations, implying that having a
Probe in Fly By is sufficient to Reveal Location.</p>

    <p>The main question: can a single Probe can make the Grand
Tour by revealing locations at each Fly By location they occupy?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Probably more questions, but I'm running out of steam and have a very
full week ahead of me.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
<p>
Updated August 30, 2015.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>
