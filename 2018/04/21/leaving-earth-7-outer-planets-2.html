Leaving Earth 7, Outer Planets 2
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 21 2018</time>
<p>It's been a whole week since I've played Leaving Earth. Much better than
the nine month stretch previously. The last game ended a bit early, did
not make it all the way to 1986. I do not expect this one to go the full
distance either. I have to do a few more chores today, and need to do a
bit of work stuff, and I'm pretty well exhausted from the work week and
insomnia.</p>

<p>I'm going to do a Normal level game with the Outer Planets expansion added
in:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Easy: Working Probe/Capsule in Earth Orbit.</li>
  <li>Easy: Man to Space and Back.</li>
  <li>Easy: Man to Earth Orbit and Back.</li>
  <li>Easy: Reveal Moon Location.</li>
  <li>Medium: Working Probe/Capsule on Ceres.</li>
  <li>OP: Reveal Europa Location.</li>
  <li>OP: Reveal Ganymede Location.</li>
  <li>OP: Reveal Titan Location.</li>
  <li>OP: Reveal Io Location.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="section"><code>1956</code></h3>

<p>I'm going to start this game with Saturn's because it's solo, there is
no really early pressure, and I want to be able to get a crap ton of
stuff into orbit early on. So, the Saturn Advancement and 1 Saturn
Rocket.</p>

<h3 id="section-1"><code>1957</code></h3>

<p>Another Saturn and Ion Thrusters Advancement.</p>

<h3 id="section-2"><code>1958</code></h3>

<p>Buy another Saturn and an Ion Thruster.</p>

<h3 id="section-3"><code>1959</code></h3>

<p>Probe x 2, Galileo x 2, Supplies x 1.</p>

<p>Boost the 2 Probes and the Supplies into Earth Orbit with Saturn.
Outcome is <strong>Success</strong>.</p>

<p>Score: 2, for Working Probe in Earth Orbit.</p>

<p>Note that Suborbital Flight can only be explored by sending a manned
Mission there (page 30 of Leaving Earth rule book).</p>

<h3 id="section-4"><code>1960</code></h3>

<p>Purchase Surveying Advancement.</p>

<p>Boost a Galileo with Saturn, test <strong>Success</strong>.</p>

<p>Purchase Eagle and 1 x Supplies.</p>

<h3 id="section-5"><code>1961</code></h3>

<p>Assemble Saturn with Ion Thruster, Supplies and Eagle.
Test: Success.</p>

<p>[<em>Note: Eagle requires Landing Advancement before purchase. Also,
once the Eagle Capsule is in space, if the Life Support Advancement
has been purchased, it induces a Outcome draw at the end of every
year. This is actually very cool, as it does not need to be manned
to draw outcomes, and a Failure on Life Support does not destroy
the capsule.</em>]</p>

<p>Purchase Saturn and Rendezvous Advancement.</p>

<h3 id="section-6"><code>1962</code></h3>

<p>Purchase Ion Thruster, boost thruster to Earth Orbit
with Galileo.</p>

<p>Purchase Juno Advancement, Juno x 5.</p>

<p>Next turn will be full Rendezvous testing.</p>

<h3 id="section-7"><code>1963</code></h3>

<p>Full Rendezvous testing between Probes and Ion Thruster
spacecraft. First is success, 2d is Success, third
is Success.</p>

<p>This leaves me with $5 left over. Fire some Junos:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Success.</li>
  <li>Minor Failure, pay this off.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm in the game in a big way at this point. Next move is to fire the
Ions off to do some surveys. Will need to think about this.</p>

<h3 id="section-8"><code>1964</code></h3>

<p>Let's go to Saturn. We need to get to Venus in 1968, with a Galileo,
which should not be too difficult with a single Ion Thruster.</p>

<p>The difficulty is 5, it takes 2 years normally, with payload 2. Ion
Thruster has mass 1. So, 5 * (2 + 1) = 15 &gt; 2 years * 5 thrust, so
we'll set it up for 3 years and launch it next year. Then we'll see
what happens.</p>

<p>However, I can test fire the Ion Thrusters. After some perusal of the
rules, it's ok to declare a manuever of one year, then abort the the
manuever. This makes sense physically, sort of. Nobody is going to shoot
off an expensive rocket to, say, Mars just for a test.</p>

<p>Let's test fire the first Ion Thruster: This was success.</p>

<p>Second Ion Thruster: success, and bought that off.</p>

<p>Astronaut for remaining $5, Jim Lovell.</p>

<h3 id="section-9"><code>1965</code></h3>

<p>Fire Ion Thruster for taking off to Venus: but this is a mistake,
I can't make the trip to Venus from Earth Orbit in one manuever, it
needs to be 2 manuevers: 1 to Inner Planet Transfer, the second to
Venus Flyby. I'm going to pretend that I did the two year trip to IPT
and that this turn removes a time token. This will put the game back in
harmony, with the risk of losing the Ion Thruster on the IPT to Venus
Fly By. Except I can do another test in Earth Orbit to clear the last
Outcome: Success. Ion Thrusters are now ready for business.</p>

<p>Purchase Saturn and Atlas Advancement.</p>

<h3 id="section-10"><code>1966</code></h3>

<p>Time token comes off. Manuever into Venus Fly By, add two time tokens.</p>

<p>Solar Radiation hazard, 2 time token roll. No effect for Galileo.</p>

<p>Purchase another Saturn and two Atlas.</p>

<h3 id="section-11"><code>1967</code></h3>

<p>Time token from Venus Fly By.</p>

<p>Purchase a load of stuff: Eagle, Explorer x 2, Ion, Atlas x 2.</p>

<p>Two Saturns boost 4 Atlas, 2 Explorer, 1 Ion and 1 Juno into Orbit.
That's a load of stuff. I need to test landing at some point, will need
it for man to Earth and back and for Ceres.</p>

<p>This uses up all my money for this year, so I'm reading ahead on
Landing. It looks like the
<a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/25468455#25468455">cheapest way to test landing is with 4
Junos launched into Suborbital flight</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section-12"><code>1968</code></h3>

<p>Time token from Venus Fly By. Manuever into Jupiter Fly By and add
two time tokens.</p>

<p>Purchase Landing Advancement. Fire Junos to Suborbital, test
three times, all Success, test Landing, Success and buy that one
off.</p>

<p>Buy 4 Junos.</p>

<h3 id="section-13"><code>1969</code></h3>

<p>Time token from Jupiter Fly By.</p>

<p>Assemble Juno and Probe in Earth Orbit. Will run a survey
test here: <strong>Major Failure</strong>, buy this off for $5.</p>

<p>Another Landing test with Junos, launchâ€¦Success. Landing
test is Success. Purchase 4 more Junos and do this again:
Junos are successful, and last Landing is Successful.</p>

<p>Purchase Atlas and Juno.</p>

<h3 id="section-14"><code>1970</code></h3>

<p>Remove time token from Jupiter Fly By, now able to survey
something.</p>

<p>Test Atlas on Earth: Success.</p>

<p>Purchase Atlas and Ion.</p>

<p>Survey Io: nothing to see there.</p>

<p>Score: 6.</p>

<p>Automatic manuever to Saturn Fly By, reveals Jupiter
with beta letter and one die per astronaut roll of 1
is incapacitated, two time tokens on Saturn Fly By.</p>

<p>The Jupiter Mission is Man On/Orbiting Jupiter or one of
its moons at start of year for 25 points.</p>

<h3 id="section-15"><code>1971</code></h3>

<p>One time token from Saturn Fly By.</p>

<p>Test Atlas: Success. One more of these to test.</p>

<p>Fire the Ceres Mission off from Earth Orbit, which is a
maneuver to IPT.</p>

<p>Purchase Saturn rocket.</p>

<h3 id="section-16"><code>1972</code></h3>

<p>Take time token from Saturn Fly By.</p>

<p>Survey Titan, reveal alpha Separate and Discard Explorer Payload
on Titan, 22 points.</p>

<p>Score 12.</p>

<p>Reveal Saturn location which is a beta, draw Man to Saturn Fly By
and Back for 35 points! Dang! No way I'm going to win this one. I need
to play the base game a bit more. Put 5 time tokens on
spacecraft and move to Uranus Fly By.</p>

<p>Send a probe to Lunar Fly By for last Atlas test. This is
inefficient, but I have the Atlas in Earth Orbit already, and if it
works it will save me a little time and money. <strong>Major Failure!!!</strong>
It had to happen at some point. Buy it off with $5.</p>

<p>Purchase Life Support Advancement, Aldrin, Atlas and Juno.</p>

<h3 id="section-17"><code>1973</code></h3>

<p>Time token off of Uranus Fly By.</p>

<p>Ceres landing, now that the Atlas has been tested, the landing
is a success.</p>

<p>Score: 20.</p>

<p>I may put it up here for the week. I've been trying to plan a mission to
Jupiter Orbit and it's a bitch. It's the supplies which are the killer.</p>

<p>Aerobraking though I think I've got figured out: send 3 Junos to Mars
Fly by with an Ion Thruster and test it there. Make sure to have enough
cash on hand to clear the failures, it could take all $25. Timing on
this is important as Life Support needs to be tested as well.</p>

<p>I don't really know what to do here, I need more technology like Soyuz
or Proton. I'm running out of years.</p>

<p>Purchase Proton Advancement for $10, and one Proton.</p>

<p>Need another Saturn to make a big lift.</p>

<p>Mean time, Man to Space and Back, manuever to Suborbital and
reveal, landing with the Eagle capsule. Suborbital is 1 die
per astronaut, 1 is incapacitated. Roll 4, Jim Lovell is back on Earth.</p>

<p>Score: 22.</p>

<h3 id="section-18"><code>1974</code></h3>

<p>Time token from Uranus Fly By.</p>

<p>Purchase Saturn, 3 Junos, Probe, make a big lift.</p>

<p>Payload: 4 Juno, Aldrin, Probe, Ion, Proton, Atlas.</p>

<p>Ion Thruster and 4 Juno to Mars Fly By to test Aerobraking.</p>

<p>Juno and Probe to Lunar Fly By, Survey and reveal nothing
on the moon.</p>

<p>Score: 26.</p>

<p>Drawing random outcome on Life Support: Minor Failure, it's going to
have to do I don't know whatâ€¦need to hit the forums for this one.</p>

<p>Testing Life Support apparently works like this: at the end of the year,
an outcome is drawn, which means only one test per year per capsule
may be conducted. Note that <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/25430549#25430549">Life Support failures do not imply
damage</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that only the Aldrin Capsule <em>requires</em> Life
Support. The other capsule may <em>use</em> Life Support if used to carry
astronauts more than one year. However, once the Life Support
Advancement is purchased, these capsules will be subject to drawing
outcomes.</p>

<p>This is enough for today. I'll pick this back up in a couple of weeks,
after I get back from a company retreat next weekend. (Not happy I have
to go on this, it was too hard to refuse, I tried.)</p>

<h3 id="section-19"><code>1975</code></h3>

<p>I successfully escaped the company retreat! This will cost me I'm sure
at work later, but I judged the downside risk of attending to be too
great. I just don't have the emotional energy for these sorts of things
at the moment.</p>

<p>Time tokens, remove from Jupiter and Uranus bound.</p>

<p>Apparently I have 3 Juno going to Mars to test Aerobraking. They will be
there in 1977.</p>

<p>Put the Titan mission in thrust to Inner Planet Transfer, need to be at
Venus in 1980. Put 4 time tokens on it to arrive at IPT in 1979, then 1
year to Venus, 1 year to Jupiter, and 2 years to Saturn. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Purchase Re-entry. Test Life Support, minor failure and buy that off.
Purchase Aerobrake.</p>

<h3 id="section-20"><code>1976</code></h3>

<p>Remove time tokens from Titan, Mars and Uranus missions.</p>

<p>Test Proton, success. Purchase Eagle Capsule and supplies.</p>

<p>End of turns.</p>

<p>Test Life Support: Success.</p>

<h3 id="section-21"><code>1977</code></h3>

<p>Remove time tokens from Mars, Uranus and IPT craft.
The Uranus mission takes first turn, reveals nothing
on Uranus, lost after this because no manuever to Neptune.</p>

<p>Three Junos in Mars Fly By, let's fire them for Aerobraking:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Success.</li>
  <li>Success.</li>
  <li>Success.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ion thruster aerobrakes into Mars Orbit for return to Earth
Orbit.</p>

<p>End of turn.</p>

<p>Test life support: Success. Lose $5. Bummer.</p>

<h3 id="section-22"><code>1978</code></h3>

<p>Remove time token from Ion in Mars Orbit, add
3 to get to Earth Orbit. Remove token from IPT.</p>

<p>The Jupiter mission is scrubbed, forgot to purchase
two more Ion Thrusters and enough lift to get them into orbit.
I can get to Outer Planets Transfer in 2 years, so I'll do a lift in
1980 and hopefully have enough mojo to get there. I need to buy a lot of
rocketry between now and then.</p>

<p>Purchase Saturn and Ion.</p>

<p>End of turn: Life Support Outcome: Major Failure. Ok, that's good,
I only have 2 outcomes here, so this won't be too hard to purchase
away. It effectively reduces my spend to $20 though, at a time when
I need to buy stuff.</p>

<h3 id="section-23"><code>1979</code></h3>

<p>Remove time token from Ion to Earth Orbit. Remove time token from
IPT, add time token to get to Venus Fly By.</p>

<p>Purchase Saturn and Ion.</p>

<p>End of turn: Life Support Major Failure.</p>

<h3 id="section-24"><code>1980</code></h3>

<p>At Venus Fly By, time token to Jupiter Fly By.</p>

<p>Purchase Saturn and boost one to Earth Orbit.</p>

<p>Cannot do the Jupiter mission this year. If I can boost in
1982, I can do the mission. If not, it's scrubbed.</p>

<p>End of turn, Life Support Outcome: Success and buy that off.</p>

<h3 id="section-25"><code>1981</code></h3>

<p>Time token from Earth Orbit. Time token from Jupiter Fly By,
add two time tokens and manuever to Saturn Fly By.</p>

<p>Purchase Saturn and supplies, launch to Earth Orbit.</p>

<p>Here's the stack blasting for Outer Planets Transfer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Saturn: 20</li>
  <li>Proton: 6</li>
  <li>Ion x 2: 2</li>
  <li>Atlas x 2: 8</li>
  <li>Aldrin: 3</li>
  <li>Supplies: 3</li>
  <li>Total: 42</li>
</ul>

<p>Difficulty 6.</p>

<p>Thrust required: 252</p>

<p>Thrust available 200 + 10 + 70 = 280.</p>

<p>Fire the Saturn (success), Ions (success) and the Proton: <strong>Success</strong>.
Lucky.</p>

<p>End of turn.</p>

<p>Life support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eagle: Major Failure, purchase.</li>
  <li>Aldrin: success.</li>
</ul>

<p>Spend 1 supply.</p>

<p>This was a bit sketchy, Protons are not fully tested. But it worked.</p>

<p>End-of-year: success, no astronaut perishes.</p>

<h3 id="section-26"><code>1982</code></h3>

<p>I need to get turn order figured out. From the back of the Outer Planets
manual:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete start-of-year missions such as Space Station. None.</li>
  <li>Everyone's money resets to $25.</li>
  <li>Players take turns.</li>
  <li>Damaged components on Earth repaired for free.</li>
  <li>Check Astronaut health in space.</li>
  <li>Remove time token from each craft with token.</li>
  <li>End-of-year hazards occur.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="turns">Turns</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Burn Atlas and Ion x 2 to get from Outer Planets
Transfer to Jupiter Fly By:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Total mass: 15</li>

      <li>Thrust: 27 + 20 = 47.</li>
      <li>Required: 60.</li>

    <p>Looks like I miscalculated that one, this mission is over.
Missing the launch window for the Venus Fly By sucked. Will
need to try this mission again some time.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Man to Earth Orbit and back: Purchase a Saturn, an Eagle

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Score: 30.</p>

<p>Remove time token from Saturn Fly By.</p>

<p>The game is technically over, as I will not be able to score enough
points on the Titan mission to win. Let's play that out anyway.</p>

<h3 id="section-27"><code>1982</code></h3>

<p>No start of year missions, collect $25.</p>

<h4 id="turns-1">Turns</h4>

<p>Single turn to complete all the manuever into Titan Orbit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Saturn Orbit: Can't do it with Ion Thrusters, there is no time token.
I would have needed to tote an Atlas out with me. Not sure if I could
have done that. Surprised I messed this one up.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Final score: 30 - 4 = 26, with 89 left on the table. Not real great!</p>

<p>Learned a bunch of good stuff this game, especially about testing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Life support: Get the Advancement early, then any capsule which can
carry passengers is going to automatically test for Life Support at the
end of every year, even if the capsule isn't manned. This means is a
really cheap way to get a look at the outcome cards, choosing to buy off
only the failures are they occur. With even two capsule in, say, Earth
Orbit, a few years before they're necessary, end of year outcomes will
provide a pretty good look at the outcome draws.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Landing: test with 4 Junos, 3 to boost to Suborbital, the fourth to
test the landing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Junos can be tested by just cycling through the deck looking for
failures. They are so cheap it hardly matters, and buying off successes
on Junos is relatively expensive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proton Advancement requires Soyuz Advancement, so I made a mistake
when I purchased the Proton. As it turns out, it won't have really
hurt the game any, everything I did could have been done with Soyuz,
just in a slightly different order.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the rules, Life Support is tested after all turns are complete.
This means one cannot purchase, and to buy off outcomes for Life
Support, that money must be saved, and potentially lost. That sucks.
This makes the solo game a lot harder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I've been removing time tokens at the beginning of the turns
instead of at the end of the turns. I need to play a careful hard game
of the Base rules.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="turn-order-template">Turn order template</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Complete start-of-year missions such as Space Station.</li>
  <li>Everyone's money resets to $25.</li>
  <li>Players take turns.</li>
  <li>Damaged components on Earth repaired for free.</li>
  <li>Check Astronaut health in space.</li>

<p>Here's a large image of the setup:</p>

<p>It's a pretty cool map. Would be excellent to have a potential KPO
expansion, but we'll see how that happens.</p>

What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
