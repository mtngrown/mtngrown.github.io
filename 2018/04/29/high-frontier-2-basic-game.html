<p>I've got High Frontier laid out on the main table. I've decided I want
to get a solid grip on the Basic Game rules, and having set up for a
while will be helpful. For various reasons such as apartment cleaning,
parental visit, plumbing work, and various other "life issue" the table
will be coming down after this game.</p>

<p>The main focus of this game will be understanding income and movement,
two basic mechanics without which there is just no game play at all.
Since I have not yet seen any decent writeups on how this is done, I
plan on taking extensive notes. The mission is to replay the H9
example in the rules, Mission to Luna and Back. I tried this once
before and some how managed to fail, probably by attempting
to acquire my own tech. Let's see what happens this time using the
technology described in the example of play.</p>

<h3 id="years--7-to-0"><code>Years -7 to 0</code></h3>

<p>I can collect 5 WT every two years using operations, which is
super boring. Since this is a solo game, I'm dealing myself 20
WT and calling it good.</p>

<p>See H1, H2, H3 Operations in the Colonization Rules.</p>

<h3 id="year-1"><code>Year 1</code></h3>

<p>Operation: Boost H4.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Year 1: Launch of Lunar Mission. After years of
research, the PRC pays 4 WT to boost his crew, a mirror
steamer (output 3•4), and a cat fusion robonaut (ISRU
= 2, mass = 3, assuming basic game masses). He
puts a rocket figure in LEO, and a blue dry mass disk
with a fuel figure on the number “4” spot. He spends
6 WT to add 6 tanks of fuel, moving the fuel figure to
“10”. It is now “Transport Class”, with a net thrust of 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier/h9-example-year-1.jpg" alt="Setting out" /></p>

<p>The rocket stack is arranged on the Playmat for photographic
convenience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Year 1 (continued): Cis-Lunar Move. The Rocket Stack
burns 4 steps of fuel to enter Earth HEO and coast to the
Van Allen Belt (VAB radiation space). It is now wet mass 8.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The VAB space is a circle which is not magenta and
is a place where a rocket can end a turn.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the rules I've read so far stating what
happens if a rocket coasts in a space which has no place to stop,
just repeated burns one after another. For now I'll watch for Hohmann
intersections and Lagrange points.</p>

<h3 id="year-2"><code>Year 2</code></h3>

<p>Operation: Prospect H6.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Year 2: Lunar Landing. The PRC switches the active
thruster to his crew (output 10•8) for the landing. He
spends 8 fuel steps to enter the lunar lander burn,
leaving him with 2/3 of a tank of fuel. His net thrust
of 10 is greater than the size of Luna, so he makes a
powered landing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier/h9-on-luna.jpg" alt="On Luna" /></p>

<p>Luna requires at least Thrust 9, we have 10, but need to spend 8 steps
of fuel to get that. Moving along the black line on the fuel strip from
8, 8 steps results in 2/3 tank at 4 dry mass.</p>

<p>Note: The TMP should probably have been at 3 for this turn, as the fuel
strip indicates the spacecraft is Scout class. As above, the rocket
stack is on the Playment for photographic convenience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During prospecting, the PRC robonaut
claims Luna (prospecting is automatically successful
since the most you can roll on 1d6 is “6”).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the rules: <strong>H6 - Prospect Operation (Science)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To prospect,
choose a card at the site (or ADJACENT to the site, in the case of
raygun prospecting) that has an ISRU less than or equal to the site
HYDRATION (i.e. number of drops). Then, roll a die. If the result is
less than or equal to the site size, then the prospect is successful; place
a CLAIM DISK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Choosing Cat Fusion Z-pinch Torch has a Buggy ISRU of 2, matching the
2 droplets shown at the site and allowing a re-roll.</p>

<p>Since the site size is 9, and the die goes up to 6, this (and all)
Luna claims automatically succeed with prospecting, given ISRU
values which are allowed.</p>

<p>Whether or not the Claim succeeds, given the ISRU values work,
the site is still available for fuel production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If unsuccessful, place a blue “busted” disk showing
no one may prospect there again. (But you can still perform the SITE
REFUEL OPERATION (H5) there.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="year-3"><code>Year 3</code></h3>

<p>Operation: Refuel H5.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Year 3: ISRU Refueling. The rocket does not have
enough fuel for a lift-off. So the robonaut spends a year
digging up regolith and squeezing out water drop by drop,
moving the fuel figure one step to the right (to 5-2/3). The
stack is divided into an Outpost stack with the robonaut
and steamer, and the Rocket Stack with just the crew.
The dry mass disk and the fuel figure are moved three
steps to the left, to “1” and “2-1/2” respectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the refueling is being done before the stack is separated to
form an outpost. Hence the fuel bump 1 right along the red line,
then back 3 left as the mass is reduced to 1 after separation.</p>

<p>From H5.2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The
number of water or isotope tanks obtained by this
operation equals one plus the site’s HYDRATION
(i.e. number of drops) minus the ISRU rating of the
refueling unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="year-4"><code>Year 4</code></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Year 4: Ticker Tape Return. The crew card (dry mass
= 1, wet mass = 2-1/2) is a “Probe Class” rocket, with
a plus one thrust bonus. This is more than enough for an
powered take-off. Eight steps of fuel are expended to enter
the lunar burn, leaving 2 steps of fuel remaining. This is
insufficient to enter the HEO burn, so the crew takes the
aerobraking “shortcut” to LEO. Assuming their parachute
opens properly, the crew is decommissioned in LEO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Decommissioned cards go back to the players hand, see
D1.6, page 7.</p>

<h3 id="year-5"><code>Year 5</code></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Year 5: The Next Mission. The PRC plans its next
mission, flying a refinery to Luna. Together with the
robonaut already there, an Industrialize Operation
creates an S Factory in Crater Shackleton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TODO: work through the rules for this.</p>

<h3 id="year-6"><code>Year 6</code></h3>

<p>TODO: Industrialize Luna.</p>

<h3 id="year-7"><code>Year 7</code></h3>

<p>TODO: Industrialize Luna.</p>

<h3 id="year-8"><code>Year 8</code></h3>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier/mars-planning.jpg" alt="Mars planning" /></p>

<p>The LEO-to-Mars signpost states 3 burns:</p>

<ol>
  <li>LEO to HEO</li>
  <li>HEO to GEO</li>
  <li>Stop on Hohmann Transfer</li>
  <li>Coast to burn above Mars, through Sol-Mars Lagrange</li>
  <li>Burn to LMO</li>
  <li>Face Aerobrake and Crash hazards</li>
</ol>

<p>TODO: Play this out then industrialize Mars.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The last few games of Leaving Earth have been helpful for understanding
the need for mission planning in High Frontier. In Leaving Earth, I have
mission planning pretty well figured out, at least as far as the
technology stack for accomplishing missions. High Frontier is similar,
but not as convenient. There are more choices to be made, and the way
movement is conducted has enough superficial differences to require
some in-depth study. The notion of having to make burns of different
types in different places is the same. With more experience in High
Frontier I'm sure I'll figure it out pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Many, many questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When do the cards flip from White side to Black side?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose I have a factory on (say) Luna which is pumping out fuel.
Where do I get to use that fuel?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As above, how do I cash out fuel produced from factories elsewhere?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to choose the correct factory?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why leave the Mirror Steamer on Luna? It's Mass 0 so could easily
be flown back to LEO.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Links to good explanations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a great discussion on <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1903615/multiple-activations-single-thruster-turn">how TMP works (including fractional
fuel
costs)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="calling-the-game-here">Calling the game here</h2>

<p>I was hoping to leave this set up for a while, but at the moment, there
is too much going on at work and I'm unable to concentrate on either the
game or on work, so the game needs to be put away for now. I may come
back later and fill in some of the empty blanks.</p>

<p>This play was a major success in several aspects though. I'm comfortable
with how movement works now, the thrust and fuel strips make sense.
Various operations now make more sense. While I still have a number of
questions, I now understand which questions I need to ask and why, which
is a vast improvement. One thing for sure, a good play requires good
planning.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
