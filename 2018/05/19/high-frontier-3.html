High Frontier 3
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 19 2018</time>

<p>I'm slowly teaching myself High Frontier. I don't believe it's a very
difficult game per se, but what the game actually is, is not
communicated clearly. It also can't decide whether it wants to be more
sandbox, or more space race. The 3rd edition rules for my copy have
important differences between first and second edition rules. (I suspect
any future fourth edition will have yet more important differences.)</p>

<p>The main difficulty with the rules is that an overall scope of a typical
space race game is not provided, for either multiplayer or
solitaire. There are solitaire variants in the rules, but some reading
indicates they assume more than passing familiarity with game play.</p>

<p>So we'll give this a shot from the top. Or almost the top.</p>

<p>The year is 2049, and the space race has heated right back up. I'm
operating the NASA agency, and after many years of reearch and
development, I've accumulated 24 Water Tanks (WT), with the following
technology <em>carefully chosen at random</em> from the patent decks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thruster: Ablative Plate, [2 &gt;) 2]</li>
  <li>Robonaut: Nuclear Drill (which also a [5 &gt;) 4] thruster)</li>
  <li>Refinery: Foamglass Sintering</li>
</ul>

<p>The goals for this game are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a factory somewhere.</li>
  <li>Build a freighter and get technology shipped.</li>
  <li>Count the number of years and budget required.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's work through Section C of the Colonization rule
book, which contains the set up information for the Basic Game.</p>

<p>[Notes on my set up for solo game.]</p>

<h3 id="sequence-of-play">Sequence of play</h3>

<p>Each turn is limited to a single move (of possibly many burns)
for each of the two basic game spacecraft, a single operation, and
as many free actions as a player desires. Movement, Operations
and Free Actions will be explained in more detail as this story
unfolds.</p>

<p>From online forums, it seems like Hertha, an asteroid in the Nysa group
is a common target for starting the game. So that's what I'll plan a
mission for as well.</p>

<h4 id="section">2049</h4>

<p>Operation: Boost to LEO the robonaut and thruster.</p>

<p>Since I have the WTs, I'll make some burns to get to Hertha. It takes 4
burns to go out.</p>

<h4 id="section-1">2050</h4>

<p>Operation: Boost Robonaut, Thruster and Refinery to LEO. Gain 1 WT
because NASA.</p>

<p>Movement: Will use Ablative Plate Thruster, and load everything up for
the trip. Super heavy, Dry Mass is 10. We'll need Wet Mass to equal 17
to get the 4 burns necessary to get to Hertha. This puts the rocket
into -2 thrust, spend a WT to get 1 thrust back. Will be a long trip.
First burn through HEO. Wet Mass is 15.</p>

<h4 id="section-2">2051</h4>

<p>Operation: Research, auction a Carbo-Chlorination Refinery, pay 0.
Doesn't look very interesting to me right now. Will sell it next turn.</p>

<p>Burn 2 through Earth-Luna Lagrange, Wet Mass 13.</p>

<h4 id="section-3">2052</h4>

<p>Operation: Free Market, sell the Refinery for 5 WT.</p>

<p>Movement: perform Burn 3, Wet Mass 11.</p>

<h4 id="section-4">2053</h4>

<p>Operation: Research, Neutral Beam Robonaut, mass 5, ISRU 2 with Raygun.
Interesting, might keep this one.</p>

<p>Burn 4, Wet Mass 10 and hold on Hohmann Transfer.</p>

<h4 id="section-5">2054</h4>

<p>Operation: Research, ISRU Sabatier, mass 4, class V. Also looks
interesting, meet keep, will have to see what else comes up in the
patent decks. At my hand limit now.</p>

<p>Move to next Hohmann pivot.</p>

<h4 id="section-6">2055</h4>

<p>Change to Nuclear Drill robonaut thruster to land on Hertha.
There is no landing burn, thrust is 5 - 1. Land on Hertha.</p>

<p>Leave the Ablative Plate thruster as an outpost on the
Hohmann Transfer above Hertha.</p>

<p>Operation: Prospect, roll 5 but pretend it's 3 so this game can play out
a bit longer and get to industrial. So we have a claim on Hertha.</p>

<h4 id="section-7">2056</h4>

<p>Operation: Industrialize, decommission, now I have 4 cards in my hand,
which means I need to discard one. Should have boosted the crew to LEO.
Will discard Foamglass Sintering Refinery.</p>

<p><strong>Note: discarding was a mistake, I can have as many cards as I want
in my hand, I just can't bid with more than 3 cards in hand. I should
have held on to the Foamglass Sintering and sold it back for 5 WT.</strong></p>

<h4 id="section-8">2057</h4>

<p>Operation: ET Production, produce Helical Railgun robonaut, which is
ISRU 0 and a dirt Thruster. We're in business now. Need to fuel up
some dirt. Not sure what to do with the thruster in the outpost, it
doesn't have any fuel. Actually, next turn I can fuel up with dirt,
then the turn after that, fuel up with WT.</p>

<h4 id="section-9">2058</h4>

<p>Operation: Produce 20 dirt tanks.</p>

<p>Decommission outpost and return Ablative Plate to hand.</p>

<p>Fuel the Helical Railgun with 20 DT, Dry Mass 5, Wet Mass 25.
Thrust is 5 - 2 = 3, no afterburner. Launch to HEO. Will stay
here to save on fuel.</p>

<h4 id="section-10">2059</h4>

<p>Move to Hohmann intersection, we're off to Cere group next.</p>

<p>Operation: Boost crew card and Ablative Plate to LEO for 5 WT.</p>

<h4 id="section-11">2060</h4>

<p>Move along path towards Ceres, 2 burns to get to the Hohmann
intersection right at Gefion. This is good, more thrust as
Wet Mass decreases.</p>

<p>Operation: Research Photon Heliogyra.</p>

<h4 id="section-12">2061</h4>

<p>Move to next Hohmann intersection.</p>

<p>Operation: Research refinery CVD Molding.</p>

<h4 id="section-13">2062</h4>

<p>Move to Ceres HEO, 1 burn, Wet Mass now 12.</p>

<p>Operation: Orbital Prospect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ceres: automatic.</li>
  <li>Gefion: roll 3, busted.</li>
  <li>Miahelena: roll 4, busted.</li>
  <li>Minerva: roll 6, busted.</li>
  <li>Aegis: roll 5, busted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where to next?</p>

<p>Let's land and fuel on gefion.</p>

<h4 id="section-14">2063</h4>

<p>Operation: +10 fuel on Gefion, Wet Mass now 22, Thrust 3.</p>

<p>Move to Hohmann past burn, Wet Mass 18.</p>

<h4 id="section-15">2064</h4>

<p>Operation: Boost Heliogyra and CVD molding to LEO.</p>

<p>Move: Hohmann intersection between blue and green trajectories.</p>

<h4 id="section-16">2065</h4>

<p>Operation: Free Electron Laser robonaut.</p>

<p>Move: Hohmann intersection at Koronis.</p>

<h4 id="section-17">2066</h4>

<p>Move: 3 burns to get to Vesta HEO, Wet Mass 8 1/2.</p>

<p>Operation: Prospect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vesta automatic.</li>
  <li>Eichsfeldia: roll 3, claimed.</li>
  <li>Kollaa: roll 5, busted.</li>
  <li>Peking: roll 1, claimed.</li>
  <li>Unitas: roll 6, busted.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd like to continue this, but I have some Real Life
obligations requiring that the game get put away for now,
so calling this game here.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>A few takeaways from this game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Since movement isn't an operation, any time a rocket is sitting on a
Hohmann intersection is a good time to run operations such as Income,
Research, Boost, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prospecting is chancy early in the game, and high ISRU technology
makes it difficult to exploit many locations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rule books continue to frustrate, with some variant and advanced
game rules lodged into the basic game rules sections. The Basic Game
would be easier for me to understand if they were strictly limited to
the Basic game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hand size dictates when Research and bidding occur, there is no limit
to the number of cards in hand otherwise.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
