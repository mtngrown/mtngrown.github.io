Fire in the Lake (13) and more at EGO
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 27 2018</time>
<p>Fire in the Lake, on the table again! We're really starting to dig into
the game play, with my usual opponent AS taking the VC/NVA forces. In
the past, he's almost always taken the US/ARVN side and often done quite
well. Personally, I think in the short game, the NVA is the hardest one
to win at, one bad round really hurts.</p>

<p>We made it through about 16-18 cards, the last Coup card came up pretty
quick. This benefitted me as the US as I had reduced committment quite a
bit at the second Coup. Had the third round gone several more cards, the
game might have gone to the VC.</p>

<p>There is still quite a lot left in the game to learn. The side effects
and coupling continue to confound.</p>

<p>After Fire in the Lake, we played a few shorter games, as follows.</p>

<h3 id="think-thrice">Think Thrice</h3>

<p>Think Thrice is a basically unknown game. The online forum where I
investigate games has 7 owners listed for the game. I don't think it's
all that great of a game, but it is very small, travel-sized in fact,
which is convenient. I also cannot recall how I came to acquire the
game. In any case, we played twice.</p>

<p>Game 1: Neither of us really grokked the rules that well, but we laid
out the tiles and commenced. After figuring out that some of the rules
made no sense at all, we came up with a set of workable alternatives,
and AS won.</p>

<p>Game 2: After some reflection, we decided that we were playing it wrong
in the first game, and made a couple more rule changes after which the game
seemed logically consistent. AS won this game as well.</p>

<h3 id="star-realms---colony-wars">Star Realms - Colony Wars</h3>

<p>Our go-to game when we have 15 minutes. The usual transpired here.</p>

<p>Game 1: I got beat bad, AS picked up a 6 damage blob on the first turn,
and that set the pace for the game. I was unable to deal with it and
lost down 35+ points. Pretty bad even for me, I usually manage to get a
bit closer.</p>

<p>Game 2: This second game went a lot better for me. Although I still
lost, I didn't lose as badly. Had the cards played slightly differently,
I might well have won it. This is my usual loss to this opponent,
getting behind one round on the hands.</p>

<p>All in all a pretty good day.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
