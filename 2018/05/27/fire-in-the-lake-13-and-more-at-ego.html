<p>Fire in the Lake, on the table again! We're really starting to dig into
the game play, with my usual opponent AS taking the VC/NVA forces. In
the past, he's almost always taken the US/ARVN side and often done quite
well. Personally, I think in the short game, the NVA is the hardest one
to win at, one bad round really hurts.</p>

<p>We made it through about 16-18 cards, the last Coup card came up pretty
quick. This benefitted me as the US as I had reduced committment quite a
bit at the second Coup. Had the third round gone several more cards, the
game might have gone to the VC.</p>

<p>There is still quite a lot left in the game to learn. The side effects
and coupling continue to confound.</p>

<p>After Fire in the Lake, we played a few shorter games, as follows.</p>

<h3 id="think-thrice">Think Thrice</h3>

<p>Think Thrice is a basically unknown game. The online forum where I
investigate games has 7 owners listed for the game. I don't think it's
all that great of a game, but it is very small, travel-sized in fact,
which is convenient. I also cannot recall how I came to acquire the
game. In any case, we played twice.</p>

<p>Game 1: Neither of us really grokked the rules that well, but we laid
out the tiles and commenced. After figuring out that some of the rules
made no sense at all, we came up with a set of workable alternatives,
and AS won.</p>

<p>Game 2: After some reflection, we decided that we were playing it wrong
in the first game, and made a couple more rule changes after which the game
seemed logically consistent. AS won this game as well.</p>

<h3 id="star-realms---colony-wars">Star Realms - Colony Wars</h3>

<p>Our go-to game when we have 15 minutes. The usual transpired here.</p>

<p>Game 1: I got beat bad, AS picked up a 6 damage blob on the first turn,
and that set the pace for the game. I was unable to deal with it and
lost down 35+ points. Pretty bad even for me, I usually manage to get a
bit closer.</p>

<p>Game 2: This second game went a lot better for me. Although I still
lost, I didn't lose as badly. Had the cards played slightly differently,
I might well have won it. This is my usual loss to this opponent,
getting behind one round on the hands.</p>

<p>All in all a pretty good day.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
