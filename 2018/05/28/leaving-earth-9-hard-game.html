Leaving Earth 9, hard game
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 28 2018</time>
<p>Upshot: next game, don't forget to plan the haulage into Earth Orbit.</p>

<p>First hard game in a while. I'm going to put my new mission planning
skills to work for this one. It's done in three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Calculate mission thrust and rocket requirements.</li>
  <li>Determine timeline.</li>
  <li>Determine cost vs. risk.</li>
</ol>

<p>The missions are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Easy: Man in Space, 2.</li>
  <li>Easy: Artificial Satellite, 2.</li>
  <li>Easy: Sounding Rocket, 1.</li>
  <li>Medium: Space Station, 6.</li>
  <li>Medium: Venus Lander, 11.</li>
  <li>Medium: Mercury Lander, 13.</li>
  <li>Hard: Venus Station, 27.</li>
  <li>Hard: Man on Venus, 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is an interesting set of missions. There is no way to win the game
without making at least one of the Venus missions. Succeeding on the
Man on Venus mission probably gets everything but the Mercury Lander
mission as a by-product.</p>

<p>The main planning exercise becomes getting a man to Venus and back, with
the added criterion of having the man on Venus for one year to satisfy
the Venus Station mission. Burly. Will be hard to test everything up
front, and it's not clear at the start whether Saturn or Soyuz is the
better vehicle.</p>

<p>An interesting wrinkle on the Venus mission is whether to take an Eagle
or an Aldrin Capsule. The Eagle is mass 1, the Aldrin is mass 3, and
that matters for the accumulated difficulty of the mission. I'm going to
try an Eagle capsule for this one, and hope that the radiation doesn't
kill the crew. The Aldrin provides some radiation protection, perhaps
try that next time.</p>

<p>These are the Advancements which need to be obtained to enable

<ol>
  <li>Saturn</li>
  <li>Soyuz</li>
  <li>Atlas</li>
  <li>Landing (almost surely use Juno for testing)</li>
  <li>Rendezvous</li>
  <li>Life Support</li>
</ol>

<p>This is $60-$70.</p>

<p>Not sure how to apportion the spending yet, taking this to a
spreadsheet.</p>

<h3 id="section"><code>1956</code></h3>

<p>Purchase:</p>

<p>Test fire the Saturn with the capsules as payload, Success.
Now there are 3 Capsules in Earth Orbit, and I can get a look at what's
in the Outcome deck for Life Support.</p>

<p>This leaves me with $7, so purchase another Atlas, and
Supplies x 2.</p>

<p>Time to check Life Support:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Eagle: Major Failure.</li>
  <li>Eagle: Major Failure.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is interesting: I don't know whether these need to be brought back
to Earth or not. I do know I cannot pull them down this year as Life
Support testing is at the end of the year, they will have to drop down
next year.</p>

<h3 id="section-4"><code>1960</code></h3>

<p>Drop the Eagle Capsules back to Earth to get automatically fixed at the
end of the turn. This can be done because the Manuever is 0 Difficulty
and the Landing Hazard is optional.</p>

<p>Rendezvous, Minor Failure, purchase.</p>

<p>Life Support test, Success. Life Support is now fully tested.</p>

<p>So many failures this game, way more than successes</p>

<p>At this point I need to figure out how much more stuff I need to get
into Earth Orbit and get it up there. I'm running out of time.</p>

<h3 id="section-12"><code>1968</code></h3>

<p>Boost Saturn into Earth Orbit.</p>

<p>Purchase:</p>

<h3 id="section-15"><code>1971</code></h3>

<p>Fix Atlas.</p>

<p>Purchase Saturn.</p>

<p>Now I need to get some rockets into orbit. I'm running out of time. My
planning didn't work correctly, and I failed to plan how to get stuff
into orbit in time. I'm also out of head space for planning, it's Monday
afternoon, and have to go back to work tomorrow, it's time to wrap this
thing up. I'm going to shoot for Venus Station and not worry about
bringing them back. Which is disappointing.</p>

<p>Two Saturns boost 3 Atlas, 7 Supplies, a Capsule, Aldrin and Armstrong
into Earth Orbit. Roll 3 &amp; 6 to pass Suborbital hazard.</p>

<p>Rendezvous with Saturn/Soyuz rocket: Major Failure. Having Armstrong
as Pilot reduces that to Minor Failure, but still, what a hassle. Buzz
can fix it next turn, but it prevents starting the mission to Venus
this turn. Bummer.</p>

<p>Purchase: Atlas.</p>

<h3 id="section-16"><code>1972</code></h3>

<p>Achieve Space Station, score 6 points.</p>

<p>Score: 9.</p>

<p>Fix Atlas in Orbit.</p>

<p>Purchase Soyuz, test fire, Success, purchased.</p>

<p>Fire Saturn to Inner Planets.</p>

<p>Roll for radiation hazard, 5 &amp; 3, both are fine.</p>

<p>Purchase Atlas.</p>

<p>Take Time token off.</p>

<h3 id="section-17"><code>1973</code></h3>

<p>Purchase Soyuz and test fire, Success. Amazing.</p>

<p>Fire the two Soyuz to get to Venus Orbit next turn.</p>

<p>Purchase Juno Advancement and 2 Juno. Test fire 1, Success,
second, Success.</p>

<p>Roll for radiation hazard, 8 &amp; 8.</p>

<p>Time Token off.</p>

<h3 id="section-18"><code>1974</code></h3>

<p>Venus landing, taking down 2 Supplies, both Astronauts, the
capsule and two Atlas. I won't need the Atlas as I'm calling the game
here regardless. Draw Landing Outcome: Major Failure. Dang. Armstrong
gets me a Minor Failure, since I dropped two supplies, I should be able
to fix the craft with one, and survive the year with the other.</p>

<p>This scores me Venus Lander for 11 points.</p>

<p>Score: 20.</p>

<h3 id="section-19"><code>1975</code></h3>

<p>Having astronauts on Venus at beginning of year scores another 27
points.</p>

<p>Score: 47.</p>

<p>I can do a Man in Space mission with pilot Alan Shepard, Minor Failure
on Landing (not that I needed to do that, could have brought him back in
on parachute). Unremitting. But this bumps my score up 2 points.</p>

<p>Score: 49.</p>

<h3 id="section-20"><code>1976</code></h3>

<p>Game over.</p>

<p>Final score is 49/94, which is a win.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>What I did not do well is determine how much gear I needed to get into
Earth Orbit. Once I had the mission planned from Earth Orbit out, I just
started winging it.</p>

<p>What I didn't do is plan how to get all that gear into Earth Orbit. That
was a serious problem. I managed to "win" regardless, but it still
annoys me that I didn't do that planning as well. Getting rockets into
Earth Orbit is a pretty big deal. Next game I'm going to focus on that.</p>

<p>It would have been nice to have gotten the Mercury Lander as well, but
given the outcome draws, I suspect the attempt would have failed.</p>

<p>However, it turns out that Venus is too inhospitable, and landing
spacecraft are destroyed. This reduces the possible points to 35.</p>

<p>If the Venus Lander is allowed, it's a victory with 22/35.</p>

<p>If the Venus Lander is not allowed, it's a loss with 11/24.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
