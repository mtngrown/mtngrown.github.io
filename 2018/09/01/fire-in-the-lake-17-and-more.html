<p>The long awaited day where we had the time to set up the long game and
play as many coup rounds as it took. As had been usual lately, I took
ARVN/US, the usual opponent took VC/NVA.</p>

<p>We made it to the second Coup.</p>

<p>It turns out those sneaky VC managed to get all their bases on the
mapâ€¦and with a couple of real sweet events, managed to turn on just
enough opposition to score 36.</p>

<p>And we had the whole day!</p>

<p>Dammit.</p>

<p>Enough of this COIN businss. Silver Bayonet is going into rotation
starting right now. We'll get back to Fire in the Lake when we can team
up on a couple of buddies, maybe later this fall.</p>

<h2 id="more-games">More games</h2>

<p>As is usual when we finish early, we play a number of much shorted
games, mostly brainless. It's a nice counter point to heavy games to
follow with very fast playing games. Here's the list.</p>

<h3 id="think-thrice">Think Thrice</h3>

<p>Think Thrice seems sort of a dumb game, and maybe it is. Certainly, the
rules-as-written are not playable, at least to us. However, given the
colorful tiles, we've managed to create a decent little game out of it.</p>

<p>Here are our rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The tiles can be laid down in either all same or all different colors
and patterns, to a three-in-a-row limit.</li>
  <li>Either:
    <ol>
      <li>Play one or more tiles, or</li>
      <li>draw a tile.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Completing a triad with the last tile wins the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>We played two games, I won the first, AS won the second.</p>

<p>First game, my win:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/think-thrice/g4.jpg" alt="Think Thrice game 4" /></p>

<p>Second game, AS win:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/think-thrice/g5.jpg" alt="Think Thrice game 5" /></p>

<h3 id="quirkle">Quirkle</h3>

<p>Qwirkle is Think Thrice's bigger, but possibly not necessarily better,
brother. AS smoked me on this game. I'm sure I would get better at it
with more plays, but it requires scoring during play, which I'm not a
fan of. I'm willing to play it again, but it's not something I intend
on acquiring for myself.</p>

<h3 id="zombie-dice">Zombie Dice</h3>

<p>Played Double Feature and Lunch Wagon. I won this one, 15 to 10! I
usually don't win at Zombie Dice. This was Game 30.</p>

<h3 id="the-agents">The Agents</h3>

<p>It's been a while since we fired up The Agents, and it took a few rounds
during this game to get back into the rules. Once we got started it went
pretty well. Still a unique game, haven't played anything like it still.</p>

<p>I won this game pretty handily, but we're putting it into rotation, so
we'll be playing a lot more of it in the future.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
