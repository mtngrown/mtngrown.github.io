StarForce 12, The Rescue Mission (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep  2 2018</time>
<p>It has been quite a while since I've had StarForce on the table, and
I've been looking forward to digging into the Rescue Scenario for quite
some time. It's a bona fide solitaire scenario, racing a randomized
clock.</p>

<p>At the moment, I have it set up and ready to go for a deep dive tomorrow
(Labor Day holiday in US).</p>

<p>On the table is "The Rescue Mission," as detailed in Section 38 of the
rules. The star going nova is 2922, denoted CD-36 on the map. It's
well-positioned, with a little bit of luck, should be able to get a
significant fraction rescued.</p>

<p>At the outset of play, this scenario seems to have a fair bit of replay
value. Some of the possible initial starting systems (stars which would
go nova) are way out in the boondocks.</p>

<p>I suspect that mastering this scenario will help me do well against
opponents, as all the different movement tricks will need to be
employed.</p>

<p>Here's what it looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/starforce/g12-start.jpg" alt="StarForce Rescue start, game 12" /></p>

<h3 id="scenario-specific-rules">Scenario-specific rules</h3>

<p>The following are provided for the Rescue scenario:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A star force must begin and end it's turn in a system to either
pick up or offload a group of colonists.</li>
  <li>Each star force carries one Population Point.</li>
  <li>All shifting is allowed.</li>
  <li>Enhancing operations may not be performed by any star force which
is loading or unloading. This is probably moot as unloading would be
at a system which already has a gate. It might be possible to extend
incoming capacity though, by enhancing at 2922.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="abridged-turn-sequence">Abridged turn sequence</h3>

<p>From Section 5.0:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Plot stellar shifts.</li>
  <li>Execute shifts.</li>
  <li>Combat if applicable.</li>
  <li>Neutralization recovery if applicable.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>I'm going to group various star forces together by originating stellar
system to make it easier to manage.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sol group (black, G, H, J, K): will shift directly into 2922, it's less than
20 hexes.</li>
  <li>Nova group (yellow, A, B, C, D) will sit tight for now, onboarding
population.</li>
  <li>Green group (V, W) can shift directly into 2922, it's close enough.</li>
  <li>Dragon group (blue, E, F) can gatelink to a system very close by.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nova draw: 6.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Sol group stays put and loads.</li>
  <li>Green group loads.</li>
  <li>Nova group GS to 3424 Ross 780</li>
  <li>Dragon group shifts in to 2922.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nova draw: 5.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3.</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Nova group unloads at 3424.</li>
  <li>Green group unloads at 3220</li>
  <li>Sol group shifts to 3024.</li>
  <li>Dragon group loads.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nova draw: 7.</p>

<p>Score: 4.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Sol group unload at 3024.</li>
  <li>Green group unload at 3220.</li>
  <li>Nova group moves back to 2922.</li>
  <li>Dragon group moves to 3325-5.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nova draw: 8.</p>

<p>Score: 10.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Nova group loads.</li>
  <li>Dragon group unloads.</li>
  <li>Sol group to 2922.</li>
  <li>Green group to 2922.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nova draw: 3.</p>

<p>Score: 12.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Nova group to 3424-4.</li>
  <li>Dragon group to 2922.</li>
  <li>Sol group loads.</li>
  <li>Green group loads.</li>
</ol>

<p>Draw: 0, 0!</p>

<p>Game ends!</p>

<p>Score: 12.</p>

<p>Bummer!</p>

<p>At least this game ended this evening, or I'd have to move the article
by date.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This scenario also reminds me a bit of Leaving Earth, insofar as there
is an optimization problem buried in the scenario. In Leaving Earth,
movement is very simple, but the logistics of managing the missions are
quite complex. Here in StarForce, there is only star forces and star
gates to manage, but the movement possibilities are much more involved.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
