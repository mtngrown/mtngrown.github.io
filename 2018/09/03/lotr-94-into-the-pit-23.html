LotR 94 - Into the Pit (23)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep  3 2018</time>
<p>After taking a break for a couple of months, I'm back at Into the Pit,
so far the most difficult scenario I've played given my own devices.</p>

<p>The deck I'm using is my own, new Dwarf deck, which focuses on getting
through the East-gate on the first or second turn. No idea how it will
perform after that.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ancestral Knowledge</li>
  <li>Narvi's Belt</li>
  <li>Ancestral Knowledge</li>
  <li>King Under the Mountain</li>
  <li>Fili</li>
  <li>Erebor Record Keeper</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial encounter draw: Goblin Swordsman.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Durin's Song.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor, and Durin's Song on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori and Erebor, 11 Will, draw Fouled Well discard Fili.
Net 7 Progress, clears East-gate.</li>
  <li>Travel: First Hall, Threat 34.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends, draw Dreadful Gap for no Shadow, Dain takes no
hits.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35, exhaust Cave Torch, draw Dark and Dreadful for no
effect.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Durin's Song.</li>
  <li>Planning: none this round, save Resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin and Ori, draw Zigil Mineshaft. Play Cave Torch
to add Progress to Zigi, draw Goblin Follower. Increase Threat
to 37 for two more Progress on Zigil to clear it. Net 3 Progress
clearing First Hall and putting Bridge of Khazad-Dum in Staging.
Entering the Mines has 1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Bridge of Khazad Dum.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Swordsman and Goblin Follower.</li>
  <li>Combat: Exhaust Erebor to ready Ori, play Durin's Song on Ori to
get extra defense. Draw Shadow Signs of Conflict, Threat 38, no
hits on Ori. Dain defends Goblin Swordsman, shadow Many Roads for
no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: Resource 5, draw Longbeard Orc Slayer.</li>
  <li>Planning: Employ Cave Torch to clear Bridge of Khazad Dum, draw
Goblin Scout. Play Longbeard.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, draw Crumbling Ruin, exhaust Longbeard and draw
Gandalf. That's tough, could be the game right here as I'm about
to get hammered.</li>
  <li>Travel: Fouled Well.</li>
  <li>Encounter: All.</li>
  <li>Combat: Ori Defends Goblin Scout, shadow Goblin Scout for
no effect and no damage to Ori. Thorin defends Goblin Swordsman,
draw shadow Lightless Passage for no effect, Thorin takes 2 hits.
Dain defends Goblin Follower, shadow Crumbling Ruin for no effect,
Dain takes no hits.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once again I'm unable to get the Dwarf swarm running. I've <em>never</em> been
able to get a Dwarf swarm. I always lose too many characters early on
then threat out or something. This was really painful as well, because
I never got any real benefit from Longbeard, almost the same as just
throwing away 4 resources.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Dunedain Quest.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, draw Branching Paths. Net +2, which
clears Fouled Well.</li>
  <li>Travel: Fouled Well. Exhaust Erebor to ready Thorin.</li>
  <li>Encounter: all.</li>
  <li>Combat: Ori defend Goblin Scout, shadow Goblin Swordsman which
is added to the Staging Area for no further effect. Looking grim
though. Thorin defends Goblin Swordsman, shadow Watchful Eyes for
no effect, Thorin gets two more hits. Dain defends Goblin Follower,
shadow Goblin Tunnels for +3 attack, Dain take 2 hits.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't see any way I can dig out of this hole, just don't have
enough resources.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play King Under the Mountain on Dain draw Fili and
Map-maker discard Map-maker.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, draw Goblin Follower. No way to win now.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: 5 enemy, forget it.</li>
  <li>Combat:</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat</li>
</ol>

<p>The next play, I'm going to concentrate on digging dwarves out of the
deck, then worry about clearing locations.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
