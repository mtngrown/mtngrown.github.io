LotR 95 - Into the Pit (24)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep  3 2018</time>
<p>More adjustments to dwarf deck, almost half allies now, going to try
hard to get the swarm going without regard to anything else. I'm
interested to see what happens if I can get the swarm actually played.
If so, I may be able to catch up on locations and whatnot.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Fili</li>
  <li>Gloin</li>
  <li>Erebor Record Keeper</li>
  <li>Second Breakfast</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial encounter draw: Many Roads, which is no effect buts swarms for
Patrol Leader, which is a bummer.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Longbeard Map-maker.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Erebor.</li>
  <li>Quest: All, draw Stairs of Nain, net +4 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Narvi's Belt.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Fili, which is to play Kili as well.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorn and Ori, draw Watchful Eyes which goes on Dain,
and that's ok for now. Net 0 on questing.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Erebor Hammersmith and Kili.</li>
  <li>Planning: Narvi's Belt on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, draw Goblin Swordsman. Net +1 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Erebor Record Keeper and Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor Record Keeper and Gloin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, Kili and Gloin for 12 Will, draw Crumbling Ruin,
exhaust Erebor Record Keeper, draw Narvi's Belt and discard Record
Keeper. This clears East-gate and puts 4 on quest card.</li>
  <li>Travel: First Hall, Threat 37.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Patrol Leader and Goblin Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Combat: Fili defends Patrol Leader, shadow Goblin Swordsman which
goes to Staging and Fili is dead. Thorin defends Goblin Swordsman,
shadow Branching Paths for no effect, Thorin takes 2 hits.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Durin's Song and Dori.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Dori and Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin and Ori for 7 Will, draw Goblin Follower. Dang.
Already too many enemies. If I don't get a Gandalf to take one
of these out, I'm in trouble. Net +3 to clear First Hall and
add 1 to quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: Stairs of Nain. Can't risk Bridge of Khazad Dum yet.</li>
  <li>Encounter: This is going to suck. I have 4 enemies engaged, and there
is nothing I can do other than suck it up and take the damage.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends Patrol Leader, shadow Cave In for no effect and
one hit on Dain. Kili defends Goblin Follower, shadow Dark and Dreadful,
Kili finished. Gloin defends Goblin Swordsman, shadow Branching Paths
for no effect, Gloin takes 2 hits. Erebor Hammersmith defends against
Goblin Swordsman, shadow Goblin Scout for no effect, Hammersmith
takes 2 hits. Pay 1 lore to ready Thorin from exhausting Record Keeper.
Play Durin's Song on Thorin to get enough hits to kill Goblin Follower.
Draw Dark and Dreadful for Watchful Eyes, this kills so many I'm now
under 5 in play again. I think that's the game because I'm too low
on resources to get enough into play next turn, and there are too
many enemies to deal with. We'll see.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Second Breakfast.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Zigil Mineshafter, play Cave Torch and draw
Stairs of Nain, increase threat to clear it, Threat 41, add
three more for Threat 44 from Bridge of Khazad Dum.</li>
  <li>Travel: none</li>
  <li>Encounter: all in staging.</li>
  <li>Combat: Erobor defends Goblin Swordsman, shadow Signs of Conflict
Threat 46 and 2 hits on Hammersmith. Dori defends Patrol Leader, shadow
Lightless Passage for no effect, but Dori takes 3 hits and is dead.
Ori defends Goblin Swordsman, shadow Goblin Tunnels for +3 Attack,
Ori is dead.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 47.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have no chance so I'm stopping here.</p>

<p>I almost got a swarm going. I think I'm going to do stats on this
scenario, count all the cards to get an idea of relative frequency
of, for example, enemies. I keep getting wiped off the board. From
counting, there are 15 enemies in this deck. The last two games,
I think I've drawn a bit more than average.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
