  <li>Henamarth Riversong</li>
  <li>Longbeard Orc Slayer</li>

  <li>Bifur</li>
  <li>Cram</li>
</ul>

<p>Initial encounter: New Devilry, since Stage 1 discard
and reveal Undisturbed Bones for no effect. <em>A Presence
in the Dark</em> goes to Victory, <em>Heading Down</em> is up next.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Henamarth, scry Crumbling Ruin. Play
Cram on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin and Ori, draw Crumbling Ruin, exhaust Dain.
Net +5 Progress which clears <em>Heading Down</em>.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Dwarven Tomb.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry New Devilry. Play Longbeard.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, and Longbeard for 8, draw
New Devilry, shuffle and redraw <em>Heading Up</em>.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Durin's Song and Kili.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Massing in the Deed, will need to keep
another Ally ready just in case. Play Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, and Erebor for 9 Will, draw
Massing in Deed and New Devilry, will take the shuffle
and draw Escape from Darkness. Dang. Also, Threat 34.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Miner of the Iron Hills and Dori.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Pundered Armory. Play Gloin, 2 R back
on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin and Ori for 7 Will, draw Plundered Armory
for net +1.</li>
  <li>Travel: Plundered Armory.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Switch Stage card to <em>Narrow Paths</em>.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Kili and Narvi's Belt.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Goblin Spearman. Play Narvi's Belt
on Thorin. Play Kili to find Fili.</li>
  <li>Quest: Technically, because <em>Narrow Paths</em> was revealed
during the previous Combat phase, the When Revealed from last
turn should not apply to this turn. Hence, quest Thorin, Ori,
Gloin, Fili, and Kili for 14, draw Goblin Swordsman net 9 to
clear Plundered Armory and put Progress on <em>Narrow Paths</em>.
Search Encounter deck for Abandoned Tools. <em>A Wrong Turn</em>
comes up next, draw Orc Drummer.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Combat: Longbeard defends against Goblin Swordsman, shadow
Shadow of Fear for no effect, Longbeard takes 1 hit.
Shuffle Stage deck, draw <em>A Wrong Turn</em> again, draw Chance
Encounter to put Goblin Swordsman back into play and engaged.
Exhaust Dain to acquire Abandoned Tools.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Erebor Hammersmith and Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Great Cave Troll. Play Dori.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, Gloin, Fili, Kili for 14 Will, draw Great
Cave Troll for 9 Threat, clear <em>A Wrong Turn</em>. The next
Stage is <em>Blocked by Shadow</em> which I think will just go right
to the bottom of the Staging deck, which results in <em>Heading
Down</em> getting shuffled back in. No big deal.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Combat: Longbeard defend, shadow Goblin Archer for no effect,
Longbeard takes another hit. Dain, Erebor, and Dori kill Goblin
Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Longbeard Map-Maker and Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Goblin Spearman. Play Gandalf, Threat 33.
Play Cram on Thorin, exhaust Narvi's Belt to play Erebor
Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, and Gloin for 10 Will, draw Goblin
Spearman for +1 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Engage Great Cave Troll, Goblin Spearman.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gandalf defends Great Cave Troll, shadow Dark
and Dreadful for 1 hit to Gandalf, +7 Attack, Gandalf is
dead. Erebor Hammersmith defends against Goblin Spearman,
shadow Stray Goblin for +1 Attack, 2 hits on Erebor. Discard
Cram to ready Thorin, attack Great Cave Troll with total 15
to kill it.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Untroubled by Darkness and again.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Shadow of Fear.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, Gloin, Erebor (1), Fili, Kili
for 16 Will, draw Shadow of Fear and attach to Dain.
Total Threat is 10, net +6 which clears <em>Heading Up</em>.
Next staging card is <em>Hasty Council</em> which demands
putting all copies of A Foe Beyond from the discard pile
shuffled into the encounter deck. Since I have none,
I am very lucky this time. I need to win this scenario
very soon now, or it's going to get me. The staging
cards are <em>Heading Down</em> and <em>Blocked by Shadow</em>. I'll
put <em>Heading Down</em> at the bottom, which leaves <em>Blocked
by Shadow</em>, which also goes to the bottom, which reveals
<em>Escape from Darkness</em>. It will take 4 rounds to clear
this card, I can do this with the number of allies
I have in play, I don't need to make progres, just not
to threat out.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Erebor defends Goblin Spearman, shadow Dark
and Dreadful, which kills Erebor. Longbeard and Dori
kill Goblin Spearman.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

  <li>Planning: Scry Fouled Well. Detach Abandoned Tools
to Staging from Dain. Play Miner of the Iron Hills to
get rid of Shadow of Fear. Exhaust Ori to claim Abandoned Tools,
this will cost me an extra round…except, Cram on Ori.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, exhaust lots, discard Cram to place
Progress on <em>Escape from Darkness</em>. Draw Fouled Well.</li>
  <li>Travel: Fouled Well, discard Bifur.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Miner of the Iron Hills and Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Goblin Spearman. Play Unexpected Courage on Ori.</li>

  <li>Planning: Scry Goblin Spearman. Play Longbeard Orc Slayer
to put 1 hit on Orc Drummer which sends that bad boy to
the discard pile. Exhaust Ori to place 1 P on <em>Escape from
Darkness</em> for the win.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This was a long game! It was also far easier than I thought it would be
given it's rated much more difficult than either Into the Pit or The
Seventh Level. It is sort of fitting that this marks my 100th play of
the game though.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I could have won this probably on Round 9 or 10
had Ori picked up Abandoned Tools instead of Dain, given I drew
and attached Unexpected Courage right after that. I could have
been using Unexpected Courage to refresh and place as well (I'm
pretty sure this is legal, it doesn't say anything about when
Progress can be placed on the stage).</p>

<p>It's also a bit hard to believe I won this on my first play.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
