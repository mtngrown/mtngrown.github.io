Ogre: 5 years of Nuclear Powered Rage
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov  3 2018</time>
<p>Blowout Ogre day at Endgame to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Ogre
Designer Edition's release. This is the game which really got my hobby
interest started. We hadn't played as a group for a while, and I had not
played it in over a year so it was time to get a group together and go
at it.</p>

<h3 id="gev-escort">GEV Escort</h3>

<p>The GEV Escort scenario is from the Steve Jackson-designed scenarios
from Book 3. It's a slightly augmented classic "kill the command post"
exercise with the attacking Ogre getting some GEVs, and the defender
getting a few more units as well.</p>

<p>Three games of this in total, all against the same opponent SK, who is a
master at the Ogre/GEV ecosystem. I rarely win against SK, can't recall
I've ever won against him in fact.</p>

<h4 id="game-1">Game 1</h4>

<p>Hunkered down in an attempt to get first fire, which I did, but
with no progress up the map, the Ogre was swarmed, the GEVs killed
and there was no chance so I conceded.</p>

<p>A depressing start!</p>

<h4 id="game-2">Game 2</h4>

<p>Straight up the middle, GEVs from the corners. Two GEVs were
taken out without firing a shot, conceded the game. There was just no
possible way to win given the attacker retained his augmented forces.</p>

<h4 id="game-3">Game 3</h4>

<p>Straight up the middle, GEVs in flying wedge. This puts a lot of heat on
the Ogre pretty fast, but saves the GEVs to be a harrying force, which
was moderately successful.</p>

<p>Here's what the wedge looked like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ogre/gev-escort-wedge.jpg" alt="GEV Escort" /></p>

<p>Still no dice, was not able to flank with GEVs as desired.</p>

<p>After this set of games, I'd had enough of getting thrashed. Time to
move on to some other games.</p>

<h3 id="objective-218">Objective 218</h3>

<p>After being soundly punished in GEV Escort, I pulled out Ogre: Objective
218 and got a taker in DMc. We played a pretty fast game, he left the
left side wide open and after a lot of distractions on the right, I sent
in a GEV and Infantry for CP occupation and the game.</p>

<p>Good game, plays fast.</p>

<h3 id="battle-for-sheffield">Battle for Sheffield</h3>

<p>This last game could easily be regarded as the main event for the day.
We didn't get started until a bit later with it, some time around 1 or 2
pm if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>The Battle for Sheffield scenarion is quite interesting and fun. As can
be seen from the photo below, there are a lot of Ogres involved in this
one: Mark II, III, and V defending, and a Mark II and 8(!) Mark Is
for the Pan Euro attacking (AS).</p>

<p>The defending Combine player (me) also receives 12 hex side blocks which
render movement across impassible for GEVs. I set them up to funnel
all the GEVs up the middle and hopefully into my howitzers.</p>

<p>Our game started a bit slow, with AS probing the outside defenses. It
did not work out well for him, it let me set up a defense which proved
very expensive for him.</p>

<p>Here's what the situation at the end of the game looked like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ogre/battle-for-sheffield-end.jpg" alt="Battle for Sheffield end of
game" /></p>

<p>While the attacker seems to have a lot of armor still on the board, the
Mark II and several of the Mark I Ogres are out of commission, while the
defending Mark V still has most of its armament and treads available.
The defender still has all the howitzers in play as well, which would be
increasingly tough for the defender. The infantry hasn't engaged yet
either.</p>

<p>Closeup of where the roads were cut:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ogre/battle-for-sheffield-roadcuts.jpg" alt="Battle for Sheffield road
cuts" /></p>

<p>I believe if I were the attacked it would probably be best to just
charge right up the middle to reduce as much defense as possible, then
scoot the GEVs around at the end and try to flank.</p>

<p>All in all a great day, and we're going to try to get another session
together sooner than later.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
