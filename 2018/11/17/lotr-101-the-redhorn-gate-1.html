LotR 101 - The Redhorn Gate (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 17 2018</time>
<p>First play of The Redhorn Gate, using the Deeds of Dwarves deck which
crushed Khazad-dum.</p>

  <li>Planning: play Erebor.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Erebor, and Arwen for 7, draw Mountain Troll,
net 1 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: no travel.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Mountain Goblin.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends, shadow Black Uruks for no effect and
no damage on Dain. Thorin attacks for 1 hit.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Dwarven Tomb.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Narvi's Belt on Thorin, exhaust to play
Kili (Spirit) and Fili, play Erebor Record Keeper for 7
dwarves on the table.</li>
  <li>Quest: Arwen, Ori, Kili, 1 Ereboer Record Keeper for 9, draw
Black Uruk, which discards Narvi's Belt. Bummer. Two more
Progress on quest card.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Black Uruks.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends Black Uruks, draw shadow Black Uruks
for no effect and no hits. Thorin defends Mountain Goblin, draw
shadow Rocky Crags, no Active Location so no effect and 1 hit
on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Longbeard Map Maker and Durin's Song.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Arwen, both Erebors, Ori for 9, draw Snow Warg

</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Second Breakfast and Cram.</li>
  <li>Planning: Attach Cram to Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Arwen and Ori for 5, draw Bitter Wind to discard 3
resources from each hero. That's probably the game right there, and
if not it added two rounds to the game while trying to rebuild
resources. Need to think about canceling Treachery maybe.
No net progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends Black Uruks, shadow Bitter Wind, no resources
left, but Dain takes no damage. Thorin defends Mountain Goblin, shadow
Warg Lair for no effect, takes another damage. Fili defends Snow Wargs,
shadow Avalanche for no effect, Fili dies.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Henamarth Riversong and Cram.</li>
  <li>Planning: Attach Cram to Dain.</li>
  <li>Quest: Play Henamarth, scry Warg Lair. This is going to put
a Mountain Warg into staging, which will result in 5 enemies
engaged this turn. Calling it here.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>A lot of enemies showed up early. Will be interesting to see if this
is random, or if this is a very enemy-heavy quest. Next game might
put me in location lock, who knows.</p>

<p><em>Bitter Wind</em> is just nasty and argues against "banking" resources.
Somehow, resources need to be spent as fast as possible until Bitter
Wind is out of play. In this game I was attempting to get a Forest
Snare ready for the Mountain Troll.</p>

<p>This quest may benefit from a deck having a lot of treachary and shadow
cancellation.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
