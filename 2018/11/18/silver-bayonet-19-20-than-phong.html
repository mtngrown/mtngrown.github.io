Silver Bayonet 19, 20; Than Phong
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 18 2018</time>
<p>Probably the last Silver Bayonet we'll play at Endgame, as they are
closing on 1 February 2019, and the mezzanine closes end of 2018.
Hence, we're trying to get as many plays in as possible over the next
month or so. Hopefully we'll get one more game of Ogre in as well.</p>

<p>On to the Ia Drang.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-2-plei-mei">Scenario 2 Plei Mei</h3>

<p>First up was a rematch of Lure and Ambush, opening salvo (first 7 turns)
of the operation, consisting of the NVA siege of the Special Forces camp
at Plei Mei. We played this a few weeks ago, where I lost by a few
points as the PAVN. On this rematch, I was determined to do much better.
And I did. The FWA player, my usual opponent AS, forgot that this is a 7
turn game, and did not charge his ARVN in to get the US forces on the
map. With no US forces on the map, Plei Mei was doomed and finally
occupied by the PAVN at the top of Turn 6. FWA conceded the game at that
point.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-7-than-phong">Scenario 7 Than Phong</h3>

<p>Second match was Scenario 7: Than Phong. This excerpts a small piece of
the campaign game to model the PAVN escape at the end of the campaign.
Tables turned here, the PAVN being no respecter of ZOCs slipped through
the lines and got onto the Chu Pong Massif. I actually conceded as the
FWA for a PAVN minor victory, but I think I conceded too soon. The PAVN
would have taken a couple more turns to escape, and I could have
possibly reduced another step or two via airstrikes. I'll know for next
time.</p>

<h3 id="nimmt">6 Nimmt!</h3>

<p>Another ghastly loss at 6 Nimmt!. This game continues to elude me. I
really have no idea how to play it well, and I usually lose, often quite
badly as was the case here: 35 to 63. Given I usually lose, I suspect
there is something quite fundamental which I am missing; I have some
fundamental misconception about how the game plays.</p>

<h3 id="star-realms-colony-wars">Star Realms Colony Wars</h3>

<p>Conversely, I won at Star Realms, another game I usually lose to this
opponent. This was a pretty close game, coming down to a final hand. AS
draw all Scouts, I drew enough to interact with two bases on the table
to deal 25 damage to his 10 Authority remaining. A sweet, sweet win
indeed.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
