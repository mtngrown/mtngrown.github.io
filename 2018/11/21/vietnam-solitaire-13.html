Vietnam Solitaire 13
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 21 2018</time>
<p>This is Game 13, and will push my h-index to 13 as well. Will be
playing original rules.</p>

<p>The last game I got beaten on Turn 2. This game, let's try to get a
little further along.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: Roll 2, 2, no additional Trail markers.</p>

<p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: B52 on Haiphong, roll 4 for success. B52 on
Hanoi, roll 4 for success. No Trail markers on the map.</p>

<p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: AirCav in Hue and Highlands, ARVN in
Hue. This is 11 PP, which lost me the game on Turn 2 my previous game.
Let's how it plays out this time.</p>

<p>D. <strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>: Pass, all VC in paddies.</p>

<p>E. <strong>Place NVA/VC Units</strong>: VC in Highlands-3-4, will be insurgency
there.</p>

<p>F. <strong>Insurgency Combat</strong>: Highlands-3-4 with 1 VC, 1 ARVN, and 1
AirCav. Jungle, VC takes out ARVN, then takes out AirCav. That might
be the game, need to get a point back…</p>

<p>G. <strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong>: Cu Chi, ARVN prevails. FWA gets a point
back for clearing out Cu Chi.</p>

<p>H. <strong>AirCav Redeployment</strong>: Deploy to Highlands 6.</p>

<p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>:</p>

<p>PP 13.</p>

<p>Roll 6 + 2, remove US unit from map. Dang. That sucks. Need to get some
ARVN down next turn.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: Roll 3, 3, Trail counter in Laos-3.</p>

<p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: B52 roll 5, no effect.</p>

<p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: 5 ARVN and 1 AC. That's all the ARVN
on the map.</p>

<p>D. <strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>: Pass, all VC are in Jungle.</p>

<p>E. <strong>Place NVA/VC Units</strong>: VC roll 6, no placement. NVA roll 2 for
Highlands-1-2.</p>

<p>F. <strong>Insurgency Combat</strong>: No insurgency combat.</p>

<p>G. <strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong>: Roll 3 for offensive in Cu Chi, no VC or NVA in
Cu Chi. I'm catching some slack here.</p>

<p>H. <strong>AirCav Redeployment</strong>: I'm good with Air Cav in Highlands.</p>

<p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>:</p>

<p>Get a PP back for control of Cu Chi, 8 PP total so no effect on the
political roll for next turn: roll 2, no B52 attacks.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: 6, 3, place 1 in Cambodia-6. I'm getting
some lucky breaks on Trail counters this game.</p>

<p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: GB in Cambodia-6, roll 6, roll 5, bummer.</p>

<p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: US in Highlands and Mekong.</p>

<p>D. <strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>: Napalm in Saigon-1-2, roll 2 ftw. Napalm
in Highlands-1-2, roll 2 and remove NVA.</p>

<p>E. <strong>Place NVA/VC Units</strong>: VC, roll 2, 6 to place in Highlands-6.
NVA in Highlands-5 and Mekong-3-4.</p>

<p>F. <strong>Insurgency Combat</strong>: Highlands-6, VC eliminated. Mekong-3-4, NVA
eliminated.</p>

<p>G. <strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong>: Roll 1, Hue, ARVNN prevails.</p>

<p>H. <strong>AirCav Redeployment</strong>: None.</p>

<p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>:</p>

<p>Three areas controlled, pretty good, -3 on the PP track, roll 1 play as
normal.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: 5, 6, add Trail to Cambodia-5.</p>

<p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: Attack Cambodia-5, roll 1, remove. Again
for Cambodia-6, roll 2, remove.</p>

<p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: US regular to Cu Chi-3-4.</p>

<p>D. <strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>: Napalm Highlands-5, roll 3 and remove NVA.
PP is at 11, hopefully will get some points back.</p>

<p>E. <strong>Place NVA/VC Units</strong>: VC to Mekong-3-4. NVA to Highlands-3-4.</p>

<p>F. <strong>Insurgency Combat</strong>: none.</p>

<p>H. <strong>AirCav Redeployment</strong>: none.</p>

<p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>: Hue, Cu Chu, and
Saigon controller by FWA, -3 PP for unmodified, roll 1 for no effect.
Pretty awesome. This game should go to a draw unless I get too greedy.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: Roll 5, 6 for Cambodia-5 and
Cambodia-6. Things could start getting hard now.</p>

<p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: Attack Cambodia-5, roll 1 remove
Trail marker. Again on Laos-3, roll 5, miss.</p>

<p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: 1 US regular in Highlands.</p>

<p>D. <strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>: Napalm in Highlands-1-2, roll 1 remove
VC.</p>

<p>E. <strong>Place NVA/VC Units</strong>: VC roll 6, thn 5 to place VC in Mekong-5.
NVA roll 2 for Highlands, roll 3 for Mekong.</p>

<p>F. <strong>Insurgency Combat</strong>: Mekong, US prevails.</p>

<p>G. <strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong>: roll 3, Cu Chi, no Chicom. Lucky.</p>

<p>H. <strong>AirCav Redeployment</strong>: none.</p>

<p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>:
Political Roll 4, no B52 or GB attacks. Game is about to
get hard.</p>

<p>Will be able to bring on second AC next turn.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: Roll 1, 4, will have a lot of
NVA on the board this turn.</p>

<p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: None allowed this turn.</p>

<p>H. <strong>AirCav Redeployment</strong>: none.</p>

<p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>: 2 Regions
under FWA control for 8 PP hence no DRM, roll 5, no
US or allies deploy next turn. No big deal as they are
already all on the map.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: roll 3, 5 for Cambodia-5,
need to take this out as it threatens Saigon.</p>

a marginal victory.</p>

<h2 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h2>

<p>I. <strong>Scoring, Victory Check and Events Roll</strong>:</p>

<p>Adjusted PP 10 for controlling Saigon and Highlands.

<h2 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h2>

<p>If I make it through this turn, I get a marginal victory
"Good Morning Vietnam."</p>

<p>A. <strong>Roll for Trail Counters</strong>: roll 4, 5, Saigon threatened
again.</p>

<p>B. <strong>Attack Trail areas</strong>: GB roll 2, remove from Cambodia-5
Saigon is safe again.</p>

<p>C. <strong>Raise/Move US/ARVN Forces</strong>: none.</p>

<p>D. <strong>US/ARVN Combat</strong>: none.</p>

<p>E. <strong>Place NVA/VC Units</strong>: VC into Saigon-2. NVA:
Two into Hue-3-4, ugly. Highlands-1. Cu Chi 1. Saigon 1.
Mekong 3.</p>

<p>F. <strong>Insurgency Combat</strong>: Hue FWA prevail lose 1 ARVN.
Mekong 3-4, FWA prevail, no losses.</p>

<p>G. <strong>NVA/VC Offensive</strong>: Roll 6! Dang! Hue, US loss,
Hue is under PAVN control, and that's the game. I have
11 PP right now, and down 5 already… let's roll it out…
Highlands under FWA control…Cu Chi under FWA control but
lost another ARVN. Lost another ARVN in Saigon…Saigon
has fallen…calling it here.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This was a draw on Turn 10, "Full Metal Jacket."</p>

<p>In the last game, I don't believe any of the US forces have scored hits on
either VC or NVA. Conversely, the NVA and VC have rolled really well.
That was a stupendous bummer. This game started the same way, but turned
around after a few turns and the FWA started cleaning up.</p>

<p>This would have been a marginal victory had there not been an NVA
general offensive on Turn 10. Hard to say how much further it could
have gone.</p>

<p>The goal for 2019 is to continue plays, but using the Special Edition
rules instead of the original rules. Most of my plays here to fore have
been using the original rules.</p>

<h3 id="aircav">AirCav</h3>

<p>AirCav is expensive to get on the map, and really sucks when it gets
taken out. What I'm did in this game is use for maintaining control
of areas, and not fighting it without a lot of ARVN and regular US
unit support. It's that next-to-last phase which is critical: Moving
the AirCav to an area can deny PP to the PAVN.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
