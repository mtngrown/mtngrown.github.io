The Company War (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 22 2018</time>
<p>For various reasons, I wanted to get my average play count back to 7
and my H-index to 13 before digging into a bunch of new games. Both of
those milestones achieved, Mayfair Game's <em>The Company War</em> is the first
new game on the table in many, many months. The game is based on CJ
Cherryh's Hugo award-winning "Downbelow Station," which I am currently
reading.</p>

<p>I'm setting up the two player, strategic game.</p>

<h3 id="turn-sequence">Turn Sequence</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>First Player movement</strong>:</li>
  <li><strong>Second Player movement</strong>:</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>:</li>
  <li><strong>Repair</strong>:</li>
  <li><strong>Placement of Garrisons</strong>:</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase new Garrisons</strong>:</li>
  <li><strong>Determine and record Victory Points</strong>:</li>
  <li><strong>Advance Turn Counter and play next turn</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>

<p>Separate out Dartships and Riders from Mazianni and Union counters,
all other ships go on the map: Union ships at Cyteen, Mazianni ships
spread between Pell, Pan Paris, and Gallileo stations. There is marked
asymmetry here, the Union ships outnumber Mazianni ships at least 2:1.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Mazianni has initiative, moves first.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First Player movement: roll 4 + 1, move 5 ships.</li>
  <li>Second Player movement: roll 5 + 1, move 6 ships.</li>
  <li>Combat: will occur at Mariner and Esperance. Combat at Mariner is
inconclusive, Mazianni ship flees back to Pell. Esperance: round 1 no
hits, round 2 no hits, Mazianni flees back to Ran Paris.</li>
  <li>Repair: none.</li>
  <li>Placement of Garrisons: Russell's, Paradise, Viking.</li>
  <li>Purchase new Garrisons: none.</li>
  <li>Determine and record Victory Points: Mazianni 7, Union: 0.</li>
  <li>Advance Turn Counter and play next turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>Interesting. Sort of an area control thing going on.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Mazianni moves first again.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>First Player movement</strong>: Roll 4 + 1…</li>
  <li><strong>Second Player movement</strong>: Union roll 4 + 1…</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: Mariner: Attrition, 2 losses each, that's
really bad for Mazianni. Remaining Mazianni ship flees back
to Pell. Paradise, Union prevails with carrier back to Ran Paris,
Garrison is destroyed with 3 Union ships at Paradise.</li>
  <li><strong>Repair</strong>: none.</li>
  <li><strong>Placement of Garrisons</strong>: all good.</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase new Garrisons</strong>: none.</li>
  <li><strong>Determine and record Victory Points</strong>:  Mazianni 20, Union 8.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance Turn Counter and play next turn</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Here's a photo of the top of Turn 3:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/company-war/company-war-g1-t3.jpg" alt="Company War top of Turn 3" /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>First Player movement</strong>: Union first move with 7 ships!</li>
  <li><strong>Second Player movement</strong>: Mazianni moves 3 ships, takes 2, will
fight to open jump points from Russell's.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: JP 29: damage to Union, JP 20, damage to Union. All
ships flee.</li>
  <li><strong>Repair</strong>: none</li>
  <li><strong>Placement of Garrisons</strong>: none</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase new Garrisons</strong>: Garrison to Ran Paris</li>
  <li><strong>Determine and record Victory Points</strong>: Mazziani 23, Union 11.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance Turn Counter and play next turn</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>First Player movement</strong>:  Union 5 total. Moves to surround Ran
Paris.</li>
  <li><strong>Second Player movement</strong>: 7 total. Chooses not to move.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: none.</li>
  <li><strong>Repair</strong>: none.</li>
  <li><strong>Placement of Garrisons</strong>: nothing new.</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase new Garrisons</strong>: Garrison at Pell.</li>
  <li><strong>Determine and record Victory Points</strong>: Mazianni 26, Union 11.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance Turn Counter and play next turn</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>First Player movement</strong>: Union move first with 3 ships, 3 CVs to
Viking.</li>
  <li><strong>Second Player movement</strong>: 3 ships. Abandon Garrison at Viking.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: None.</li>
  <li><strong>Repair</strong>: None.</li>
  <li><strong>Placement of Garrisons</strong>: None.</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase new Garrisons</strong>: None.</li>
  <li><strong>Determine and record Victory Points</strong>: Mazianni 28, Union 14.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance Turn Counter and play next turn</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<p>Going to be really hard for Union to catch up at this point.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>First Player movement</strong>: Union for 6. Cluster on Ran Paris.</li>
  <li><strong>Second Player movement</strong>: Mazianni for 3. Move from Ran Paris to
JP 31 for what should be an easy kill for 3 VPs.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: Mazianni prevails at JP 31 with no losses, Union loses a
CL.</li>
  <li><strong>Repair</strong>: none.</li>
  <li><strong>Placement of Garrisons</strong>: none.</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase new Garrisons</strong>: none.</li>
  <li><strong>Determine and record Victory Points</strong>: Mazianni 30, Union 14.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance Turn Counter and play next turn</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the situation at the end of Turn 6:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/company-war/g1-t6-end.jpg" alt="Company War end of Turn 6" /></p>

<p>It looks grim for the Mazianni, but they are so far ahead on VPs
that they simply need to hold out.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>First Player movement</strong>: Mazianni for 4. Try to retake Viking.</li>
  <li><strong>Second Player movement</strong>: Union for 6. Big throwdown at JP 31.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: Viking: Maziannia reoccupy. JP 31, Union drives off
Mazianni, casualties both sides.</li>
  <li><strong>Repair</strong>: none.</li>
  <li><strong>Placement of Garrisons</strong>: Viking.</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase new Garrisons</strong>: Garrison to Pell.</li>
  <li><strong>Determine and record Victory Points</strong>: Mazianni 35, Union 18.
I think these are a little bit off, Union should have a few more I
think, but not enough to tip the game at this point.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance Turn Counter and play next turn</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<p>Calling the game here in favor of the Mazianni.</p>

<h2 id="aar-and-review">AAR and Review</h2>

<p>The Mazianni got off to a roaring start, and the Union was unable to
catch up within the turn limit.</p>

<p>After 1 play, I'm definitely putting it back on the table. It's
definitely very swingy, dice matter a lot, and it's possible to get
completely tooled with bad rolls. However, it's still really interesting
to me to see what can be made of those sorts of situations. The
swingy-ness adds a lot of variation to game play, and will dictate
strategy contingent on how the initial die rolls turn out. Looking
forward to playing this again.</p>

<p>Blunders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fleeing counts for movement. This means ships which choose to flee
have to be moved on the next turn within the bounds of the player's
movement roll. This is going to hurt how I've played the Mazziani
faction for sure, but I can see that it will bring better balance into
the game. This is a case where the rules are all there, and correct, but
the paragraph format is difficult for me to parse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More? Probably, not seeing anything yet, will need to reread the
rules.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From an initial impression, the rules are a bit of a mess, not being
organized in a logical manner (to me). I would expect a single rule
book laying out the various 2, 3, and 4 player options, with strategic
and tactical rules following behind.</p>

<p>I'm not happy that Garrisons can be abandoned by the Mazziani player.
I suppose it could be thought of as having garrison rendered ineffective
via taken prisoner or whatever, rather than being killed. Will have to
watch for this situation in the books.</p>

<p>Overall, I like this game! I'm definitely putting it into rotation for
solo play, may try to introduce it to an opponent.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
