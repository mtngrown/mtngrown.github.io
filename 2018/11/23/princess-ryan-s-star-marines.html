Princess Ryan's Star Marines (first play)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 23 2018</time>
<p>Vintage Avalon Hill, definitely silly, but something fun to poke around
with on a holiday weekend.</p>

<p>I like these sorts of games from time to time. There is nothing
pretentious about them, there is no point to them other than having fun,
and that's not a bad thing.</p>

<p>Since I'm having trouble getting started this morning, I'm just going to
jump right into playing, and will worry about sorting out all the rules
later.</p>

<h2 id="round-1">Round 1</h2>

<p>It says to skirmish in Site 1 before proceeding, so let's do that.</p>

<p>Skirmishers for this initial round are Deadeye and Kitty. Guard has
skirmish value of 16, so both of these Marines need to use their
abilities to win the skirmish. Since Kitty is highest rank (5), she
wins the skirmish. This was a blunder, the Site skirmish is -3 Guards,
so I don't need to use Kitty's Skill.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Move: adjacent, draw 6 flip Site card for Site 31 Revolution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time: check draw 8 &gt; 5, pass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Garrison: Draw a Guard "Laser Guided Perimeter Defenses."
This Guard shows a reinforcement may be drawn, but the site disallows
it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skirmishers: Steel Dome (4) and Insurance Man (2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Weapons: Plasma Projector (5)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Combat: Marines win 11-10, Dispatch "Marked Man."</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="round-2">Round 2</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Move</strong>: 3F, draw 11, pass Site check.</li>
  <li><strong>Time</strong>: draw 6 &lt;= 9, fail, Time 14.</li>
  <li><strong>Garrison</strong>: Mind Meld.</li>
  <li><strong>Skirmishers</strong>: Insurance Man and Grandma.</li>
  <li><strong>Weapons</strong>: None.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: Grandma Stunned.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="round-3">Round 3</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Move</strong>: 4F, fail site check draw Site 29 Special Forces Camp.</li>
  <li><strong>Time</strong>: draw 12 &gt;= 2, pass.</li>
  <li><strong>Garrison</strong>: Security Robots and Laser Rifle Team, with +8 for total
of 38 Skirmish value. Bad.</li>
  <li><strong>Skirmishers</strong>: Dead Eye and Kitty.</li>
  <li><strong>Weapons</strong>: No weapons.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: Guard win, Deadeye is casualty draw Sick Bay. Guard check
for replacing site: draw 12 &gt;= 7. Further Casualty from icon, draw 13,
captured. Pursuit check: draw 10 to replace site 4 with Radar Tower.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, the way I read the rules, I can either stay here and fight, regroup
and stay here and fight, or flee to space above or below essentially
starting a new round.</p>

<h2 id="round-4">Round 4</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Move</strong>: Flee to Radar Tower.</li>
  <li><strong>Time</strong>: draw 9 &gt;= 1, pass.</li>
  <li><strong>Garrison</strong>: Doomsday Bomb (S), Mobile Armored Infantry (32),
Reptilian Scouts (6), with +4 for site for total 42. This is pretty
much automatically a loss, because there is also casualty and kill
markers on these cards.</li>
  <li><strong>Skirmishers</strong>: Steel Dome and Insurance Man.</li>
  <li><strong>Weapons</strong>: None, pointless.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: Guard win. Draw 12, Insurance Man goes to Morgue; draw 9
Steel Dome is KIA, goes to Morgue. Could have probably played the
Dispatch card for capture, didn't have enough Skirmish though, this is a
good reason to add weapons regardless of losing.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="regroup">Regroup</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Sick Bay: draw 7, Deadeye goes to Ready Room face up.</li>
  <li>All other Marines are killed or captured.</li>
  <li>Time now 11.</li>
  <li>Weapons: Shuffle and draw 2 each.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="round-5">Round 5</h2>

<p>We're in Site 4, and have to fight here after the regroup.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Move</strong>: stay and fight after regroup.</li>
  <li><strong>Time</strong>: 3 &gt;= 2, pass.</li>
  <li><strong>Garrison</strong>: Light Infantry (14) and Floating Gun Jeeps (22).
Bummer. Total is 40.</li>
  <li><strong>Skirmishers</strong>: The Transformer and Harvard.</li>
  <li><strong>Weapons</strong>: None.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: Loss. Transformer goes to Sick Bay.</li>
</ol>

<p>Still having trouble for what to do after Combat loss. The Guard
site management and Marine flee movement are not clear.</p>

<h2 id="round-6">Round 6</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Move</strong>: Stay and fight.</li>
  <li><strong>Time</strong>: none, not moving.</li>
  <li><strong>Garrison</strong>: Automated Listening Posts (4)</li>
  <li><strong>Skirmishers</strong>: Da Scribbler (2) cancels the reinforcement draw,
Harvard (2).</li>
  <li><strong>Weapons</strong>: Laser Rifle for 5.</li>
  <li><strong>Combat</strong>: This is a win for the Marines. Dispatch "Short Cut."</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>Might be stopping here. Going to log this as a play, but leaving it on
the table until tomorrow. If there is good morning light tomorrow
morning, I'll play a couple more rounds.</p>

<h2 id="aar--review">AAR &amp; Review</h2>

<p>First thing: I have a hard time reading the cards in low light. The font
is some sort quasi-futuristic styled "digital" type face, and the
letters are very difficult to read in my typical lighting conditions.
It doesn't help that the day I played this was very rainy and foggy.
This makes me sad, and detracts from the game play.</p>

<p>Open questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What happens when the Guard deck is exhausted?</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
