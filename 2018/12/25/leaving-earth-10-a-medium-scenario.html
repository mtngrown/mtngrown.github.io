<p>One of my unstated goals for the remainder of the year is to get a 10th
play of Leaving Earth. This is no more a desire to align the numbers on
my yearly Mastery Challenge, "10" is a 2-digit number. This also bumps
me to a dime on Leaving Earth plays. Probably not the greatest reason to
play a game, so here's another reason, probably also not that great.</p>

<p>In the interest of learning spreasheets in general and Google Sheets
in particular, these missions are planned out on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rq1U9KjcUj83PudKF464qCdtFmY2QmevukZ5DBBnkjQ/edit#gid=1175989269">this set of
Google
sheets</a>.
Not that I don't anything about spreadsheets, it's just been many years
since I've done anything interesting with them.</p>

<h2 id="missions">Missions</h2>

<ol>
  <li><code>7</code> Working Probe/Capsule on Mars</li>
  <li><code>6</code> Reveal Venus Location</li>
  <li><code>5</code> Reveal Mars Location</li>
  <li><code>4</code> Reveal Moon Location</li>
  <li><code>4</code> Man to Earth Orbit and Back</li>
  <li><code>2</code> Man to Space and Back</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="advancements">Advancements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Landing</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="through-1959"><code>1956</code> through <code>1959</code></h3>

<p>Purchase:</p>

  <li>Soyuz advancement</li>
  <li>Juno advancement</li>
  <li>5 Juno rockets</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="section"><code>1963</code></h3>

<p>Mars landing attempt can now proceed. I have all the gear I need to get
the craft to Mars: 2 Soyuz, an Atlas, and a Probe. The Soyuz and Atlas
are fully tested. Rendezvous has one more outcome which will be tested
before the probe separates for landing. Landing has not been tested at
all, but that can be done while the Mars craft is in flight.</p>

<h3 id="mars-landing"><code>1966</code> Mars landing</h3>

<p>Every went really smooth, all the necessary testing was completed while
this probe was in flight, picked up the reveal and the landing on the
same turn.</p>

<h3 id="finishes-wwith-venus-reveal"><code>1968</code> finishes wwith Venus Reveal</h3>

<p>Once I had the Advancements ready, the systematic testing let me get
stuff into orbit with little difficulty. For example, I sent the Mars
expedition off in 1963, and had plenty of time to test Rendezvous and
Landing. Once I got to Mars it was easy-peasy.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Using a spreadshet really helps this game, and not just for single
mission planning. The real key is running a calendar schedule to induce
synergies between all the missions. It should be possible to create such
a sheet for printing, to use in face-to-face games.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
