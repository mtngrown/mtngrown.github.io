Leaving Earth 10, a medium scenario
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 25 2018</time>
<p>One of my unstated goals for the remainder of the year is to get a 10th
play of Leaving Earth. This is no more a desire to align the numbers on
my yearly Mastery Challenge, "10" is a 2-digit number. This also bumps
me to a dime on Leaving Earth plays. Probably not the greatest reason to
play a game, so here's another reason, probably also not that great.</p>

<p>In the interest of learning spreasheets in general and Google Sheets
in particular, these missions are planned out on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rq1U9KjcUj83PudKF464qCdtFmY2QmevukZ5DBBnkjQ/edit#gid=1175989269">this set of
Google
sheets</a>.
Not that I don't anything about spreadsheets, it's just been many years
since I've done anything interesting with them.</p>

<h2 id="missions">Missions</h2>

</ul>

<h3 id="section"><code>1963</code></h3>

<p>Mars landing attempt can now proceed. I have all the gear I need to get
the craft to Mars: 2 Soyuz, an Atlas, and a Probe. The Soyuz and Atlas
are fully tested. Rendezvous has one more outcome which will be tested
before the probe separates for landing. Landing has not been tested at
all, but that can be done while the Mars craft is in flight.</p>

<h3 id="mars-landing"><code>1966</code> Mars landing</h3>

<p>Every went really smooth, all the necessary testing was completed while
this probe was in flight, picked up the reveal and the landing on the
same turn.</p>

<h3 id="finishes-wwith-venus-reveal"><code>1968</code> finishes wwith Venus Reveal</h3>

<p>Once I had the Advancements ready, the systematic testing let me get
stuff into orbit with little difficulty. For example, I sent the Mars
expedition off in 1963, and had plenty of time to test Rendezvous and
Landing. Once I got to Mars it was easy-peasy.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Using a spreadshet really helps this game, and not just for single
mission planning. The real key is running a calendar schedule to induce
synergies between all the missions. It should be possible to create such
a sheet for printing, to use in face-to-face games.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
