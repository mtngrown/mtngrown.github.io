Leaving Earth 11 - a hard scenario
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 30 2018</time>
<p>After last week's successful game, I'm in the mood to set up a hard
scenario. I'll probably be able to complete it, the curious thing is how
fast. Typically, the hard scenarios require testing at least 8 or 9
advancements, which really puts a lot of time pressure on the game.</p>

<p>I may try and figure out how to separate planning into Boost
Phase which provisions Earth Orbit, and Mission Phase, which launches
the missions from Earth Orbit. I haven't been able to do this
successfully in the past. It will be required to succeed at Outer
Planets missions.</p>

<p>This game will be recorded the same way the last game was recorded, on
a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RayqWN3-Fu340LJauFt5NzrVXd4d2JECS5ZCgJX1490/edit#gid=1175989269">Google Sheet tracking mission
requirements</a>
and yearly activity.
Highlights will be noted below.</p>

<h2 id="missions">Missions</h2>

<p>Eight missions total:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>19</code> Mercury Sample Return: Mercury sample on Earth</li>
  <li><code>15</code> Lunar Station: Man on Moon at start of year</li>
  <li><code>13</code> Mercury Lander: Working Probe/Capsule on Mercury</li>
  <li><code>11</code> Venus Lander: Working Probe/Capsule on Venus</li>
  <li><code>7</code> Mercury Survery: Reveal Mercury location</li>
  <li><code>5</code> Mars Survey: Reveal Mars location</li>
  <li><code>2</code> Artificial Satellite: Working Probe/Capsule in Earth orbit</li>
  <li><code>1</code> Sounding Rocket: Working Probe/capsule in space</li>
</ol>

<p>I need 37 of 73 total points to "win" a solo game.</p>

<h3 id="a-quick-refresher-on-turn-sequence">A quick refresher on Turn Sequence</h3>

<p>Since I play this game solo most of the time, I don't pay a lot of
attention to the turn sequence. At some point I hope to start playing
with 1 or more opponents, whence the turn sequence will become
critically important. The sequence goes like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resolve Start of Year effects.</li>
  <li>Receive $25.</li>
  <li>Conduct as many operations as desired.</li>
  <li>Resolve End of Year effects:
  * Remove 1 Time Token
  * Repair all damaged components on Earth
  * Check Life Support. Note monies left over here can only
 be used for Life Support research.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Time Tokens are always the part which I don't recall correctly.</p>

<h3 id="mercury-missions">Mercury missions</h3>

<p>To get a probe onto Mercury, I need a Juno in orbit. It's a 2 mass
maneuver of 2 difficulty.  To get a sample off of Mercury, I need to
land a Juno, then have the Juno boost the sample back to Mercury orbit.
What I need to get to Mercury Orbit is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 Juno</li>
  <li>1 Probe</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is total mass 4. I think I'm going to need a Soyuz to get it there
from Inner Planets if I combine missions.</p>

<p>Doing some initial numbers, it looks like combining the missions is too
difficult and risky. The sample mission can be run pretty cheap provided
stuff is in Earth Orbit.</p>

<h2 id="first-launch"><code>1958</code> First launch</h2>

<p>This scores Sounding Rocket and Probe in Orbit for 3 points.</p>

<h2 id="mercury-sample-return-mission-debarks"><code>1962</code> Mercury Sample Return mission debarks</h2>

<p>The Mercury Sample Return mission has debarked Earth Orbit. There is one
more Outcome left on Ion Thrusters Advancement. It would be good to
clear this before the thruster has to fire again at Inner Planets
Transfer.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to have another Ion mission ready for sample
return which could debark if there is an IPT Ion failure.</p>

<p>A better alternative is probably have the lander mission ready to fire,
there is a lot less time pressure on that one, it can fail no problem.</p>

<h2 id="sequencing-testing"><code>1963</code> Sequencing testing</h2>

<p>This is a critical year to get the Ion outcomes resolved. Sequencing
will be important.</p>

<p>Here is what needs to happen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Launch repaired Ion into Earth Orbit, rendezvous with Juno and Probe,
and debark Mercury Landing mission. Ion firing outcome is success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchase Atlas advancement, 3 Atlas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Debark for Venus Landing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchase Atlas Advancements and 3 Atlas Rockets.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="juno-testing"><code>1964</code> Juno testing</h2>

<p>This needs to happen at some point, and this is a good point. I have a
lot of Junos, so I don't need to buy off every success. The result is
I bought off the first success, which was followed by a minor failure,
then success, not bad.</p>

<p>Purchased Landing Advancement.</p>

<h2 id="landing-testing"><code>1965</code> Landing testing</h2>

<p>I have a lot of Junos for this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>4 Juno, Major Failure.</li>
  <li>4 Juno, Success.</li>
  <li>Atlas, Juno: Atlas Success purchased, Major Failure on Landing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not bad, I can deal with it.</p>

<h2 id="surveying"><code>1967</code> Surveying</h2>

<p>I do not want to be caught without a working Surveying Advancement,
so let's get that one knocked out right now. The idea is to boost
an Atlas, Probe and a couple of Junos. The Atlas will be needed later
for the manned moon mission. The two Junos can get the Probe to the
Moon and survey it. If it's a failure I can buy it off, it not, having
only a single outcome means success will leave me with $$$ for more
rockets.</p>

<p>This also gets spacecraft to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mercury Flyby,</li>
  <li>Venus Orbit.</li>
</ul>

<p>At Venus Orbit, another Survey for Venus, then the Ion can cycle back
to pick up the Mars Reveal Probe.</p>

<h2 id="life-support"><code>1968</code> Life Support</h2>

<p>Purchased a 3 Eagle capsules, these get boosted in a couple of
turns.</p>

<h2 id="complex-turn"><code>1969</code> Complex turn</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Purchase 2 Soyuz, 3 Supplies, 1 Probe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch 2 Soyuz, 3 Eagle, 3 Supplies, 1 Probe to Earth Orbit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mercury Sample return lands, samples, launches back to
Mercury Orbit, then gets placed on IPT with 3 Time Tokens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mars Ion rendezvous in Earth Orbit with Probe, gets placed
on Mars Orbit with 3 Time Tokens.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now Life Support testing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Success.</li>
  <li>Success.</li>
  <li>Major Failure purchased for $5.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remove 1 Time Token from Mercury Sample, Mercury Orbit,
and Mars Reveal.</p>

<h2 id="another-complex-turn"><code>1970</code> Another complex turn</h2>

<p>I need to clear Life Support, and it's going to cost me.
I need to save $15 to be sure to clear it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mercury Orbit, survey to reveal then land probe. Nothing interesting
revealed. Ion Thruster back to IPT with 2 TT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchase 1 Soyuz and 1 Atlas.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Life support testing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Success.</li>
  <li>Success.</li>
</ol>

<p>And only $2 left over.</p>

<p>Remove TT.</p>

<h2 id="a-lull"><code>1971</code> A lull</h2>

<p>Everything is in transit.</p>

<h2 id="mars-reveal-seasonal-growths"><code>1972</code> Mars reveal "seasonal growths"</h2>

<p>Mars reveal for 5.</p>

<h2 id="coast"><code>1973</code> Coast</h2>

<p>Nothing to do.</p>

<h2 id="mercury-sample-lands"><code>1974</code> Mercury Sample lands</h2>

<p>Add 19 to score for 54.</p>

<h2 id="man-to-moon"><code>1975</code> Man to Moon</h2>

<p>Purchase Eagle and Buzz Aldrin.</p>

<p>Suborbital is no effect.</p>

<h2 id="man-on-moon-at-start-of-year"><code>1976</code> Man on Moon at Start of Year</h2>

<p>Score 15 points for 73 total and that's a perfect game.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I got lucky early on with no Soyuz Failures, and easy Rendezvouz
testing. This let me use the Soyuz/Ion combo very effectively.</p>

<p>Using a spreadsheet is massively helpful. I can't imagine trying to
manage this game without it.</p>

<h2 id="components-without-advancements">Components without advancements</h2>

<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/article/32392188#32392188">From a discussion about components and advancements</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leaving Earth » Forums » Rules
Re: Trading components without Advancement
Robert is correct:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can't buy a Saturn rocket without the Saturn advancement.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But you can receive a Saturn rocket from another player without having
that advancement.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you fire a rocket that you don't have the advancement for, you
immediately gain that advancement with the full complement of outcomes
on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not know this. There is follow on discussion on which components
can receive advancements, and which do not. For example, (apparently)
receiving an Aldrin component will not gain the Life Support
advancement.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
