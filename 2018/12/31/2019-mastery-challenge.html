<p>Once again, the yearly Mastery Challenge. Last year was heavily
career-focused, so the mastery goals were limited to acheiving
H-index 13. This 2019 will be similar, the goal to acheive H-index 14.
As in 2018, I'm sure to play a few other game to stay well positioned
for H-index 15 in 2020. This is good because it keeps me from getting
too bored with any particular game.</p>

<p>Here are the challenges from 2016, 2017, and 2018:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/2017/12/31/2018-mastery-challenge.html">2018 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2016/12/31/2017-mastery-challenge.html">2017 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2015/12/31/2016-challenge.html">2016 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to career commitments, the only goal for 2019 is getting H-index to
14. This should not be difficult.</p>

<p><strong>2019-12-29</strong>: Current average plays for count of owned games: <code>779 / 111 = 7.01</code>.</p>

<h2 id="december-15-2019">December 15, 2019</h2>

<p>Almost surely not going to get to H-index 14, just don't have the
interest and energy combination to revisit any of the candidate games.
Maybe next year.</p>

<h2 id="october-20-2019">October 20, 2019</h2>

<p>Ironically, since writing at the end of August, if anything I've slowed
down playing, with one game of LotR card between then and today's Khe
Sanh game. On the other hand, the plants are mostly ready for winter,
with just a few more to repot and take cutting from. And the apartment
is in pretty clean shape.</p>

<h2 id="august-31-2019">August 31, 2019</h2>

<p>I'm intending on picking up the pace of game playing through the rest of
the year. Having people over once a month or so since June has motivated
me to really start deep cleaning the apartment. It's a sad task in some
sense, but the important thing is I'm putting in the effort, and it's
showing. The apartment is markedly cleaner and more comfortable, on
average, than it's been in many, many years. Through the remaining 4
months of the year, I'd like to get some OCS on the table, Ukraine '43,
and perhaps one of the campaigns in Silver Bayonet. That's actually
quite a lot game play, but it seems doable. I'm going to be running out
of daylight in the evening very soon, which will be a huge bummer, but
so it goes.</p>

<h3 id="h-index">H-index</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>116/101</code> <strong>Lord of the Rings LCG</strong> will almost surely remain my
most-played game in 2019. I don't have any more than a vague notion
of trying to finish the Dwarrowdelf cycle. There are a couple of pretty
hard quests, could take me a big chunk of the year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>63/63</code> <strong>Hive</strong> No plans to play Hive this year. Too engrossing and
I cannot bear to play it badly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>44/39</code> <strong>Ogre</strong> with the G3 and S3 maps coming out, Ogre will
definitely get some play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>31/30</code> <strong>Zombie Dice</strong> May catch a few games here and there, I
usually pack it along when I go to other places to play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>PanzerBlitz</strong> Nothing planned for this year, might
drag it out on a whim. Stranger things have happened.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>24/23</code> <strong>Star Realms</strong> With the FLGS closing down, I no longer have
a regular opponent for Star Realms. It's small enough to travel though,
so perhaps I'll get a play or two in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20/15</code> <strong>Race for the Galaxy</strong> is always good for a few random plays
here and there. If I end up getting sick in bed (doesn't happen often),
this would something I'd play online during that time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20/20</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong> Another casualty of losing the local
game store venue. I don't see myself setting it up for solo, but who
knows what 2019 will bring?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>19/18</code> <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> Had a good run with Fire in the Lake
in 2018, but again, it's that venue problem. We'll see what happens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>17/17</code> <strong>6 Nimmt!</strong> Another game I'll just tote along in case of a
group which wants to play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Cathedral</strong> I've found out the game is solved, which
reduces my interest in purchasing it. If I find a free copy I may
take it and see if I can't work out the solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/13</code> <strong>Ogre: Objective 218</strong> Will probably get a solo play or two
in this year. This is a good game to play when doing chores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/13</code> <strong>Vietnam Solitaire</strong> Time to start using the Special
Edition Rules. Most of the time I play using standard rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Battle for Moscow</strong> I still haven't really cracked this
game in the same way I cracked Target Leningrad. Would be worth playing
a few times to really see how to win it as the Germans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/10</code> <strong>Hapsburg Eclipse</strong> Good chance this will get back into
rotation this year. I think I've playing it wrong for a long time,
and I want to try out some new strategies. This is another game which
fits well in between chores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Objective Kiev</strong> I've cracked the German side, now to
figure out how to win as the Soviets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Pandemic</strong> My usual partner for this game is no longer
a gaming opponent or partner. If I play it this year, it will be
with the In The Lab expansion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Soviet Dawn</strong> Time to revisit for a few plays.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>StarForce</strong> Would like to play the solitaire situation
several more times, at different locations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Target Leningrad</strong> probably won't see a play in 2019, would
prefer to bring The Arduous Beginning into rotation, which only has
three plays at the moment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>Leaving Earth</strong> Will almost surely get played. I
really like the game, I can set it up and leave it for a period
of time, and it's easy to document play via spreadsheet. Also, I have
not yet played the Stations Expansion, which seems like an obvious
thing to do this year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Flash Point</strong> I almost always play this solo, it's
something good for chores days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>9/8</code> <strong>OCS</strong> Managed to play through the learning scenario in Burma.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong> Probably won't play this year as it's pretty
involved and there are other things I want to do instead. I do have an
interest in developing smaller scenarios for the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>6/2</code> <strong>Android:Netrunner</strong> is a new entry this year. I have a
dedicated opponent for the game, so I suspect I'll see a lot more
plays of it over the next year as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>1/1</code> <strong>COIN</strong> Would like to get a play of Cuba Libre in this
year.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wargame-specific-h-index">Wargame-specific H-index</h3>

<p>My wargame-specific H-index started 2019 at 10.  Wargames are so much
more time consuming that this index will increase much, much more slowly
than the overall H-index. And that's fine. I expect Ottoman Sunset,
Phantom Leader Deluxe and The Arduous Beginning to climb in 2019.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
