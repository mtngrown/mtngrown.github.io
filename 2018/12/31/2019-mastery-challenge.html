2019 Mastery Challenge
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 31 2018</time>
<p>Once again, the yearly Mastery Challenge. Last year was heavily
career-focused, so the mastery goals were limited to acheiving
H-index 13. This 2019 will be similar, the goal to acheive H-index 14.
As in 2018, I'm sure to play a few other game to stay well positioned
for H-index 15 in 2020. This is good because it keeps me from getting
too bored with any particular game.</p>

<p>Here are the challenges from 2016, 2017, and 2018:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/2017/12/31/2018-mastery-challenge.html">2018 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2016/12/31/2017-mastery-challenge.html">2017 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2015/12/31/2016-challenge.html">2016 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to career commitments, the only goal for 2019 is getting H-index to
14. This should not be difficult.</p>

<p><strong>2019-04-14</strong>: Current average plays for count of owned games: <code>728 / 104 = 7.00</code>.</p>

<h3 id="h-index">H-index</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>105/101</code> <strong>Lord of the Rings LCG</strong> will almost surely remain my
most-played game in 2019. I don't have any more than a vague notion
of trying to finish the Dwarrowdelf cycle. There are a couple of pretty
hard quests, could take me a big chunk of the year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>63/63</code> <strong>Hive</strong> No plans to play Hive this year. Too engrossing and
I cannot bear to play it badly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>39/39</code> <strong>Ogre</strong> with the G3 and S3 maps coming out, Ogre will
definitely get some play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>30/30</code> <strong>Zombie Dice</strong> May catch a few games here and there, I
usually pack it along when I go to other places to play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>PanzerBlitz</strong> Nothing planned for this year, might
drag it out on a whim. Stranger things have happened.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>23/23</code> <strong>Star Realms</strong> With the FLGS closing down, I no longer have
a regular opponent for Star Realms. It's small enough to travel though,
so perhaps I'll get a play or two in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20/20</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong> Another casualty of losing the local
game store venue. I don't see myself setting it up for solo, but who
knows what 2019 will bring?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>18/18</code> <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> Had a good run with Fire in the Lake
in 2018, but again, it's that venue problem. We'll see what happens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>17/17</code> <strong>6 Nimmt!</strong> Another game I'll just tote along in case of a
group which wants to play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Cathedral</strong> I've found out the game is solved, which
reduces my interest in purchasing it. If I find a free copy I may
take it and see if I can't work out the solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Race for the Galaxy</strong> is always good for a few random plays
here and there. If I end up getting sick in bed (doesn't happen often),
this would something I'd play online during that time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/13</code> <strong>Ogre: Objective 218</strong> Will probably get a solo play or two
in this year. This is a good game to play when doing chores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/13</code> <strong>Vietnam Solitaire</strong> Time to start using the Special
Edition Rules. Most of the time I play using standard rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Battle for Moscow</strong> I still haven't really cracked this
game in the same way I cracked Target Leningrad. Would be worth playing
a few times to really see how to win it as the Germans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/10</code> <strong>Hapsburg Eclipse</strong> Good chance this will get back into
rotation this year. I think I've playing it wrong for a long time,
and I want to try out some new strategies. This is another game which
fits well in between chores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Objective Kiev</strong> I've cracked the German side, now to
figure out how to win as the Soviets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Pandemic</strong> My usual partner for this game is no longer
a gaming opponent or partner. If I play it this year, it will be
with the In The Lab expansion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Soviet Dawn</strong> Time to revisit for a few plays.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>StarForce</strong> Would like to play the solitaire situation
several more times, at different locations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Target Leningrad</strong> probably won't see a play in 2019, would
prefer to bring The Arduous Beginning into rotation, which only has
three plays at the moment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>Leaving Earth</strong> Will almost surely get played. I
really like the game, I can set it up and leave it for a period
of time, and it's easy to document play via spreadsheet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Flash Point</strong> I almost always play this solo, it's
something good for chores days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>8/8</code> <strong>OCS</strong> May set up Burma for long running play.
Haven't decided yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong> Probably won't play this year as it's pretty
involved and there are other things I want to do instead. I do have an
interest in developing smaller scenarios for the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>1/1</code> <strong>COIN</strong> Would like to get a play of Cuba Libre in this
year.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wargame-specific-h-index">Wargame-specific H-index</h3>

<p>My wargame-specific H-index started 2019 at 10.  Wargames are so much
more time consuming that this index will increase much, much more slowly
than the overall H-index. And that's fine. I expect Ottoman Sunset,
Phantom Leader Deluxe and The Arduous Beginning to climb in 2019.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
