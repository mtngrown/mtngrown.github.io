LotR 102 - The Redhorn Gate (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 20 2019</time>
<p>Back with Deeds of Dwarves (or some variant thereof) to make another
attempt to get Arwen to Rivendell to visit Elrond. I did not do well
against this quest the first time I played, blown out in Round 5. Let's
see how well I can do here.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Durin's Song</li>
  <li>Cram</li>
  <li>Miner of the Iron Hills</li>
  <li>King under the Mountain</li>
  <li>Ancestral Knowledge</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial encounter is Black Uruks, nasty.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: Cram to Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori and Arwen, draw Rocky Crags net +4 Threat for 35.</li>
  <li>Travel: Rocky Crags, deal 2 hits to Ori.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Black Uruks.</li>
  <li>Combat: Thorin defends, draw Mountain Wargs for +2 attack,
Thorin takes 4 hits. Dang. Thorin readies with Cram, Dain and
Thorin kill Black Uruks.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Narvi's Belt.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Narvis on Thorin. Play Erebor and return Cram to
hand, then play on Dain.</li>
  <li>Quest: Erebor, Arwen, Ori for 7, draw Snow Wargs. 1 Progress on
Rocky Crags.</li>
  <li>Travel: At Rocky Crags.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Snow Wargs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends, draw shadow Black Uruks for no effect,
Dain takes no hits. Play Durin's Song on Thorin, who swings for 5
to take out Snow Wargs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Forest Snare.</li>
  <li>Planning: Miner of the Iron Hills, need to get the
swarm going.</li>
  <li>Quest: Miner, Erebor, Ori, and Arwen for 8, draw Mountain
Goblin, net 4 P, clear Rocky Crags.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Mountain Goblin.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends, draw shadow Warg Lair for no effect,
Dain takes no hits. Dain discards Cram, readies, Thorin and
Dain take out Mountain Goblin.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Second Breakfast, Kili. Excellent.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Second Breakfast and return Cram to hand
thence Dain. Exhaust Narvis to play Kili and Fili.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Arwen, Erebor, Fili, and Kili for 11, draw Mountain
Troll. Ghastly. This is going to be tough. Will have to chump
Miner. This clears the first stage.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Mountain Troll.</li>
  <li>Combat: Miner of the Iron Hills, draw shadow Knees of the Mountain
for no effect, Miner is still dead. No point in attacking, need 12
hits to kill. Snare next round.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Dwarven Tomb, Erebor Record Keeper.</li>
  <li>Planning: Forest Snare on Mountain Troll. Screw that guy.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Arwen, Erebor, Fili for 9, draw Turbulent Waters.
Net 3 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: Turbulent Waters.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<p>Doing better than my first game now.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Henamarth and Kili.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Henamarth Riversong, King under the Mountain on Dain,
Erebor Record Keeper. Henamarth scries Mountain Warg.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, Arwen, Erebor, Fili, Erebor RC for 15, draw
Mountain Warg, net 10 P to clear Turbulent Waters and Stage 2.</li>
  <li>Travel: Caradhras.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Mountain Warg.</li>
  <li>Combat: Fili defends, draw shadow Fell Voices with no effect, so
Mountain Warg kills Fili and goes back to Staging area.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Longbear Orc Slayer, Longbeard Mapmaker.</li>
  <li>Planning: King under the Mountain, draw Narvi's Belt and
Longbeard Orc Slayer, discard Narvis. Henamarth scries Fallen
Stones, lucky, no progress so far. Play Longbeard OS, will need some
attack strength soon.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, Arwen, Erebor HS, and Erebor RC for 8, draw Fallen
Stones for no effect, super lucky! Net 6 P, exhaust Dain to play
Ancestral Knowledge which clears Caradhras.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Mountain Warg.</li>
  <li>Combat: Fili defends, draw shadow Fallen
Stones for no effect as there is no Progess yet. Mountain
Warg stays engaged, discard Cram to ready Dain, Thorin and
Longbeard take out Mountain Warg.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<p>Need to get a Gandalf or something to reduce the threat, starting to get
a bit nervous.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Miner of the Iron Hills, Gloin.</li>
  <li>Planning: King under the Mountain draw Unexpected Courage
and Untroubled by Darkness (discard). Henamarth scries Black Uruks.
Play Kili and Fili. Turns out Longbeard OS gets discarded due to
Will of 0 from quest card, and Miner of Iron Hills with 0 Will
is no longer useful. Play Longbeard MM then.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Arwen, Erebor HS, Fili, Longbeard MM for 11, draw
Black Uruks for net 9.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Black Uruks.</li>
  <li>Combat: Kili defends, draw shadow Mountain Goblin for +1,
Kili is dead. Play Erebor RK to ready Ori, with Thorin kill
Mountain Warg.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Erebor RK, Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Mountain Goblin. King under the Mountain to
draw Erebor HS and Dwarven Tomb (discard). Play Gloin. Unexpected
Courage on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Arwen, Erebor HS, Erebor Rk, Fili, Gloin
for 15, draw Mountain Goblin for net 14. Total 23 progress
on the quest. Need some VPs.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Mountain Goblin.</li>
  <li>Combat: Longbeard MM defends, draw shadow Bitter Wind,
discard 2 resources from each hero. No big deal. Longbeard
MM takes a hit. Thorin readies with Unexpected Courage, Ori
and Thorin take down the goblin.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<p>Really needing a Gandalf and some VPs.</p>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Gloin, Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: King under the Mountain draw Durin's Song
and Forest Snare (discard). Will try to fish out Forest
Snare with Erebor HS in a later turn. Scry Mountain Warg.</li>
  <li>Quest: Arwen, draw Mountain Warg for even odds.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Mountain Warg.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gloin defends, draw shadow Rocky Crags for
no effect as there is no active Location. Gloin is kaput.
Erebor HS, Fili, and Longbeard MM for the kill. Thanks, Dain!</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 44.</li>
</ol>

<p>Jeebus. Probably get 3 Gandalfs in a row.</p>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Bifur, Longbeard MM.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Snow Wargs. King under the Mountain draw Narvis
Belt and Untroubled by Darkness (discard). I have a hunch I'm going
to need Forest Snare more than Untroubled by Darkness, so I'll deal
with the extra Narvis in the hand. Play Dwalin, Gloin, and Bifur,
draw Sneak Attack and Bifur. Dang.</li>
  <li>Quest: Arwen, Fili. Net 1 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Snow Wargs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends, draw shadow Turbulent Waters for no effect.
Gloin, Bifur, Longbeard MM attack and kill.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 45.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-12">Round 12</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Gandalf, Dori.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Bitter Wind. Time to spend some money. Play Erebor HS
to get Forest Snare back. Play Gandalf, Threat 40. Use Narvi to get
another Longbeard MM in play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Quest all but Dain for net 28, draw Bitter Wind. 52
Progess on quest. Where is a VP?</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-13">Round 13</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Gandalf, Henamarth Riversong.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Snow Warg. Crap.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin for net +1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Snow Warg.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends, draw shadow Snowstorm which reduces will
to 0, which would discard Dain, which would make it undefended,
which would be pretty much an immediate loss from a stupid enemy.
Just stupid. So play Durin's Song to get another +2 Will, and
take no further hits. I hope there are no more Snow Wargs.
Plenty of mojo to take out the Snow Warg.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-14">Round 14</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Dori, Forest Snare.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Fanhuidhol. Finally. I'll get the game
next turn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin for net +1 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: Fanhuidhol.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-15">Round 15</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Gandalf, Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Freezing Cold. NBD.</li>
  <li>Quest: All in but Dain for net 28, draw Freezing Cold. Net 28
put 7 on Fanhuidhol for 21 on Stage 3 resulting in 74 on the quest card.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's the game. Looked like a rocky start, but I just sucked up the
damage and got rolling.</p>

<p>I think I could probably replace one of the Dwarven Tombs with an
Ancestral Knowledge and get a better deck, at least for this quest.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
