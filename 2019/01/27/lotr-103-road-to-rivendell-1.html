LotR 103 - Road to Rivendell (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 27 2019</time>
<p>After a surpising fast win at The Redhorn Gate, I find myself at the
start of the second quest in the Dwarrowdelf series, <em>Road to
Rivendell</em>.</p>

<p>I'll be using my Deeds of Dwarves deck, which has become quite reliable.
It just needs a couple of turns to get going.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Miner of the Iron Hills</li>
  <li>Miner of the Iron Hills</li>
  <li>Narvi's Belt</li>
  <li>Kili</li>
  <li>Narvi's Belt</li>
  <li>Gloin</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial encounter: Mountain Warg.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Longbeard MM.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Arwen, draw Black Uruks, which sucks as the Threat
increase is going to bring them into engagemnt. Threat 33.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Mountain Warg and Black Uruks.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends Wargs, draw Undisturbed Bones, which would
discard the defending ally, which would suck if the attack would have to
be made undefended. Dain takes hit. Thorin defends Uruks, draw shadow
Wild Bear for no effect, Thorin takes 2 hits.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hrm. Not looking so good.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Erebor RK.</li>
  <li>Planning: Longbeard MM and Narvi's Belt on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Arwen, draw Pathless Country.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Longbeard defends Uruks, draw shadow Plundered Armory
for no effect, Longbeard takes 2 hits. Dain defends Wargs, draw shadow
Turbulent Waters for no effect, Warg back to staging. Thorin and Ori
kill Black Uruks.</li>

  <li>Planning: Kili and Fili, Erebor RK.</li>
  <li>Quest: Arwen, Ori and Kili for 7, draw Goblin Spearman.</li>
  <li>Travel: Pathless Country.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Spearman</li>
  <li>Combat: Fili defends Mountain Warg, draw shadow Followed By
Night which returns Warg to staging area, i.e., no op. This thing
is getting annoying, it's attritting me. Longbeard MM defends
Goblin Spearman, and dies, shadow is Black Uruks with no effect
unless undefended. Thorin and Dain kill Goblin Spearman.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>

  <li>Planning: Play Dwalin, Gloin.</li>

Country.</li>

added to the staging area. Dwalin takes two hits. Thorin, Kili,
and Gloin kill Mountain Warg. Finally.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Untroubled by Darkness and Henamarth
Riversong.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Henamarth. Scry Barren Hills. Play Unexpected Courage
on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Arwen, Thorin, Ori, Kili, Dwalin, and Erebor RK. Draw
Barren Hills for net 11 and 9 Progress on quest, Pathless Country
is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: Barren Hills.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Spearman.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gloin defends, draw shadow Goblin Spearman which goes
to staging area lol. Gloin takes 1 hit. Thorin readies and kills
Goblin Spearman.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Dwarven Tomb and Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Orc Ambush, which has a surge. Not going to quest
for much this turn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Arwen, Ori, Erebor for 7, draw Orc Ambush surge Wild Bear,
which is an Ambush card, but Barren Hills stops that. Net 7 Progress
which clears Barren Hills. Since this is after the reveal, the guard
against Ambush must surely holdâ€¦checking rules, seems to be ok.</li>

draw Ruined Road, net 15 which clears Stage 1. Put Goblin
Gate in as active location.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wild Bear already engaged.</li>
  <li>Combat: Kili defends, draw shadow Knees of the Mountain
for no effect but Kili is dead for now. Thorin and Erebor HS
kill Wild Bear.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Cram, Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Cram on Ori. Play Kili and Fili, Miner of
the Iron Hills. Scry Goblin Spearman</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, Arwen, Dwalin, Gloin, Fili, Kili,
Miner of the Iron Hills for 19, draw Goblin Spearman which
ambushes and attacks. Erebor HS defends, draw shadow Warg
Lair for no effect, EHS takes a hit. Net 16 Progress which
clears Goblin Gate and stage 2. Stage adds Orc Raiders, which
forces a discard of Cram and Narvi's Belt. No big deal. Just
means will have to go an extra turn. I have enough quest
power to stomp this next turn.</li>
  <li>Travel: Ruined Road, ready Ori. Nice.</li>
  <li>Encounter: all engaged.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends Goblin Spearman, draw shadow Chieftain
of the Pit, which forces another attack! Crap! Dain takes no hits.

  <li>Planning: Play Bifur, draw Dori and Dori. Play Narvi's Belt
and Dori and Miner of the Iron Hills. Scry Goblin Taskmaster.</li>
  <li>Quest: All but Dain for 26, draw Goblin Taskmaster, which
engages, but net 21 wins the game.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I found this to be a really easy quest with the dwarf swarm, once
I got it going. It took a few rounds to get it going, and I thought
I was in real trouble coming out of round 3. Curious how this quest
rates for difficulty.</p>

<p>This would be a good quest to try with a Hobbit deck I think. Not sure
I can put one together yet.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
