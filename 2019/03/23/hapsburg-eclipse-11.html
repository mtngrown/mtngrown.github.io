</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 23 2019</time>
<p>Going to attempt The Great Retreat this game. I've never done
that before, but if it works, it will take Polish Front out
of the game, which can only be a good thing.</p>

Czech moves right. Action roll 5 to move Czech back.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>49</code> National Parliament Reconvened. I do not understand
the effect "National readjustment is successful." Ok this
means I can get all of the Revolts out for free. Very helpful</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>50</code> Czech Declaration of Independence. Spend an Aid to
keep the Czechs out of Revolt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>37</code> Caporetto Offensive.  Ugly, the Italians are on the move.
Spend a Radio Intercept to cancel Italian advance. Croat Revolt,
this is bad, Italians need a natural 6 to move back. I think I
pretty much lost this game. Italians back 1 with help from MacKensen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>40</code> Toscani Armstice. Italians back 1. NW -4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>46</code> Dismissal of Conrad. Italian and Carpathian advance,
cancel the Carpathian, Carpathians back, Italians back with
some help from Mackensen. NW -1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>48</code> D'Esperey Breaks Out. Balkan advances into Vienna and
that's the game. That one snuck up on me!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I played the revolts incorrectly two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The game ends <em>instantly</em> when all three are in
Revolt. I played that they had to be out of Revolt at
the end of the turn.</li>
  <li>Along with that, I played that ties lose when resolving
adjustments, when in fact, ties and greater move loyalty to
the right.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm figuring these more or less balance each other out.</p>

<p>The Balkan Front definitely blindsided me. Did not see that coming at
all.</p>

<p>Some things I did well were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Stocking up on Resources early which let me amass enough
wins to remove the Polish Front via The Great Retreat. I think
this is critical, I can't imagine winning the game without this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Revolts don't have to be cleared immediately, but it is
important as above to keep loyalty a bit to the right. I may
still be missing important techniques for controlling Revolts.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
