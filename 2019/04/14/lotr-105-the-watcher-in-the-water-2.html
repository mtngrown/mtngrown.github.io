<p>Round 2 against The Watcher in the Water, using my tried and true "Deeds
of Dwarves" deck. I don't think this deck will end up being very good
for beating this quest, but I need to bang on it a few times before I
start morphing. My hunch is that I'm going to need to pull in a load of
healing resources from Lore, it's all those tentacles thrashing about.
We'll see.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fili</li>
  <li>Parting Gifts</li>
  <li>Erebor Record Keeper</li>
  <li>Forest Snare</li>
  <li>Longbeard Orc Slqyer</li>
  <li>Dwarven Tomb</li>
</ol>

<p>Initial encounter: Makeshift Passage and Stair Falls for 3 &gt; 2 threat.
Nasty start.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Fili.</li>
  <li>Planning: None.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, draw Thrashing Tentacle, net +2 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Makeshift Passage, +2 Progress.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Thrashing Tentacle.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dain defends, shadow Turbulent Waters for no effect, Dain
takes no damage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Gloin</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Fili and Kili, Erebor RK.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, Erebor RK for 9 Will, draw Bitter Wind
and discard resources.  That's ok, can handle it this round.
Net 7 to clear Makeshift Passage and net +2 P on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Thrashing tentacle engaged.</li>
  <li>Combat: Fili defends, shadow Warg Lair for no effect,
but Fili is dead.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Erebor RK, Longbeard MM.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gloin</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, ERK x 2 for 11 Will, draw Wrapped!
attach to Ori. Net +9 to clear "To the West-Door."</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Exhaust Dain to discard Wrapped! from Ori. Kili
defends Thrashing Tentacle, shadow Black Uruks for no effect
on defended attack. Gloin does 1 hit of damage on Thrashing
Tentacle.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is an interesting point. With a little bit of luck on the
Encounter card draw, I might be able to knock this thing down
in a turn or two. On the other hand, if I pull a bunch of Tentacle
engagement cards, it could well drag on a long time, with decreasing
chance to win until all the tentacles are cleared. I perhaps should
have stalled a little bit longer to get more allies out of my draw deck.
That would also have served to clear a few tentacles out of the deck
as well. In any case, onward!</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Gandalf, Cram. Awesome.</li>
  <li>Planning: Cram on Thorin, Fili, Kili.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, ERK x 2 for 7 Will, draw Grasping
Tentacle for -1 net, Threat 35. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Grasping Tentacle.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gloin defend Thrashing, shadow Knees of the Mountain
for no effect, 2 hits on Gloin. Thorin defends Grasping, shadow Mountain
Warg and will deal damage to ERK. Fili and Kili take out Grasping,
Dain exhausts to take out Thrashing (leaving Cram still on Thorin).</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<p>With a tiny bit of luck, I'll pull Henamarth and be able to scry.
Pretty sure I can beat it at that point.</p>

<p>Note: I think I forgot to apply the shadow effect for Grasping Tentacle,
which would have probably been Black Uruks damage?</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Dwarven Tomb, Forest Snare.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Fili, ERK for 7 Will, draw Black Uruks which is
a discard of Cram from Thorin, bummer. Net -1 Threat 37. On the
other hand, since there is no Tentacle in play, I can engage The
Watcher, take a nasty hit, then Forest Snare that bad boy next
round. Then it's a matter of building my allies back up and
chewing away at it. I'm feeling good about this one so far, which
means I better take care.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Black Uruks, The Watcher.</li>
  <li>Combat: Kili defends Watcher, shadow Grasping Tentacle for
no effect, Kili is dead. Gloin defends Black Uruks, shadow
Bitter Wind. Brutal! Will barely be able to play Forest Snare.
Thorin and Dain kill Black Uruks.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat. 38.</li>
</ol>

<p>Parting Gifts will let me move the resources I need to play
Forest Snare.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Forest Snare and Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Parting Gifts to move 2 R from Thorin to Ori, who
plays Forest Snare on The Watcher. I'm running short on Dwarvesâ€¦</li>
  <li>Quest: Oriand ERK for 5 Will, draw Perilous Swamp for net -1
and Threat 39. Risking location lock now.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: shadow Makeshift Passage on Watcher, which is snared.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm running out of dwarves. This is not good.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Bifur, Longbeard Orc Slayer.</li>
  <li>Planning: Longbeard, just in case.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Thorin, ERK for 9 Will, draw Striking
Tentacle. Ugh. Net 1 P.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Striking Tentacle.</li>
  <li>Combat: Fili defend Striking, shadow Grasping
Tentacle for 4 hits on Dain. Dain and Longbeard
kill Striking.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is going to be tough. Trying to get rid of Doors of
Durin seems dumb with a single player.  In a multiplayer game,
this might be a lot smarter thing to do.</p>

<p>It's looking sketchier and sketchier to win this. Two
Sneak Attacks would do it.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Longbeard MM, Durin's Song.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Longbeard OS and Miner of the Iron Hills. No more
resources.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, Fili, ERK for 11 Will, draw Striking Tentacle
for net 3, need 1 more Progress to clear quest card.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Striking Tentacle.</li>
  <li>Combat: Miner defends Striking Tentacle, shadow Thrashing
Tentacle, 4 hits on Thorin. The Longbeards take it out.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw King Under the Mountain and Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play King Under the Mountain on Dain, exhaust to draw
Cram and Bifur. Play Cram on Dain. Play Durin' Song on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Ori, ERK for 11 Will (with Durin's Song), draw
Black Uruks which discards Cram from Thorin, which is a disaster.
Durin's Song is basically wasted with respect to taking out The
Watcher. Sadly, having ERK exhausted means I can't use him to ready
Thorin either.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Black Uruks.</li>
  <li>Combat: Miner defends, shadow Perilous Swamp remove 1 P from
current quest, no big deal. Miner is killed. Longbeards OS take
out Black Uruks.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Durin's Song, Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: King Under the Mountain, draw Unexpected Courage and
Untroubled by Darkness, keep Unexpected Courage. Durin's Song
on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Fili for 5 Will, draw Disturbed Water which is
Doomed 5 for Threat 48! With 6 in Staging Area, we have Threat
now is 49, which means this is the last round regardless.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Let's see if we can take out The Watcher: Thorin brings 3
for himself, +1 from Dain, +2 from Durin's Song for 6 total. Ori is readied from
Erebor Record Keeper and brings 2 + 1 for 3 total giving 9 so far.
Each Longbeard 2 + 1 for 6 total, giving 15 total and we need 16
total to beat it. The Watcher takes 8 hits, it's just not enough.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 50.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's the game. I think stalling just a little bit more up front
would have been helpful, but have to be careful with that due to Bitter
Wind and the damned tentacles.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
