Game Day at Dos Palmas
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  6 2019</time>
<p>A long anticipated event, announced many weeks ago, with full attendance
of AS, SK, and AW. The goal: play some Ogre, specifically at ODE scale.</p>

<p>After some discussion, we settled on a team play of the classic
Breakthrough scenario, but on a double map G1/S1, with each team
splitting forces and taking charge of one of the maps. For example,
I started as an attacker on the S1 map, teammate SK on the G1 map.</p>

<p>After both sides had some secret negotions, we set it up and got going.</p>

<p>Here's the story.</p>

<h3 id="breakthrough-i">Breakthrough I</h3>

<p>Game 40.</p>

<p>Sk and I started as attacking Combine forces, taking a mix of GEV and
Light GEV. The Pan Euro forces set up as hidden until they either move
of fire. Here's the situation very early in the game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ogre/g40-earlygame.jpg" alt="Early game for team play Breakthrough" /></p>

<p>Note that all the stacks are out of maximum possible howitzer range of 8
hexes.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Pan Euro chose to defend with a lot of Heavy Tanks,
which are actually not bad in a lot of scenarios, but in this one,
they don't provide enough armor to create a decent line. This provided
opportunity for Combine forces to bunch up and punch a hole in the line.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ogre/g40-midgame.jpg" alt="Mid game team Breakthrough" /></p>

<p>We focused our forces and punched a massive hole in this line on the G1
board, and drove through for 220 VPs, needing only 50 to win. Not the
Pan Euro's finest hour. Here's what that hole looked like near the end
of the game:</p>

<h3 id="breakthrough-ii">Breakthrough II</h3>

<p>Game 41.</p>

<p>In an alternate universe, Breakthrough again, swapping sides  such that
SK and I are the defending Pan Euro.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous game where the defense used Heavy Tanks, this game
we used light tanks, which are awesome for defending. They have a lot of
movement (M3) and are cheap, so it's easy to fill the map with them. In
a timed game like Breakthrough, even serving as speedbumps can be
valuable. Here's what the Pan Euro line looked like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ogre/g41-setup.jpg" alt="Pan Euro with light tank setup" /></p>

<p>It's easy to see there are many more units on this line than there were
in the previous games. Pan Euro even broke down infantry squads to
create an illusion of even more units. This works pretty well as single
squad infantry units still get a heft defense bonus in Forest and City
hexes.</p>

<p>Compounding the attacker's difficulties is their decision to attack on a
broad front instead of attempting to punch through. Also, PE got first
fire if I recall correctly, alway a good thing in Ogre. (A design flaw
in my opinion.) We held the line, the attackers only escaped 4-5 units,
and scored -57.  They were crushingly defeated.</p>

<p>I did not take any pictures of the end game, which is a pity.</p>

<p>This was followed by tasty ham and cheese panini for lunch.</p>

<h2 id="frag">Frag</h2>

<p>I picked up Frag many years ago from Amazon as it was super cheap, less
than $20 if I recall correctly. I did try to play it solo once, and got
a few moves in, but it was really hard to get engaged with it. Frag
really is one of these games where the fun is in playing with a good
group of people who enjoy blowing stuff up and otherwise being silly
in a game.</p>

<p>For this game, SK and AS had to leave, which is perfect, Frag lends
itself to playing a few rounds then leaving the game. I could see it
similarly to having people walk into a game after it has been started.</p>

<p>In any case, it's super fun lightweight, perfect for after heavier
games, and great with multiple people. As noted, SK and AS left after
a couple of rounds, and I was able to frag AW again pretty fast after
that for the win.</p>

<p>For another description of the game play, AW has played the game a lot,
even has a 3D custom board, but he didn't even got a shot off in this
game!</p>

<h2 id="absolutely-aces">Absolutely Aces</h2>

<p>AW and I gave a shot at figuring this out. It's definitely a weird little game.</p>

<p>We found cycles right away, but we did not find how to break cycles
reliably. It felt to us that some cycles were unbreakable barring a
"typo" from one of the players, that is, one of the players making an
accidental mistake in game play.</p>

<p>Will have to spend a bit more time with this figure it out.</p>

<h2 id="race-for-the-galaxy">Race for the Galaxy</h2>

<p>Game 18!</p>

<p>Still having trouble getting this game off the ground. I saw how to win
with New Sparta though, there is a specific development which multiplies
points on military worlds. It's pretty critical.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
