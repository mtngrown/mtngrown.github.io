Absolutely Aces solo (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 21 2019</time>
<p>Note: I started this play through months ago, then played it
with EW in the meantime, then finished the play through for
a second play as dated here.</p>

<p>I've had this tiny little card game on the table a couple of times, and
haven't been able to figure it out. This time I'm bent on it. I set it
up a couple of days ago, and I'm bound and determined to learn it. The
way I'm going to learn it is by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write out the rules here and annotate parts I do not understand.
The rules are very short, so there is probably something implicit
I am not understanding.</li>
  <li>Play through a game or two writing out each card play in detail.</li>
  <li>Post the card play to the game forum to validate my understanding.</li>
</ol>

<p>The opponents will be Kaff and Schlock.</p>

<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>

<p><strong>START OF ROUND</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Shuffle the deck and deal each player 5 cards.</li>
  <li>Each player secretly chooses and reveals one card, simultaneously.</li>
  <li>The player who chose the highest-numbered card discards it
and will go first.</li>
  <li>The other player's card is placed in the first player's Reserve.</li>
  <li>Both players reveal their cards (Hands are open).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ON YOUR GO</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Play an eligible card from your Hand to your opponent's Reserve.</li>
  <li>The take the card from your Reserve (if any) into your hand.</li>
  <li>On the first player's first go, any card is eligible; after that,
each player MUST play a card that BLOCKS the card just played, or
must play a PAIR.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PAIRS</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If your Hand has two cards of the same type (e.g., both ROLL
cards), you may play BOTH at once to block ANY card.</li>
  <li>Instead of placing the Pair in your opponent's Reserve, remove
the two cards from the game.</li>
  <li>Only two Pairs total can be played in a Round; you cannot play
a Pair if it would be the third played that Round.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SCORING</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>When a player is unable to Block, they lose the Round.</li>
  <li>The other player scores points equal to the value of the
last card they played, plus one extra point if the card
was a Heart instead of a Spade.</li>
  <li>If a player wins the Round by playing a Pair, they score
2 points, only.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's the rules verbatim from the cards.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Kaff opens with H4 Break, Schlock with H8 Roll, Schlock
is first player, H4 Break goes to Schlock's Reserve, H8 Roll
is discarded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opponents reveal their hands:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Kaff with: H10 Roll, S1 Ace, S11 Swoop, S7 Climb.</li>
  <li>Schlock with H12 Joker, H6 Climb, H2 Scissors, S9 Swoop.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>The game commences.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Schlock plays Swoop, which Kaff cannot block. Kaff
takes Swoop and plays Climb. 9 points to Schlock.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schlocks blocks with Climb, Kaff answers with Roll.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
