LotR 107 - The Long Dark (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 25 2019</time>
<p>Deeds of Dwarves takes on <em>The Long Dark</em>. These first plays are always
extra exciting as I do not read the quests or look at the encounter deck
before playing. So I have absolutely no idea what I'm getting myself
into.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Forest Snare</li>
  <li>Bifur</li>
  <li>Narvi's Belt</li>
  <li>Dwarven Tomb</li>
  <li>Forest Snare</li>
  <li>Dwalin</li>
</ol>

<p>Not a great initial hand, but since I have Narvi's Belt, I think
it's worth a go. If I get a little bit lucky on the first couple
of turns, it should be all right. We'll see!</p>

<p>Encounter set up: discard Foul Air to reveal The Mountain's Root
for Threat X, which will be 2 in this case. This is decent, could
be hugely worse I suspect.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Miner of the Iron Hills, not so useful,
really need some Leadership mojo here.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Narvi's Belt on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori for 3 Will, draw Burning Low for net 0 on the
quest. That's fine.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Mountain's Roots.</li>
  <li>Encounter: None.</li>
  <li>Combat: None.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Untroubled by Darkness.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori and Miner for 4 Will, draw Goblin Follower. The Mountain's
Roots is cleared, net +3 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Follower is engaged.</li>
  <li>Combat: Thorin will take this as undefended, and let's hope no
Shadow here…draw ROck Adder! Discard Miner of the Iron Hills. Bummer,
but could have been a lot worse. Thorin and Dain kill Goblin Follower.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, draw Gathering Ground, no effect as no locations
in Staging Area. Net +3 Progress to quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is pretty cool, but I do need to get some allies out there
to get the Dwarf Swarm started. This just isn't cutting it!
A weakness of the deck is the number of Lore/Spirit when those
cards come up early. Super strong when they come up later.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Parting Gifts. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, save for 1 more round.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, draw Zigil Mineshaft. Play Cave Torch and draw
Silent Caverns. Raise Threat to 36, clear Zigil, net +3 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Things could get very hairy, very quickly, I don't have any
allies out.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: Going to have a pay a lot to get some allies out.
There is no help for it. Playing Dwalin and Bifur, but not
going to use Bifur's draw. I hope I don't lose either of these
this round.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori and Dwalin for 5 Will, draw The Mountain's Roots
for Threat 2, net +3 Progress with 12/13 on the quest. This
scenario is taking it very easy on me.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Mountain's Roots.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Gandalf and King Under the Mountain.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play King Under the Mountain on Dain. Exhaust to draw
Kili and Erebor RK, keep Kili and play using Narvi's Belt to get
Fili on the table. Now we're doing well, can soak up some attacks.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Fili, and Kili for 7 Will, draw Burning Low for no
effect! The Mountain's Roots and the quest are cleared, on to
card 2B: Locate test, discard Parting Gifts draw Dwarven Forge
for a PASS.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Henamarth Riversong and Forest Snare.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Henamarth and Scry Foul Air. Woooo that's
going to be a tough one…</li>
  <li>Quest: All but Dain for 9 + 6 (Dain) for 15, play
Untroubled by Darkness for +6 for 21, draw Foul Air and start
discarding for Locate Test: Forest Snare draw Goblin Warlord,
Forest Snare again and draw Cave Spider, Dwarven Tomb draw
Abandoned Mine for PASS. And that's a win.</li>
</ol>

<p>This quest is rated a 7, but somehow I managed to slip right
through the cracks. I could see how with more players, this
thing could be really, really tough once things started backing
up.</p>

<p>I'm due to lose something really badly.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
