Absolutely Aces (4, 5)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 29 2019</time>
<p>This "play" is a sequence of 3 plays drawn from a forum article
demonstrating how to play the game. I'm calling it a single play
as I'm spending time on all three examples to understand the mechanics.</p>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

<p>Player 1 (we'll call them Snoopy [Schlock]) gets Scissors (2), Break (4),
Climb (6), Roll (8),
Swoop (11). They bid Swoop (11 of spades), their highest value card.</p>

<p>Player 2 (the Baron [Kaff]) gets Ace (1), Break (5), Swoop (9), Roll (10),
Joker (12). I could make an argument for bidding their Roll (10 of hearts)
banking on the chance that the other player didn't get the other Swoop,
but of course we already know that he did, and anyway the safe play is
to bid the Joker.</p>

<p>The two cards left out of this game are: Scissors (3) and Climb (7).</p>

<p>So the Joker (12) is removed, Snoopy's Swoop (11) goes into reserve for
the Baron, and the Baron goes first.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Baron opens with Swoop (9) and takes Swoop (11) from Reserve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy can block with Scissors or Break. Only the Ace can block
Scissors since Snoopy has the only Climb. Snoopy plays Scissors (2)
and takes Swoop (9) from Reserve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron blocks with the Ace (1) and takes Scissors (2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy blocks with Break (4) and takes the Ace (1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron could block with Break (5) but they'd rather keep the pair,
and force the Ace out of Snoopy's hand. So they play Roll (10),
which can only be blocked by Scissors (of which Snoopy has none)
or the Ace. Baron takes Break (4).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy is forced to block with Ace (1) and takes Roll (10).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obvious play for the Baron is Swoop (11) because it can
only be blocked by the Roll pair, which will make it impossible
for Snoopy to block a Break. Baron takes Ace (1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy plays the Roll pair, removing them from the game, and
taking Swoop (11) into their hand.</p>

    <p>(<em>Right here is confusing, removing the cards from the game implies
 to me there is nothing which needs to be blocked</em>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron plays Scissors (2) and takes nothing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy blocks with Climb (6) and takes Scissors (2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron plays the Break pair to win.</p>

    <p>This is where the writeup ends. And I'm confused as "win" to me implies
the game is over, hence the writeup ends. If the game continues past
here, why did not the writeup continue?</p>

    <p>I'm going to continue the game and see where it goes from here. The
score at the moment is 2-2. Baron takes Climb (6).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy plays Swoop (11) takes nothing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron blocks with Ace take Swoop (11).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy blocks with Scissors (2) takes Ace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron blocks with Climb (6) takes Scissors (2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy blocks with Ace takes Climb (6).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron blocks with Swoop (11) takes Ace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy cannot block, Baron scores 11, Snoopy plays Climb (6) takes
Swoop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron blocks with Ace takes Climb (6).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy blocks with Swoop (9) takes Ace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron blocks with Scissors (2) takes Swoop (9).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy blocks with Ace takes Scissors (2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron blocks with Climb (6) takes Ace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy cannot block, game over for Baron win with 17.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="game-5">Game 5</h3>

<p>Snoopy gets Ace (1), Scissors (3), Climb (7), Roll (8), Swoop (9). This
is an interesting hand because he knows that the Baron will have at
least one card that's a higher number. What Snoopy is doing then isn't
bidding to go first, but deciding what card to give his opponent. He
decides to give up Climb (7).</p>

<p>The Baron gets Break, Break, Climb, Roll, Joker. He decides to bid the
Roll (10) to see if he can't stick Snoopy with that lousy Joker card at
some point, gumming up his opponent's hand.</p>

<p>The two leftover cards are Scissors (2) and Swoop (11).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Baron sees that he'll be getting a Climb at the end of the turn,
which will give him two pairs. He decides to open with the Joker
(12). (<em><strong>NOTE: THE FIRST PLAYER DOES NOT HAVE TO BLOCK THE INITIAL
CARD AT THE START OF THE GAME, THAT CARD JUST GOES INTO HIS
RESERVE.</strong></em>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy blocks with Roll (8) as that forces removal of a pair. He
  takes the Joker (12).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron responds with the Climb pair, takes Roll (8).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snoopy's only option is the Ace (1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baron plays Break (5) to win. (<em>the handâ€¦ as mentioned above, "win"
in these descriptions seems to mean "scoring the hand"</em>. We continue.)</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<p>And that's it for Game 5, and I think I'm going to put this away for
a while. Overall, I think it's probably a very good game, but the way
the rules were written, and how the example was worded, just didn't
work for me out of the box (as it were). I'm sure the designer is fine
with this, I'm simply not in his audience. And that's ok.</p>

<p>I may get it out later. I'd really like to watch a play through video
by the designer, or a designer-approved video.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I do not understand why this game has been so hard to learn.
It has to be the rules, which are simply unclear to me. The
might well be clear to others, but I'm just not getting it.
I'm not alone, one of my irregular opponents was unable to
figure it out either, and he has many, many years of experience
with games.</p>

<hr />

<p>They only happen because the whole country is just full of people who
when these things happen they just say "these things happen" and that's
why they happen. Ethel Merman in It's a mad mad mad world.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
