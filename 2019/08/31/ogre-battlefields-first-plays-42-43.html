Ogre Battlefields first plays (42, 43)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 31 2019</time>
<p>Game Day at Dos Palmas, with the usual Ogre pushers in attendance.
Today's games featured maps and scenarios from the Battlefiels release,
which was kickstarted and arrived a few weeks ago. This is the first
time any of us have played this release.</p>

<h2 id="game-42-breakthrough">Game 42 Breakthrough</h2>

<p>Breakthrough on the new S maps, with 8 howitzers on defense, 4 fixed and
4 mobile.</p>

<p>We paired off with myself and AS, and SK and AW.</p>

<p>I defended and lost this one, deployed my howitzers on the wrong side of
the map. Here's what the start looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ogre/g42-start-vatican.jpg" alt="Breakthrough on S3" /></p>

<p>SK defended and (as usual) won. Then they switched side and SK attacked
and (as usual) won.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ogre/bt2-combine-s3-start.jpg" alt="Another Breakthrough on S3" /></p>

<h2 id="game-43-raid">Game 43 Raid</h2>

<p>Raid on the new S maps. It turns out I did pretty well against our local
Ogre shark, came close to a draw. I made a critical mistake leaving some
lgevs in a stack at close of turn, whence they were overrun by a
superheavy on the next turn. Pretty cool scenario though, would be happy
to play it again.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
