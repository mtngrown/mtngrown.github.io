LotR 112 - Passage Through Mirkwood (25) with Thanee's single core
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 14 2019</time>
<p>I built <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/13836/journeydowntheanduinwithonlyasinglecoreset-1.0">Thanee's Journey Down the Anduin
deck</a>
months ago, but never got around to playing it. It's similar to the
Basic Tri-sphere I've used in the past (and keep a built copy handy).
Passage Through Mirkwood seemed like a nice way to give it a test spin.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>Daughter of the Nimrodel</li>
  <li>Dwarven Axe</li>
  <li>Northern Tracker</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Faramir</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Gimli, Theodred, draw Forest Spider for net +2
Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road, ready Gimli.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spiders</li>
  <li>Combat: both undefended, against Gimli with shadow King Spider
for no effect, Gimli takes 2 hits. Theodred defends, shadow
Necromancer's Pass for no effect, takes 2 hits.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: Dwarven Axe on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred draw Great Forest Web for net +3
and clear Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: nothing new</li>
  <li>Combat: Play Sneak Attack Gandalf for 4 damage on first
Forest Spider. Gandalf defends other Forest Spider with shadow
Caught in a Web, Gimli swings for 6 to destroy second Forest
Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Eowyn, draw Dol Goldur Orcs, 2 hits to Eowyn
will save A Test of Will a little longer. Net +1 Progess.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, shadow Necromancer's Pass for no effect,
Gimli takes no damage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Northern Tracker and Faramir.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Northern Tracker, draw Enchanted Stream for net +1
Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: exhaust Theodred for Great Forest Web.</li>
  <li>Encounter: nothing new</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir defends, shadow The Necromancer's Reach for no
effect Faramir takes no hits. Gimli kills Dol Goldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Celebrian's Stone.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Faramir, Northern Tracker, draw Forest Spider for
net +6 Progress which clears Great Forest Web and Flies and Spiders.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider</li>
  <li>Combat: Theodred defends Forest Spider, shadow Mountains of Mirkwood
for no effect, Theodred takes 1 hit, Gimli kills Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Northern Tracker clear Enchanted Stream draw
Caught in a Web, attach to Gimli, who has the most resources
right now at 5. A Fork in the Road cleared, start Beorn's Path.
This is interesting as I might be able to beat this quest on
the next turn, no need to dig out Ungoliant's Spawn. As long as
I don't get Hummerhorns, I think it's good.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Lorien Guide.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Faramir, Northern Tracker for 12
Will, Sneak Attack Gandalf in for 3 card draw Feint, Quike
Strike, and Citadel Plate. Total Will 17 draw Ungoliant's Spawn!
Pay 1 from Eowyn to negate the When Revealed -1 Will.
What are the freakin' odds! This is actually pretty cool because
at this point I don't really need to quest now, and I have a
couple of Feints.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ungoliant's Spawn.</li>
  <li>Combat: Feint and attack with Gimli for 4 damage on Ungoliant's
Spawn.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35. Pay 2 to ready Gimli.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Beorn.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw The Necromancer's Reach, deal 1 damage
to Eowyn.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: nothing new.</li>
  <li>Combat: Feint, and everybody in for the win.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Only one real mistake on this game, which is not discarding Daughter
of Nimrodel for later extraction via Stand and Fight. To be fair, it
would have probably cost me a turn though.</p>

<p>This was fun. I'm going to play it with other decks as well, just to see
how it works. I wish I'd played it with Deeds of Dwarves, but I already
broke that deck down. (I need to proxy cards from the adventure packs to
have multiple decks going.)</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
