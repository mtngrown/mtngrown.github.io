LotR 113 - Passage Through Mirkwood (26) with Rohan to the Rescue!
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 21 2019</time>
<p>One of the many cool things about the LotR card game is the
ability to build player decks focused around various themes.
For example, the Dwarrowdelf cycle lends itself to building
"dwarf swarm" decks, which focus on getting a lot of dwarf
allies into play, which allows a lot of leverage.</p>

<p>With both the Core box and the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle being rich with
Rohan characters, I decided to build my first Rohan deck, "Rohan to the
Rescue!" Let's see how it plays.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Escort from Edoras</li>
  <li>Valiant Sacrifice</li>
  <li>Steward of Gondor</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Astonishing Speed</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure why I have Sneak Attack in this deck, because I do not have
Gandalf. Let's roll with it and see what happens.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Ever Vigilant.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Escort from Edoras to get a jump on the
quest progress.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Escort from Edoras for 9 Will,
draw Forest Spider. Ok, a little ugly, but can deal with it
hopefully with no shadow cards. Net +4 on quest. Resource
to Theodred.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road, ready Theodred.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Both spiders.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dunhere defending, shadow Caught in a Web for no effect,
takes 1 hit. Theodred defending, shadow Driven by Shadow, no attachments
to discard, hence no effect, 1 hit on Theodred.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 26.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Steward of Gondor on Dunhere. Exhaust to
gain +2 R. Play Stand and Fight to draw Escort From Edoras
back into play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Escort from Edoras for 8 Will, draw Necromancer's
Pass. Old Forest Road is cleared, +2 Progress on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: Necromancer's Pass, discard Sneak Attack and Ever Vigilant.</li>
  <li>Encounter: nothing new.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dunhere defending, shadow Old Forest Road for no effect,
take 1 hit. Theodred defending, shadow Hummerhorns, everybody takes
a hit.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 27.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Snowbourn Scout, excellent, a chump.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Necromancer's Reach, Eowyn takes a hit!
Quest advances to <em>A Fork In the Road</em>. 2 Progress, easy peasy.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: nothing new.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defending, shadow King Spider, force
exhaust of Dunhere, Scout is dead. Theodred defending, shadow Dol
Goldur Orcs for +1 attack, this is a kill on Theodred. It might
not matter that much, let's play it out.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<p>Where are the freakin' locations?</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw The Riddermark's Finest.</li>
</ol>

<p>No possible way to win this, the Forest Spiders will kill
both Dunhere and Eowyn this round.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I think perhaps I should put some Gandalf in this deck.</p>

<p>I do think this deckis viable for PtM. I'll need to play it a couple
more times to find out. Very curious how it will fare against Journey
Along the Anduin.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
