</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 22 2019</time>
<p>Another spin with Rohan to the Rescue! I'm playing this game
interstitially between chores. I don't have that many chores today, but

  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn't clear the location with Riddermark's Finest, even though I
could have. It let me get a kill. If I can use it again, I'm net ahead,
because that paid for the card more or less.</p>

this turn, I should have played Eomund this turn, Will of the West
next turn, because I'm out of resources.)</li>

and Theodred for 5 Will, draw Necromancer's Reachâ€¦no big deal

no effect, Snowbourn Scout is no more. Theodred readies, with Dunhere,
Elheim, 6 Attack for 4 hits on Ungoliant. Had I played Eomund, I could

Ungoliant's Spawn for the win.</li>
</ol>

<p>This was a fun game!</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I think this one went pretty well. The Rohan mechanic is workable for
fairly low powered encounters. It really does need the card and resource
acceleration to get moving. Sadly, looking ahead doesn't reveal much
more power for Rohan for a long time, many, many quests in the future.
I think I'm going to keep it togther though, just to have some fun with
it once in a while.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
