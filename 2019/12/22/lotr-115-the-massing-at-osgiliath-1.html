LotR 115 - The Massing at Osgiliath (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 22 2019</time>
<p>This is a print-on-demand scenario first delivered at GenCon 2011, about
half way through Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. I'm going to play it with
Thanee's single core and see where I get. Will be doing some chores
along the way, because that just makes sense.</p>

<p>Chore 1: Line up math, personal info arch, and Anki projects to complete
the weekend. This game is going to work through details for information
syncing for my personal S3 buckets. Terraform is an integral component
of that, so I'll read the terraform book along with the game play.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Valiant Sacrifice</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Daughter of the Nimrodel</li>
  <li>Northern Tracker</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>Dwarven Axe</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw The Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Wainriders for -2, Threat 30.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Snaga Scouts, Wolves from Mordor.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snaga undefended, shadow Ranger of Ithilien, deal 2 damage
to Snaga Scouts to kill, exhaust Theodred to acquire Ranger, Gimli
defend Wolves from Morder shadow Snaga Scouts for no effect, taking
2 hits. Ranger of Ithilien applies 1 hit to Wolves.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Chore 2: ok this is not going to work, it's too committing. I'll need to
figure out some other sort of chores.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Steward of Gondor on Eowyn, I have cards
I can play next turn with it. Play Gandalf for 4 damage on
one of the Wainriders.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Cut Off, discard all allies from hand,
which would be Northern Tracker and Daughter of the Nimrodel.
Net +2 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none, leave the Wainriders alone for now, they're only
Threat 2 in the staging area, and I can't kill them without risking
a lot of damage (i.e., dead Gimli).</li>
  <li>Combat: Gandalf defends Wolves, shadow Emyn Arnen overlook for no
effect, Gimli kills Wolves.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32, play Valiant Sacrifice as Gandalf leaves play to
draw Feint and Faramir. Good cards!</li>
</ol>

<p>Chore 2: Bah. I don't have anything easy to do…</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Citadel Plate.</li>
  <li>Planning: play The Galadrimh's Greetings, Threat 26.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Ruins of Osgiliath, Threat 27.</li>
  <li>Travel: Ruins of Osgiliath.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Quick Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Ranger of Ithilien, surge Captured
Watchtower.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Engage Wainriders.</li>
  <li>Combat: Play Quick Strike, Gimli takes out Wainriders.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Stand and Fight to put Northern Tracker into play,
play Faramir.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Faramir, one Ranger, draw Ruins of Osgiliath
for Threat 8, net +5 which clears current Ruins of Osgiliath. Major
blunder not questing with Northern Tracker, I could have cleared these
next turn.</li>
  <li>Travel: Ruins of Osgiliath.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: Citadel Plate on Gimli. I'm overdue for some big
enemies.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker, Faramir, seems like
overkill, and risky if surge happens, but let's see the draw: Snaga
Scouts. Net +7 Progess, clear Ruins of Osgiliath and <em>Beyond
Expectations</em>, start <em>Through the Ruins</em>.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Snaga Scouts.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, shadow Snaga Scouts for no effect. That's all
the Snaga in the deck, more than half the scouts remain, but should be
doable with my current tableaux.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Snowbourn Scout, excellent!</li>
  <li>Planning: Snowbourn Scout, which clears Captured Watchtower.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Faramir, draw Wolves from Mordor,
<em>Through the Ruins</em> is cleared. Advance to <em>Anduin Crossing</em>.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wolves from Mordor.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, shadow Ruins of Osgiliath for no effect,
Gimli takes 2 hits. Rangers kill Wolves.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 16, draw Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Faramir discarding one Ranger,
draw Wolves from Mordor, clear <em>Anduin Crossing</em> and here
comes the Witch King I'm sure! Yep, and we're in the <em>Race
to Minas Tirith</em>.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wolves from Mordor.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, shadow…remove all defending characters from
combat. This attack is considered undefended. Well, fine, Gimli can take
it, just barely, and will be swinging for 10!</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 18, draw Unexpected Courage. Heh.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Unexpected Courage on Gimli. Play Gandalf
for 4 damage to Witch King.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Faramir, Northern Tracker, draw Uruk Vanguard,
yow that's ugly, but Threat 45 so we'll just let that stew in
the staging area. Net +4 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: pull down the Witch King.</li>
  <li>Combat: play Feint, do a lot of damage to the Witch King,
like 16 or something, and that's not even readying Gimli. I probably
could have ended it this turn with more questing, but let's not get
overly rash.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw The Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Quest: all but Gimli and Snowbourn Scout, draw Dark Pursuit which
gains surge as there are no Scouts in the staging area, draw Morgulduin.
Net +14 which clears <em>Race to Minas Tirith</em> for the win.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This was both easier and more fun than I thought it would be. I don't
think I made any gross errors on this play.</p>

<p>I want to replay this with the Basic Tri-sphere deck, which will be
slightly different.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
