LotR 116 - Shadow and Flame (3)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 23 2019</time>
<p>I built <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/185887">The Balrog Brigade</a>
deck specifically to take on Shadow and Flame.
This is a pretty brutal scenario, starts with a Balrog in play.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resourceful</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Dwarrowdelf Axe</li>
  <li>Out of Sight</li>
  <li>Fili</li>
</ol>

<p>Not looking like a great hand. Mulligan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sang of Travel</li>
  <li>Renewed Friendship</li>
  <li>Citadel Plate</li>
  <li>Veteran Axehand</li>
  <li>Quick Strike</li>
  <li>Bofur</li>
</ol>

<p>A little better I think. Let's play.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Erebor Battlemaster.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Veteran Axehand, Threat 0. Song of Travel on Thalin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Nori, Thalin, draw Many Thonged Whip. Would like to be
able to cancel this "When Revealed" text, don't have the cards for it.
Need A Test of Will which I put in Sideboard. Net +1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 1.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Nori, Thalin, draw Inner Flame, net +1</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 2.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: Citadel Plate on Gimli, Renewed Friendship to drive
Threat to 0.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Nori, Thalin, draw Inner Flame. I think I need to
shuffle the encounter deck better. Net +1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 1.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Citadel Plate.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Nori, Thalin, draw Second Deep. Threat +2 for 3.
Durin's Bane coming down.</li>
  <li>Travel: Second Deep.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Durin's Bane.</li>
  <li>Combat: Will take it undefended on Gimli, shadow Whip Lash, which
I'm going to cancel with Hasty Stroke. 6 hits on Gimli. Dang. Discard
Bofur.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 4.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Heavy Stroke. Hope this doesn't get
discarded.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Citadel Plate on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Nori, Thalin, draw Chance Encounter, which results in
Surge Leading Flame. Gimli defends, shadow Counter-Spell for no
effect. Gimli with 10 hits. Threat 5.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: nothing new.</li>
  <li>Combat: Veteran Axehand defends, shadow Ranging Goblin for no
effect. Veteran Axehand to the discard.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 6.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a lot of "When Revealed" effects in this quest.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Fili.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Stand and Fight to bring Veteran Axehand
back into play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Nori, Thalin, draw Leading Flame, and that's the game.
Leading Flame requires an immediate attack, which will take out
Veteran Axehand, and the next attack will take out a hero. Along
with the random discard, not really any chance from here.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This is going to be a tough quest to crack, for sure. I need to
roll in 3 "A Test of Will" cards immediately, and figure out
how I can get a bit more questing involving. I may need to go
tri-sphere with Dain to get the quest boosts.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
