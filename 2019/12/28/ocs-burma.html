OCS Burma (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 28 2019</time>
<p>[Note: game initially set up June 29, 2019.]</p>

<p>I have the super small learning scenario set up, and hope to play
through it over the next few days. OCS is so committing, but I really
want to play at least 1-2 games of it per year, just to keep the rules
semi-fresh. Burma is highly regarded, although probably right at the
edge of what makes sense in the operational combat system. A lot of
special, theater-specific rules to account for the weirdness of the
situation.</p>

<p>As it turns out there is a pretty good youtube video on <a href="/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap7li9WSllo">Black
Cats vs White Tigers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="game-turn-1">Game Turn 1</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the upcoming turn for both sides.</p>

<p>This is the start of the game. I haven't played OCS in probably 2 years,
so I'm really rusty with it. (I've also a got a few other games going on
the side, and I'm super rusty on <em>all</em> the rules for everything.) It's a
good thing I have the turn sequence already written out, no way I'd
attempt this otherwise.</p>

<p>Also, I have a hard stop Friday afternoon because of having company over
for Ogre on Saturday. It really should not be a problem to to get very
close to a complete game in.</p>

<p>It occurs to me I don't actually understand what the Japanese are
intending to accomplish here, possibly it's an attempt to take Imphal.</p>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Weather determination (2.3, probably on map)</li>
  <li>First player determination, roll d6 highest has initiative, reroll for
tie (2.3).</li>
</ul>

<p>Weather roll is 23, clear and normal.</p>

<p>Rules call for Japanese to have first move.</p>

<h3 id="japanese-turn-1">Japanese Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Japanese goal this turn.</p>

<p>The Japanese goal this turn is to figure out what the Japanese are
actually intending to accomplish.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>No air for Japanese this scenario.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>None for Japanese.</p>

<h4 id="movement">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Breakout segment  (12.8e) Check trace to friendly units in supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nothing to break out.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>All units close into the Allied column as much as possible. The Youtube
video I'm watching shows the Japanese moving the cut supply from the
Allied column, but this incorrect according to how my rules dictate the
setup.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>No air or naval barrage capability for the Japanese. Will remove this
section on the next game turn.</p>

<h4 id="trace-supply">Trace Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Trace Supply phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Determine which units are in or out of Trace Supply (12.6)</li>
  <li>Replenish low or exhausted internal stocks (12.10)</li>

<p>All units can be in some sort of supply. Here's a spiffy table

<p>Not bad.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">It does not deal with the "On Map" supply provided by "S" and "T"
counters.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase">Reaction phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Non-phasing player releases Reserves (5.7), destroy dumps (12.11).</li>
  <li>Non-phasing player barrage (all types, 10.0) and transport.</li>
</ol>

<p>Allies choose to Air Barrage in two places:</p>

<ol>
  <li>B.4.27 with 28 barrage points, and</li>
  <li>B.4.22 with 24 barrage points.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="b427">B.4.27</h5>

<p>28 points against a stack of 3 Japanese units in Extremely Close terrain
(Mountain with Track), which is 2 shifts left on the barrage table. Flak
roll is 5, no effect. Barrage roll is on 12-16 column, roll 6 for DG.</p>

<h5 id="b422">B.4.22</h5>

<p>21 points against stack of 3, shift 1 left for Very Close (Mountain hex
with a road). Flak roll is 5 for no effect. Barrage proceeds on column
12-16, roll 6 for DG.</p>

<p>Bummer about the north stack. The south stack is 2 arty units, which
isn't so bad. I can still attack with remaining units.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase">Combat phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Artillery barrage (10.1, no Air/Naval)</li>
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>
</ol>

<p>Not going to do any artillery this turn.</p>

<p>Combat against 1 WY 17 Ind in B.3.24, 7 Japanese AF against 2 Indian
DF for 4:1 in Very Close terrain. Since two of the Japanese are
attacking across a minor river, their AF is halved, so it's 5:2 which is
3:1. Japanese AR 5 against Indian AR  3, roll surprise 5 + 2 for 7 no
surprise either way.</p>

<p>Pay 4T for 4 units to fight, roll 9 + 2 for 11 on 3:1 in Very Close
yields <code>Ao1/DL1o1</code>. Japanese 33 Eng and 2-213-33 retreat to b.4.22,
1 WY is eliminated. Good roll for the Japanese. An Advance After
Combat (9.12g) cuts off the 4-12FF, will let that die off from
being out of supply.</p>

<h4 id="exploitation-phase">Exploitation phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Exploitation mode is defined in Section 5.9, with Exploition Phase
details defined in Section 11.0.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0), overruns cost 3 MP (8.1a, 8.1e prohibits
Exploitation result).</li>
  <li>Barrage segment</li>
  <li>Combat segment</li>
</ol>

<p>No exploitation this turn. The 1-214-33 which was in reserve in B.4.27
was DG and cannot go into Exploitation movement (5.10b (C): <em>DG mode units
are unable to overrun or earn Exploitation Mode</em>).</p>

<h4 id="japanese-clean-up-phase">Japanese clean Up phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">

<h3 id="allies-turn-1">Allies Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allies goal this turn.</p>

<p>Now that I've had time to take a better look at the situation on the
map, the Allies are in a hard spot. They have 1 Mule, and 5 SPs, and
pretty much no place to run, being nearly trapped with a 6 SP at Tiddim.
They're best bet is probably to try to bolt as fast as possible towards
Imphal and hope to stay in Trace Supply.</p>

<p>However, I don't think this can be done on the first turn, will need to
wait a turn to pull in more supplies, and use up the big dump trapped at
Tiddim. The mules can get an SP out per turn, EZOC permitting, allowing
the big dump to get drawn down a little while reinforcements come down
from Imphal.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-1">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>Refitting doesn't cost anything for Allies in this scenario.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-1">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>Reinforcements are already on the map, with a specified number of MPs
already spent. There won't be any further reinforcements this game.</p>

<h4 id="movement-1">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Breakout segment  (12.8e) Check trace to friendly units in supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>4-12FF needs to try a Breakout: roll 5, return in 2 turns March 22,
1944.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>First up is to move the artillery unit out of danger while there is ZOC
negation. This requires fueling.</p>

<p>Next, all the reinforcements move down from Imphal.</p>

<p>Then some rearrangement to put pieces in the right place to prevent easy
Japanese takeovers.</p>

<p>Here's the situation after the Allies move:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ocs-burma/g1-t1-allies-moved.jpg" alt="After Allies first movement" /></p>

<p>Note that 4-12FF is shown in its pre-Breakout location. It will return
as a Reinforcement March 22, 1944. This is super lucky for the Allies,
otherwise this would have gone into the Dead Pile, and there is no
rebuilding replacements in this scenario.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's fire up the planes again, do more aerial barraging. Would be
great to get some DG, then attack to cripple the Japanese effort.</p>

<h5 id="b324">B.3.24</h5>

<p>First up is handling these units threatening the supply dump. Let's send
28 Barrage points at these two units.
Flak roll 11 &amp; 4, that's bad news for the Allies: Super lucky! Hurricane
II was in the affected position and only lost 1 point. For barrage,
roll 4 on 12-16 column, no effect, bummer. Note that this is a single
RE as it's 2 companies. The other modifier is a 1 shift left for Very Close
being on a road.</p>

<h5 id="b427-1">B.4.27</h5>

<p>Next apply 21 barrage points stack of three units, which are going to
get a shift left 2 due to being on a track instead of a road. First,
flak roll 5, no effect. Barrage roll 7 on 8-11 table, DG.</p>

<h4 id="trace-supply-1">Trace Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">This phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Determine which units are in or out of Trace Supply (12.6)</li>

</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">It does not deal with the "On Map" supply provided by "S" and "T"

<p>All Allied units are in Trace Supply.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-1">Reaction phase</h4>

  <li>Non-phasing player releases Reserves, etc.</li>
  <li>Non-phasing player barrage</li>

Reserve marker.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-1">Combat phase</h4>

  <li>Artillery (no Air/Naval)</li>
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>

<p>Allies are going to risk it, attacking the stack at B.4.27.</p>

<h5 id="cav--63-17-ind-vs-12-214-33--1-33-33">7 Cav &amp; 63-17 Ind vs. 1,2-214-33 &amp; 1-33-33</h5>

<p>Attacker with 8, defender with 2.5, which is 3.2:1 rounding
to 3:1 in Extremely Close terrain. This is probably a really bad idea
for the Allies, but in any case there is a good chance it will
decide the game.</p>

<p>Surprise roll 4 &amp; 5, which is defender surprise with 5 shifts left!
Noooooooo! Combat roll 9 for <code>AL1o1/Do1</code>. Bummer! 7 Cav is out! 63-17
retreats up the road 1 hex.</p>

<p>Not looking good for the Commonwealth. Lose 1 more and it's a draw.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-1">End of Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly recap the turn for both sides.</p>

<p>OCS, always good for some surprises!</p>

<p>The game isn't decided yet, at least as far as I can tell. A better
player may have a different opinion, but I'm thinking I can get either
side to win even as it stands right now. We'll see what happens.</p>

<h3 id="allies-turn-2">Allies Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allies goal this turn.</p>

<p>After the previous engagement, the Allies are more than happy to bug
out. It may be just fine, since the Japanese were pushed back in the
north, there is no EZOC to deal with, and the Allies might be able to
just haul ass (as it were), beat feet, take a powder, vamoose, and
otherwise make themselves scarce on in the general area of Tiddim.</p>

<p>The big challenge is to <em>resist</em> take a potshot at the Japanese on the
way out. Much easier to just defend, let them take losses at low odds
in rough terrain.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-2">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p>All aircraft refitted and ready for missions.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-2">Reinforcement</h4>

<p>No reinforcements this turn.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>

<p>Allies have no spotters where any barrages would be effective,
would be too many shifts left without spotters.</p>

<p>Air is going to hold until Reaction phase of upcoming Japanese turn.</p>

<h3 id="japanese-turn-2">Japanese Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Japanese goal this turn.</p>

<p>In short, the Japanese need to eliminate 2 more to
get a win. This might be easy, it might be hard. In either
case, it's going to take very close tracking of supplies to
get them where they need to be.</p>

<h4 id="movement-3">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>Moving supplies and positioning for combat next turn. Not enough SP
within throw to make combat worthwhile.</p>

<p>The general notion is to take a good solid swipe at the Allies as they
consolidate before bugging out. With a little luck, the Japanese will
get the double turn. They will be well-positioned for it.</p>

<h4 id="trace-supply-3">Trace Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">This phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Determine which units are in or out of Trace Supply (12.6)</li>
  <li>Replenish low or exhausted internal stocks (12.10)</li>
</ul>

<p>All in Trace Supply.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-3">Reaction phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Non-phasing player releases Reserves (5.7), destroy dumps (12.11).</li>
  <li>Non-phasing player barrage (all types, 10.0) and transport.</li>
</ol>

<p>Air barrage on the buildup at Tiddim, will use high bombardment from two
airbases for the flight, will be nasty for the Japanese if the air
barrage works.</p>

<p>Barraging with 40 points on B.3.24. Flak roll 7 for no effect.
Roll 8 - 1 left for Very Close terrain for 7, which is column 17-24
and a <code>DG</code> result. Bummer for Japanese. They're going to attack anyway
on next turn, because this is their turn, so the DG marker is coming
off. It was a wasted air barrage given the Japanese aren't going to
attack, but the Allies don't really know that, so, not a waste given
free air for Allies.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-3">Combat phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Artillery barrage (10.1, no Air/Naval)</li>
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>
</ol>

<p>Japanese passing on Combat this turn.</p>

<h4 id="japanese-clean-up-phase-1">Japanese clean Up phase</h4>

<p>DG markers come off. Now to get that double roll for the Japanese on
next turn.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-2">End of Turn 2</h3>

<p>The Allies decided not to cut and run, it would have been high risk
at least one more unit eliminated. Holding for one more turn should
allow for a better retreat, lower risk as more units come forward
to help support the retreat.</p>

<p>The Japanese just didn't have enough supply to do any decent combat
for two successive turns, so they decided to wait one more turn to bring
up enough supply to put full weight on the Allied tail draggers. If they
get the initiative next turn, there is a good chance they can take out
another Allied unit.</p>

<p>Here's the game state for the end of Turn 2.</p>

<p>Turn sequence:</p>

<p>Note: these are spread out to allow setting up later. The game had to be
boxed up for a few days to allow other activities to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="game-turn-3">Game Turn 3</h2>

<p>The Allies are almost in a bind, but the Japanese are pretty far out on
their supply chain as well. The Japanese would like to kill two more
units for the win. The Allies need to reinforce just enough to cleanly
bail. A lot will depend on who has first player this turn.</p>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase-2">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

</ul>

<h3 id="allies-turn-3">Allies Turn 3</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allies goal this turn.</p>

<p>The Allies are going to move all units as far as they can using up as

with as much supply as will allow defending and next turn movement.</p>

<p>At the start of the turn, the Allies can draw on 5 SPs, with another

<p>Barrage with 42, draw 6T, roll <code>10-6</code> which means

the Japanese attack, but that's ok. Should still have enough T to
defend.</p>

<h3 id="japanese-turn-3">Japanese Turn 3</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Japanese goal this turn.</p>

<p>Setting this up on Christmas Day 2019, 6 some odd months after starting
the game, I'm not really clear on what to do next. At the moment of this
writing, I have the counters on the map, but that's it. Next steps, in
order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>(DONE) Dig out the OCS rules, the Burma rules, and the player aids.</li>
  <li>Reread the session report to determine what has actually transpired
up to now.</li>
  <li>Determine how long I want to play this thing today, and develop some
ending criteria.</li>
  <li>Make a plan for the upcoming Japanese turn.</li>
  <li>Get more of the rules in to Anki (ongoing during game play).</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this is extra difficult as my eyes are really sore and I'm having
a hard time focusing on the screen.</p>

<p>[2019-12-18] And nothing happened on Christmas Day, I got distracted by other things.
What I've decided the Japanese will do is go all out attack and see if
they can destroy another step of CW units, which I believe will result
in a draw. Then I might just put it away. We'll see at that time.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-4">Aircraft refit</h4>

  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a Mud condition turn, which is going to have effects on
movement, worst effect on the trucks. Nevertheless, the Japanese are
taking advantage of the OCS rounding rule, and moving 2 hexes for a 1.5
MF. Focus is on CW unit in hex B2.27. (<em>This is wrong for movement,
recall trucks count half points, which is what should have been done
here as well. It didn't matter for this turn, but having a single unit
1 hex further than it would normally be could matter a lot in future
turns</em>.)</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="trace-supply-5">Trace Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">This phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Determine which units are in or out of Trace Supply (12.6)</li>
  <li>Replenish low or exhausted internal stocks (12.10)</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">It does not deal with the "On Map" supply provided by "S" and "T"
counters.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-5">Reaction phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Non-phasing player releases Reserves, etc.</li>
  <li>Non-phasing player barrage</li>
</ol>

<p>Huge mistake here from the CW side: they should have put all the
artillery in Reserve so it could be used here in reaction phase to
disrupt the oncoming Japanese. No reaction!</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-5">Combat phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Artillery (no Air/Naval)</li>
</ol>

<p>The Japanese have one puny battery of strength 3, but it's going to try
and get lucky, there is enough supply. Just enough, and that's blowing
the wad on this turn.</p>

<p>Spend 2T for 3-33, roll 7/1, which is no effect for barrage.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>
</ol>

<p>Japanese 33 Eng leads with Morale 5, CW 7-10 leads with Morale 4, roll
for surprise: 8 + 1 for no surprise.</p>

<p>Odds are 10:9, rolling on 1-1 for very close…roll 6 + 1 (Action rating
difference) for 7, which is <code>AL1o1Do1</code>. 33 Eng is kaput, will take
another step loss as will be getting a stack of units back from DG at
the end of the turn, 3-215 chooses to stand and die. This forces the CW
to choose a retreat or a step loss. Obviously, a retreat is in order,
but every retreatable hex is in a Japanese ZOC, so they retreat up the
road and stack with another unit, and the whole stack goes DG. Which is
not a bad thing for the Japanese, although it probably won't matter.</p>

<h4 id="exploitation-phase-4">Exploitation phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">

<p>Remove DG markers.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-3">End of Turn 3</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly recap the turn for both sides.</p>

<p>The Japanese made a worthy attempt, but if the CW gets away on the next
turn, it's game over with a CW win. The Japanese needed to get a CW
step loss here to get the draw. Let's see what happens next. Maybe the
Japanese will get the initiative. But can they get enough supplies to
make that matter?</p>

<h2 id="game-turn-4">Game Turn 4</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the upcoming turn for both sides.</p>

<p>In a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The CW needs to bolt down the road as fast as possible to out run the
Japanese ability to supply.</li>
  <li>The Japanese need to get the initiative and hammer the CW while it's
DG, supply permitting.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase-3">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>
    <p>Weather determination (2.3, probably on map)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Weather roll 5/4, Light Rain this turn.</li>
  <li>Mud last turn with Light Rain this turn is Mud again.</li>
  <li>Air Operations roll 1, Unrestricted with Light Rain. This is
super good for CW.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>First player determination, roll d6 highest has initiative, reroll for
tie (2.3).</li>
</ul>

<p>Roll:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CW: 3.</li>
  <li>Japanese: 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>CW has the initiative. Bummer for Japanese.</p>

<h3 id="commonweath-turn-4">Commonweath Turn 4</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Commonweath goal this turn.</p>

<p>Succinctly, getting as far away from the Japanese as possible,
hopefully out past their ability to supply themselves. Should
be doable.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-5">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>All aircraft are active.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-5">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<h4 id="movement-6">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Breakout segment  (12.8e) Check trace to friendly units in supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>None.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>Time to read up on DG movement in rules. MP is 1/2 when in DG mode.
Since we're in Mud, that's going to slow down the retrograde motion
considerably for the DG units. I can move stacked DG units
independently, the rules imply each "dropped off" unit remains in DG
mode. I'll need to fish out some markers.</p>

<p>First thing is to bring up some supply points to fuel the motorized
units. Then move everything.</p>

<p>It's clear after moving that even with half movement points, and
trailing unit being DG, that the Japanese cannot move nearly enough
combat strength to make a difference. It would be combat on the 1:3
column, and would need to roll boxcars with a +3 DRM, which just isn't
there, best is +1 DRM.</p>

<p>So that's the game after all. Here's what it looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ocs-burma/g1-end.jpg" alt="OCS Burma game 1 end" /></p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Overall I'm happy with the game. It's nice to sit back down with OCS
again. I'm not happy it took me 6 months to finish the game, with what
ended up being a single turn of play to finish. But that's how it goes,
career is first these days.</p>

<h3 id="some-questions">Some questions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose a stack with a reserve marker is rendered DG during Reaction
  Barrage Segment. The way the rules read this renders the Reserve unit(s)
  unable to move in Exploitation Phase. The ambiguity concerns the word
  "earn Exploitation Mode" in 5.10b (C), to wit, the Reserve markers are
  placed rather than "earned." I'm playing that the DG renders the Reserve
  movement in Exploitation Phase null, but I can see it either way: a unit
  in Reserve might be better prepared to weather what would otherwise be
  the effects of DG.</p>

    <p>Restating: does a DG result from reaction remove the ability of a
 unit in Reserve to proceed during Exploitation Phase?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a 3 MP is halved to 1.5, is that rounded up to 2? I think it is
not, as trucks moving supply track half points as well. So I played it
wrong on Japanese turn 3.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
