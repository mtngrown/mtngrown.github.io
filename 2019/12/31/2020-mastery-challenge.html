2020 Mastery Challenge
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 31 2019</time>
<p>It's once again time to contemplate mastery during 2020. Due to career
commitments, the only goal for 2020 is to not have a goal. Career goals
are paramount, and very time consuming. For 2020, game play needs to
simply be a casual diversion rather than a serious hobby. I will keep
track of H-index scoring, which is easy enough.</p>

<p>Here are the challenges from 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/2018/12/31/2019-mastery-challenge.html">2019 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/12/31/2018-mastery-challenge.html">2018 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2016/12/31/2017-mastery-challenge.html">2017 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2015/12/31/2016-challenge.html">2016 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2020-12-31</strong>: Current average plays for count of owned games: <code>925 / 117 = 7.90</code>.</p>

<h3 id="november-9-2020">November 9, 2020</h3>

<p>This will likely be my last update for 2020, until my annual Mastery
challenge article on December 31.</p>

<p>Lacking any other place to put them, here are some LotR house rules
for Ranged and Sentinel for single hand solo, drawn from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrlcg/comments/jpvjjm/house_rules_discussion/gbhw7l9/">post on
Reddit</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Exclude Gandalf from the following.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pay one matching resource for a character with Sentinel to defend
without exhausting, limit once per round.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Ranged character may exhaust to deal 1 damage to an enemy in
the staging area, limit once per round.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Ranged character may exhaust to attack an ALREADY engaged enemy
first, limit once per round.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More actual thoughts shortly.</p>

<p>Shortly after I wrote the June update, the whole country went nuts over
police brutality, with a lot of racial tension in the air. Since I live
in a somewhat mixed neighborhood, and close to a rough neighborhood, I
stopped walking in the mornings as I no longer felt safe. There were a
lot of marches, including some running up San Pablo. Pretty weird.</p>

<p>I did get 100 plays of Absolutely Aces recorded, that's going to be the
highlight of the year, considering I have 3 other titles (Sorcerer, OCS
Burma, First Team: Vietnam) I have not yet finished. I do a turn or two,
then put them away and start a new game.  Not good. I need to finish
things I start, not indulge a habit of starting things and not finishing
them. I'd like to close out 2020 finishing First Team: Vietnam,
Sorceror, Lotr "We Must Away Ere Break of Day" first Hobbit quest,
and OCS Burma. That doesn't seem like much, but it's actually a lot of
time considering my work load and energy level.</p>

<h3 id="june-13-2020">June 13, 2020</h3>

<p>Lockdown more or less continues. I'm personally mostly staying home,
venturing out for a morning walk and getting groceries once a week.
Meanwhile the news media is telling us the country is melting down.
I think there is truth in that, but I also believe the media is both
aiding and abetting it, and percieves itself benefitting from the
meltdown. So I mostly avoid reading the news.</p>

<p>But all that is stupid, this is about games.</p>

<p>It turns out not commuting leaves me with more time and energy to
squeeze a game in now and then. Over the last few weeks, I've been able
to get solo games of Absolutely Aces in most every evening. The game
plays very quickly, less than an hour even if I record every move.
I've 54 plays at the time of this writing. I do not know how many total
plays I want to rack up before moving on, but I'm thinking maybe 100.
At my current rate, that would wrap it up around the end of July.
After that I'm planning to do the same thing with a different game,
but I haven't chosen one yet.</p>

<h3 id="april-26-2020">April 26, 2020</h3>

<p>We've now been on "lockdown," for 6 weeks. Lockdown being a euphimism
for house arrest. It's not quite that bad, I could spend a lot of time
out and about provided I had a plausible excuse for being out of the
house. I am <em>not</em> happy about it from a theoretical point of view, but
I do very much like <em>not</em> commuting!</p>

<p>In any case, I'm trying to do a bit better at getting a game in once a
week. Not always succeeding, but gradually doing better than earlier in
the year.</p>

<h3 id="march-22-2020">March 22, 2020</h3>

<p>Here we are in March, in complete lockdown in California, which changes
the game situation considerably. It now makes sense to get a 2020
Mastery Challenge scoped out. It turns out working from home all the
time means it's really hard for me to shut it off, it's all work all the
time, except on weekends, where I end up having so many projects in
flight I can't decide what to work on.</p>

<p>Two games I think I do want to play next are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora, and</li>
  <li>Tobruk.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both these are classics. I've had Tobruk out and set up in the past,
probably before I got serious about logging plays. It's also a game that
I purchased in my very early teens, and did not play at that time.</p>

<p>I could also shoot for 900 plays for 2020. That's not so hard when Lord
of the Rings LCG is in rotation.</p>

<p>H-index is another target, I'm almost at 14.</p>

<p>Or move the average plays from 7 to 6, which would be 25 new games if I
did not replay anything at all, even more if I did.</p>

<h3 id="h-index">H-index</h3>

<p>Much of the rationale is identical to 2019: will mostly play LotR LCG
almost surely. H-index 14 will be a by-product.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>143/116</code> <strong>Lord of the Rings LCG</strong> will almost surely remain my
most-played game in 2020. It's fairly easy to get to the table, has a
reasonably short time window for playing (1-3 hours), and it's fun.
If I were to have a goal in 2020, it might be to get all the way through
the Heirs of Numenor cycle, sweeping up the Hobbit boxes and print on
demand scenarios compatible with progression style play. Since I'm
stuck on Shadow and Flame in Dwarrowdelf at the moment, that might be a
lot to ask for. We'll see how it goes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>101/5</code> <strong>Absolutely Aces</strong> is a tiny card game, with maximum 10
cards total in play at any one time. It is played in rounds, which
makes it a no-brainer to set up while doing chores. I expect to play
quite a bit of it in 2020.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>63/63</code> <strong>Hive</strong> No plans to play Hive in 2020. Too engrossing and
I cannot bear to play it badly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>44/44</code> <strong>Ogre</strong> The G3 and S3 maps are now in my house. Ogre will
definitely get more play in 2020.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>31/31</code> <strong>Zombie Dice</strong> May catch a few games here and there, I
usually pack it along when I go to other places to play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>PanzerBlitz</strong> Nothing planned for 2020.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>26/24</code> <strong>Star Realms</strong> should see a few plays in 2020.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>21/20</code> <strong>Race for the Galaxy</strong> is always good for a few random plays
here and there. If I end up getting sick in bed (doesn't happen often),
this would something I'd play online during that time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20/20</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong> Remains casualty of losing the local
game store venue. Might set up a long running campaign.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>19/19</code> <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> Had a good run with Fire in the Lake
in 2018, but again, it's that venue problem. We'll see what happens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>17/17</code> <strong>6 Nimmt!</strong> will reserve plays for 3 or more people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Cathedral</strong> is a solved game, and I don't have a copy, and
the copyright holder is quite restrictive on distribution. If I find
a copy for a buck or two I'll pick it up and learn the solution.
Otherwise no plans on playing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>14/12</code> <strong>Battle for Moscow</strong> I still haven't really cracked this
game in the same way I cracked Target Leningrad. Would be worth playing
a few times to really see how to win it as the Germans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/13</code> <strong>Ogre: Objective 218</strong> Will likely set this up to play
between chores, although that didn't happen in 2019.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/13</code> <strong>Vietnam Solitaire</strong> Time to start using the Special
Edition Rules. Most of the time I play using standard rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Hapsburg Eclipse</strong> Good chance this will get back into
rotation this year. I think I've playing it wrong for a long time,
and I want to try out some new strategies. This is another game which
fits well in between chores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Objective Kiev</strong> I've cracked the German side, now to
figure out how to win as the Soviets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Pandemic</strong> My usual partner for this game is no longer
a gaming opponent or partner. If I play it in 2020, it will be
with the In The Lab expansion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Soviet Dawn</strong> Time to revisit for a few plays, didn't get
around to it in 2019.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>StarForce</strong> Would like to play the solitaire situation
several more times, at different locations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Target Leningrad</strong> probably won't see a play in 2019, would
prefer to bring The Arduous Beginning into rotation, which only has
three plays at the moment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>Leaving Earth</strong> Will almost surely get played. I
really like the game, I can set it up and leave it for a period
of time, and it's easy to document play via spreadsheet. Also, I have
not yet played the Stations Expansion, which seems like an obvious
thing to do this year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Flash Point</strong> I almost always play this solo, it's
something good for chores days. Really ought to get this out in 2020.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/9</code> <strong>OCS</strong> May set up the Kasserine scenario in Tunisia II, or
take another crack at Operation Compass in DAK2. We'll see. I'm
heartened by getting a Burma game in during 2019. As it turned out,
I did get a Burma game in, but that was it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong> Probably won't play this year as it's pretty
involved and there are other things I want to do instead. I do have an
interest in developing smaller scenarios for the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>6/6</code> <strong>Android:Netrunner</strong> should move up in the ranks pretty fast
as I now have a regular opponent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>4/0</code> <strong>High Frontier 4 All</strong> is now on this list as it arrived
late in the year, and I'm super stoked to be playing it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>1/1</code> <strong>Other COIN</strong> This is COIN other than Fire in the Lake.
Would like to get a play of Cuba Libre in this year.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wargame-specific-h-index">Wargame-specific H-index</h3>

<p>My wargame-specific H-index started 2019 at 10.  Wargames are so much
more time consuming that this index will increase much, much more slowly
than the overall H-index. I do not expect much progress on this list
in 2020.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>44</code> Ogre</li>
  <li><code>27</code> PanzerBlitz</li>
  <li><code>20</code> Silver Bayonet</li>
  <li><code>19</code> Fire in the Lake</li>
  <li><code>13</code> Battle for Moscow</li>
  <li><code>13</code> Vietnam Solitaire</li>
  <li><code>12</code> Objective Kiev</li>
  <li><code>12</code> Soviet Dawn</li>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
