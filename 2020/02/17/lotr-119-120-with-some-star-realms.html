Lotr 119, 120, 121 with some Star Realms
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 17 2020</time>
<p>Friend from work stopped by to throw some cards around. The original
intent was to play a round of Lord of the Rings LCG, which went so well
we played another couple of rounds, followed up with some Colony Wars.</p>

<p>All in all a pretty good time, would really like to play more, but work
is just so brutal.</p>

<h2 id="lord-of-the-rings-lcg">Lord of the Rings LCG</h2>

<p>These quests were played with a pair of deck in the <a href="https://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/8185">Eowyn and the
Odd Fellows</a> Fellowship.
Very standard Single Core decks with Leadership/Lore and Tactics/Spirit.
Still fun to play!</p>

<p>In all of the following, I took the Leadership/Lore deck <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14515/anoblecoreridesforth-1.0">A Noble Core Rides
Forth</a>,
with colleague JL taking <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14516/anoblecorequestsforafight-1.0">A Noble Core Quests for a
Fight</a>.</p>

<h3 id="game-119-passage-through-mirkwood-28">Game 119: Passage Through Mirkwood (28)</h3>

<p>This was a pretty easy win. We kept everything pretty well under
control, the threat pretty well down, and ended up on Beorn's Path
for the final stage, which was easy by then.</p>

<p>Since this went so fast, we dealt out Journey Along the Anduin to try
our luck with the Hill Trolls.</p>

<h3 id="game-120-journey-along-the-anduin-9">Game 120: Journey along the Anduin (9)</h3>

<p>This turned out to be a very fast game, Eowyn went out on round 2 or 3,
so we scooped it and tried again.</p>

<h3 id="game-121-journey-along-the-anduin-10">Game 121: Journey along the Anduin (10)</h3>

<p>Our second game of Journey Along the Anduin got off to a much better
start, with the Hill Troll snared very early in the game. We rolled
along pretty well for several turns, then the threat got above 35 and we
pull an Evil Storm, which killed a Gimli and Legolas, which had been
suffering from a pair of Goblin Snipers in the staging area.</p>

<p>Since we were otherwise doing pretty well, we decided to AU (alternate
universe) the game and continue on to complete it.</p>

<p>The second hill troll was second from the bottom of the deck.</p>

<h4 id="an-aar">An AAR</h4>

<p>We came up against an interesting situation with respect to Goblin
Snipers. The wording on the cards seems clear enough, but the intent
is not. The notion is that the Staging Area must be clear before the
Goblin Sniper can be optionally engaged.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose there is one Goblin Sniper and one Dol Guldur Beastmaster.
During the optional engagement phase, the first player engages the
Dol Guldur Beastmaster. Can the second player then optionally engage
Goblin Sniper?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose there are two Goblin Snipers with no other enemies in the
Staging Area. Can these be engaged by the first and second player?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="star-realms-colony-wars">Star Realms Colony Wars</h2>

<p>Star Realms is always a favorite for closing out the day. I found out
after I got hammered twice that opponent used to play the iPhone app on
the train daily for months. Looks like that's something I might want to
try!</p>

<h4 id="game-24">Game 24</h4>

<p>I lost this one not too badly. Didn't build the economy up enough. Got
the opponent down to one hit point remaining, but their next hand they
had Authority recapture a bunch and it was curtains for me after that.</p>

<h4 id="game-25">Game 25</h4>

<p>Lost this one really badly. I've been trying to do super aggro fast
damage, but opponent has been building out economy and authority cards.
I do well at the beginning, but really stumble at the end.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
