LotR 122 - We Must Away, Ere Break of Day (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 22 2020</time>
<p>Trying out a new deck, <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/185887">A Hobbit Goes Adventuring
(v0.4)</a>. Pretty sure it will need
some adjustment, possibly major adjustment, since I've never played any
of The Hobbit scenarios.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Erebor Battle Master</li>
  <li>Foe-Hammer</li>
  <li>Quick Strike</li>
  <li>Veteran Axehand</li>
  <li>Quick Strike</li>
</ul>

<p>Encounter: A Suspcious Crow</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Dwarrowdelf Axe.</li>
  <li>Planning: Veteran Axehand, Threat 28.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Bilbo, draw Lots or None at All, no Trolls so
Doomed 2 for Threat 30. Net 1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: A Suspicious Crow</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, shadow Lots or None at All for no effect.
Veteran Axehand kills it.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Dwarrowdelf Axe.</li>
  <li>Planning: Dwarrowdelf Axe on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin and Bilbo, draw Lots or None at All. Too weird,
I am going to shuffle the encounter deck. Threat 33, net +2
Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Dwarven Tomb.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin and Bilbo, draw Wind-Whipped Rain, Dwarrowdelf Axe is
discarded. Bummer. Net +2 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor Battle Master, Threat 34.</li>
  <li>Quest: Nori, Thalin, Bilbo, draw Hobbit Lands. Net +3
Progress to clear stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: Hobbit Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Bert and Tom.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends Tom, shadow Troll Camp for no effect,
Gimli takes 3 damage. Veteran Axehand defends Bert, shadow Roast 'em
or Boil 'em to add Troll Camp to Staging Area, dead.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's the game but I'm going to play out another round to see
what happens.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Hungry Troll, now all Trolls are
in play with Threat +8 for 43, and I've had enough for now.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Some observations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Citadel Plate is really critical, Gimli could take a couple of Troll
hits with one, then rally back for the kill on a later round.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don't care about Dwarven Tomb here, need to replace it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Need more allies out earlier, need a lot of chumps. Snowborne
Scout would be ideal with 1 cost, but I don't have Leadership. Will
have to cruise the card base.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I think I'll need to either massively turtle to get the allies out,
or keep the threat super low so that only one troll engages at a time.
An interesting problem.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
