LotR 123 - We Must Away, Ere Break of Day (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 22 2020</time>
<p>Trying again with <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/185887">A Hobbit Goes Adventuring
(v0.5)</a>.
I did some card swapping to increment the version.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Veteran Axehand</li>
  <li>Dwalin</li>
  <li>Dwarrowdelf Axe</li>
  <li>Song of Travel</li>
  <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
  <li>Burglar Baggins</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an interesting hand.</p>

<p>Encounter: Lots or None At All, Threat 31. Bummer.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: Song of Travel on Gimli, then Unexpected Courage on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin and Bilbo, draw Wind Whipped Rain. Well, dang. I feel
scooping, this basically put me a turn behind on resources. That really
blows. Net +3 on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think perhaps I should mulligan for A Test of Will because the
Treachery cards in this scenario are brutal.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Foe-Hammer.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Veteran Axehand. Threat 31.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Bilbo draw Troll Purse. Net +3 Progess. Need to
be careful here. Maybe don't quest next time.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I could kill one of the trolls this turn, I'd bring it on.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Unexpected Courage on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, draw A Suspicious Crow which is perfect,
Thalin eliminates with a damage, there is no threat or
progress increase. I just bought a turn back.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: A need allies.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Roast 'Em or Boil 'Em, 1 damage to Veteran
Axehand. Threat 34.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 15, draw Feint. I'll need this one.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Lots or None At All, Threat 37.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'll have all 3 Trolls at once. This is not good.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 19, draw Quick Strike. Where are the Allies?</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw A Suspicious Crow, which has an implicit surge
effect on When Revealed, which I didn't play last time. Reveal
Lots or None At All. Threat 39.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: A Suspicious Crow.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, shadow Roast 'Em or Boil 'Em, Troll, cancel
with Hasty Stroke. Veteran Axehand kills the crow.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<p>I might just threat out.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 22, draw Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Hobbit Lands. Threat 41.</li>
  <li>Travel: Hobbit Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 24, draw Foe-Hammer.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, need Allies.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, draw Roast 'Em or Boil 'Em. This destroys
Veteran Axehand and Gondorian Spearman. Very bad.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 28, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: play both Stand and Fights to put Veteran Axehand
and Gondorian Spearman back into play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, draw Lone Lands. Threat 45.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 46.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 28, draw Quick Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Gimli, Nori, draw Wind-Whipped Rain which removes
Unexpected Courage from Gimli. Net +2 Progress which clears Hobbit
Lands (draw Citadel Plate), and completes stage 1. Calling it here.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
