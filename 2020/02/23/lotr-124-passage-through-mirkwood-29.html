LotR 124 - Passage Through Mirkwood (29)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 23 2020</time>

<p>First play of an <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/194974">Elrond Vilya deck
(v0.3)</a>. I've been wanting to try
out some different styles of play, rather than leaning on dwarf swarms.
Given Elrond's ability to pull allies, I may still swarm, but at least
not only dwarves for this deck.</p>

<p>I don't have the confidence to start with Journey Along the Anduin,
so another spin through Mirkwood seems appropriate.</p>

<p>Initial hand (mulligan):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Light of Valinor</li>
  <li>Steward of Gondor</li>
  <li>Light of Valinor</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>Northern Tracker</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Light of Valinor on Elrond.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, draw Mountains of Mirkwood for net +2 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road and ready Eowyn.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Elrond defends, shadow King Spider exhaust Eowyn. Theodred
attacks for 1 damage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Self Preservation.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Steward of Gondor on Elrond, play Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Elrond, Northern Tracker, draw Caught in a Web,
net 5 clears Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: already engaged.</li>
  <li>Combat: Undefended, shadow Dol Guldur Orcs, cancel shadow with Hasty
Stroke. Theodred and Elrond kill Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note: I forgot to add 2 Damage to a character committed to a quest.</strong></p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Northern Tracker, Eowyn, draw Mountains of Mirkwood
for net +4 clearing stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Imladris Stargazer.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Imladris StarGazer; exhaust Imladris Stargazer to
order Vilya, A Test of Will, Unexpected Courage, Stand and Fight, Sneak
Attack. Would have liked some allies, but whatever.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, Northern Tracker, draw Dol Guldur Beastmaster.
Stage 2 cleared, Beorn's Path drawn for Stage 3.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>I should have put Unexpected Courage as second, instead of A Test of
Will. That way I could have played it immediately on Elrond, then
refreshed him for the quest phase. Next time.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Vilya.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, Northern Tracker, draw Chieftain Ufthak for
net +2 Progess. I need threat reduction.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Guldur Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Combat: Elrond defends, shadow Necromancer's Reach for no effect
and no damage on Elrond. Sneak Attack Gandalf for 4 damage, then
Gandalf attacks to kill.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>Retcon: Dol Guldur Beastmaster draws two shadow cards, the second of
which would have been Necromancer's Reach. Let's play it through.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, Northern Tracker, draw Necromancer's Reach.
I'll take the damage and save the A Test of Will for later. But let's
work the retcon above, and actually draw Great Forest Web, for net +4
Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Chieftain Ufthak.</li>
  <li>Combat: Elrond defends, shadow Old Forest Road for no effect,
no hits on Elrond. Sneak Attack Gandalf to do 4 damage, Gandalf and
Theodred attack to kill Chieftain Ufthak.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 17, draw Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Unexpected Courage on Elrond.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, Northern Tracker, draw Dol Guldur Orcs;
deal 2 Damage to Elrond. Net +4 Progress to win the game here.</li>
  <li>Travel:</li>
  <li>Encounter:</li>
  <li>Combat:</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Need to add The Galadhrim's Greetings to the sideboard.</li>
  <li>I forgot the 2 Damage dealt on the first draw of Dol Guldur Orcs. It
would not have mattered much as I had Self Preservation in my hand, and
plenty of resources to play it on Elrond.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
