Avalon Hill's Tobruk
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 11 2020</time>
<p>This is the start of playing enough new games to get my games played
average down to 6 (from 7). Tobruk is also a game I first purchased as a
young teenager, but never played.</p>

<p>Germans move first.</p>

<p>CW fires first.</p>

<p>Weapons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grant:
    <ul>
      <li>75mm M2</li>
      <li>37mm M6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pz-IIIh:
    <ul>
      <li>50mm Short</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pz-IIIj:
    <ul>
      <li>50mm Long</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pz-IVe:
    <ul>
      <li>75mm Short</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the setup and the German entry hexes:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/tobruk/g1-setup.jpg" alt="Tobruk gam1 setup" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Let's all rush at each other:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/tobruk/g1-t1-movement.jpg" alt="After first turn movement" /></p>

<p>For combat:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 2 fires at Pz-IIIh 13, hit Lower Hull, scores a K-kill.
Score: CW 2, Axis 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IVe 1 fires at Grant 12, miss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 3 fires on Pz-IIIh 10, hit, LH, K-kill.
Score: CW 4, Axis 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 9 fires on Grant 10, LH for K-kill.
Score: CW 4, Axis 3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 1 fires on Pz-IIIh 16 at range 8, roll 4 is a miss. 37mm fires,
roll 3 for a miss, roll 7 for a hit, LH which is a K-kill. Dang.
Score: CW 6, Axis 3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-3IIIh 11 fires on Grant 1 at range 8, roll 6 need 7 this is a miss.
Score: CW 6, Axis 3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 12 fires on Pz-IIIh 4 at range 8, roll 6 for a miss. Try the
37mm, roll 10 for a hit, roll 5 on flank for KH K-kill.
Score: CW 8, Axis 3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 12 fires on Grant 16 at range 8, roll 9 - 1 for 8 which is a
hit, roll 12 for Flank is an <code>R</code> which is a <code>K/C2</code> K-kill. Thinning the
herd on both sides.
Score: CW 8, Axis 6.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 13 to Pz-IIIh 3, range 8, roll 7 - 1 miss for the 75mm, roll 5
- 1 for the 37mm first fire which is a miss, roll 2d fire on 37mm 8
-1 which is a hit, roll 4 on Flank for no effect.
Score: CW 8, Axis 6.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 3 right back at Grant 13, range 8 roll 9 = 1 for a hit,
roll 9 for Flank LH which is a K-kill at the this range.
Score: CW 8, Axis 9.</p>

    <p>I think I have been playing this wrong with respect to facing, which is
determined by counting hexes rather than hex center to hex center. That
might render many of the above as "not kills," but I'm ok playing this
through as is. Basically, a flank is along the row of hexes between 2
and 4 oclock or 8 and 10 oclock on the target with respect to the
attacker. Above, I was using the hexsides along the 11 to 1 lines. This
puts flank shots at much longer ranges, and will surely slow down the
game! Which is fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 9 to Pz-IIIh 5 at range 6, roll 2 for 75mm, roll 9 for 73mm
first shot, roll 4 for <code>UH</code> which is no effect, roll 9 - 1 for second
37mm which is a hit, roll 6 for no effect. Score: CW 8, Axis 9.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 5 fires back at Grant 9, roll 7 for a hit, roll 3 for <code>TUR</code>
and that's no effect, because the 50mm Short does not do damage.
Interesting. From here out, the PZ-IIIh need to take longer range
flanking shots. Score: CW 8, Axis 9.</p>

    <p>This is cool, I'm seeing some interesting potential here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 9 fires at Pz-IIIh 5 range 6, roll 3 for miss, now the 37mm
roll 9 for a frontal hit, roll 6 no effect, roll again with 9 for a hit,
roll 7 for <code>TR</code> (tracks) which is an M-kill for 1 point.
Score: CW 9, Axis 9.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IVe 3 fires on Grant 14 range 7, roll 7 for a miss! This gun is
the 75mm short, which also means "short range."
Score: CW 9, Axis 9.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 5 fires at Pz-IIIj 7 range 6, 75mm roll 10/7 for <code>TR</code> which is
an M-kill (1 pt). This leaves the 37mm to take a couple of shots, which
will be at Pz-IIIh 11 range 6, roll 7/4 for <code>UH</code> which is no effect, 2d
shot from 37mm roll 11/3 for <code>TUR</code> which is K-kill for 2 points.
Score: CW 12, Axis 9.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIj 7 fires back at Grant 5 range 6, roll 7/3 for <code>TUR</code> which is
no effect on the Grant.
Score: CW 12, Axis 9.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 14 fires 75mm on Pz-IIIh 15 range 6, roll 7/9 for a hit with
no effect, fires 37mm roll 6/6 for no effect, roll  4/9 for no effect.
Score: CW 12, Axis 9.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 15 fires 50mm Short at Grant 14 range 6, roll 5/8 for a
hit on <code>TR</code> which is an M-kill for 2 points.
Score: CW 12, Axis 11.</p>

    <p>The Grants have all fired. Now just the Pzs can fire, and they only
get one shot each, so the remainder of the turn should go pretty
quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 14 to Grant 9 at range 8, roll 10/12 for <code>R</code> which results
in <code>K/(C2)=&lt;17</code>.
Score: CW 12, Axis 14.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 17 fires at Grant 5 range 8, roll 7/7 for hit with <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh on Grant 5 at range 8, roll 8/10 for <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIj on Grant 5 range 6, roll 5/3 for <code>TUR</code> and <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 1 on Grant 2 range 6, roll 6/7 for hit with <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 19 on Grant 2 range 6, roll 6/9 for hit with <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 9 on Grant 12 range 6, roll 4/9 for a miss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 18 on Grant 1, range 7, roll 3/5 for a miss.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And that is it for Turn 1.</p>

<p>Score: CW 12, Axis 14.</p>

<p>Here's the damage:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/tobruk/g1-t1-end.jpg" alt="End of turn 1" /></p>

<p>That's 5 k-kills and 2 M-kills for the CW; 4 K-kills and
1 M-kill for the Germans. The units perched on dimes are M-kills.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Wow! I really messed up! An AFV cannot move and shoot in the same turn!
That changes a lot of things about the game, and it make me want to play
it again, correctly.</p>

<p>Germans move first. Brits are going to stay put, which means they'll be
easier to hit, but they do need to fire.</p>

<p>Since the Germans moved first, the Brits get to fire first.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 1 fires on Pz-IVe 3 at range 6, roll 8/6 for <code>TR</code> which has
an M-kill result. Grant 1 fires 37mm on Pz-IIIh 15 at range 7, roll 5/10
for first shot which is a hit with effect <code>-</code>; roll 6/10 for same
result.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IVe 3 fires on Grant 1 range 6, roll 8/10 which is hit with <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 14 fires on Pz-IIIh 3 at range 7, roll 8/5 which is a hit on
<code>LH</code> for no effect <code>-</code>. The 37mm fire on Pz-IVe 1 at range 7, first roll
is 8/8 for a hit with no effect <code>-</code>. Second roll 5/8 for a hit with
effect <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 3 fires at Grant 1 range 6, roll 8/9 for no effect <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 5 on Pz-IIIj 8 at range 6, roll 8/9 for <code>-</code>. Fire 37mm at
same target first roll 10/8 for <code>-</code>, second roll 10/5 for <code>-</code>.
No scoring so far.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIj 7 fires on Grant 5 at range 6, roll 4/5 which is a hit
with no effect <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 12 on Pz-IIIh 1 range 6 roll 9/7 for <code>TR*</code> which is an
M-kill for 1 point. 37mm fires on Pz-IIIh 19 roll 9/5 which is
<code>LH</code> and <code>-</code>, second roll 3/8 which is a miss.
Score: CW 13, Axis 14.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 1 on Grant 12 range 6, roll 4/3 which is a hit, which
is <code>TUR</code> for <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 2 on Pz-IIIh 12 range 6 roll 4/5 miss. 37mm fires at same
target first roll 5/9 for <code>-</code>, second roll 7/7 which is going to
be a <code>TR</code> hit for an M-kill. That's it for the Brits.
Score: CW 14, Axis 14.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 19 fires at Grant 12 range 6 roll 7/8 which is <code>TR</code>
for an M-kill.
Score: CW 14, Axis 15.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh on Grant 5 range 7, roll 5/10 for 5/10 for <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 12 on Grant 2 range 6 roll 11/6 for <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 8 on Grant 1 range 7 roll 9/9 for <code>-</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And that's the end of Turn 2.</p>

<p>Score: CW 14, Axis 15.</p>

<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/tobruk/g1-t2-end.jpg" alt="Turn 2 end" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Didn't get K-kills on Turn2. Turn 1 kills are a result of me not
understanding how flanking works, hence I used the flanking results
inappropriately.</p>

<p>Unless the Brits get some really lucky rolls, it looks like the Germans
are going to get some righteous flanking next turn.</p>

<p>Germans move to flank from the end of the line of tanks, Brits are going
to hold fast for now, there is no good move which doesn't expose a flank
to some fire.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 14 fires on Pz-IIIh 15 range 4 roll 9/3 for <code>TUR</code> which is
K-kill, score 2 points! And take out a flanker! 37mm first on Pz-IVe 1
roll 12/5 for <code>TR</code> which is an M-Kill (1 point), roll again let's see
what happens, 6/9 for <code>-</code>.
Score: CW 17, Axis 15.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIh 9 on Grant 12 range 6, roll 7/7 for  Flank shot which is <code>LH</code>
for K-kill and 3 points.
Score: CW 17, Axis 18. <em>This is a mistake, Pz-IIIh 9 moved this turn,
rendering it's K-kill a game play error.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grant 5 on Pz-IIIh 8 range 6 acquired so 3 rolls with the 75mm: first
roll 6/4 which is an <code>UH</code> on the Front which is <code>C2(P3)=&lt;17</code>, roll 3
for K-kill and 2 points. Now to hose down Pz-IIIh 17 range 6, roll 2/6
which is a miss, roll 4/11 which is also a miss. Bummer, that thing is
going flank about right now. Except it can't, it moved!
Score: CW 19, Axis 18.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pz-IIIj 7 on Grant 5 range 6 for 4 shots, roll 8/5 for <code>-</code>, roll
11/11 for <code>C2(P4)=&lt;2</code> roll 4 for <code>-</code>, roll 6/10 for <code>-</code>. Bummer.</p>

a K-kill at this range, 3 more points.
Score: CW 22, Axis 26.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I'm wrapping it up here, because I don't see any way the Brits are going
to pull this one out of the hat. They have no shots left this turn,
whereas the Germans have 14 shots.</p>

<p>Here's what the end of the game looked like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/tobruk/g1-end.jpg" alt="Called it in turn 4" /></p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This is a cool game. I like and I think my usual opponent will like it
as well. I'm definitely playing at least the next scenario sooner than
later. It's all infantry.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I did not keep track of acquired targets very well. I meant to, and I
attempted a few, but I managed to lose acquisition on Pz-IIIh 15 which
ended up flanking Grant 14 on Turn 2. I did better in following turns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not fire the Pz-IIIh initial twice. This is totally a mistake.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
