LotR 128 - We Must Away, Ere Break of Day (3)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 18 2020</time>
<p>Another crack with the "A Hobbit Goes Adventuring" deck. This deck isn't
published yet, I'll get around to it at some point. It's also weak on
questing I think, need to play it a few more times to see.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Burglar Baggins</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Veteran Axehand</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Feint</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think I shuffled this very well. I'm going to play it out
anyway.</p>

<p>Encounter: Hobbit Lands, nice.</p>

  <li>Planning: Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gandalf, Gimli, Thalin, Nori, Bilbo, draw Hungry Troll

Entrance and puts another P on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: Troll Camp.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>

  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

  <li>Planning: Citadel Plate on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gandalf, Gimli, Thalin, Nori, Bilbo, Dwalin, draw Dreary Hills
and I think that is going to be the game… Threat 40.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43, need to keep Gandalf in the game…</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 17, draw Citadel Plate. This is ridiculous.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: same, draw Suspicious Crow, which is eliminated by Thalin
before pulling his nasty surge tricks. Threat 44.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm calling it here, location lock.</p>

<p>This deck is too light on questing. I'm probably going to play it a
couple more times to get a good handle on the Encounter deck. I don't
think I need much more questing though.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
