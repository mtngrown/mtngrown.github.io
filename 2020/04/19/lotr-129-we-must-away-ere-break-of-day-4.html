LotR 129, 130 - We Must Away, Ere Break of Day (4, 5)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 19 2020</time>
<p>Still not sold on <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/185887">A Hobbit Goes
Adventuring</a> deck,
but it's playing a few more times to figure out what's weak.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gondorian Spearman</li>
  <li>Feint</li>
  <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
  <li>Feint</li>
  <li>Burglar Baggins</li>
  <li>Resourceful</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think I want to use Resourceful in this deck. It's super
expensive at 4, with Secrecy 3, and I'm too far from getting my
threat below 20 to matter. Getting rid of it will free up a slot.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Nori, Thalin, draw Lone-Lands for 0 net.</li>
  <li>Travel: Lone-Lands</li>
  <li>Encounter: Suspicious Crows</li>
  <li>Combat: Bilbo defends, shadow Troll Purse, no effect. Gimli kills
Suspicious Crows.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Planning: Unexpected Courage on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Thalin, Bilbo, draw Lots or None at All, Threat 32.
Net +4 clear Lone-Lands +1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Nori, Thalin, Bilbo, draw No Campfire, draw
Roast 'Em or Boil 'Em, destroy Gondorian Spearman. Bummer.
Net +6 to clear stage 1. Interesting. Add all the Trolls to
the staging area. With 33 Threat, two of them are coming out.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm scooping it here and doing some adjustment on the deck.</p>

<p>Next deck:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Replace Resourceful with another Tactics Bofur and Zigil Miner.</li>
  <li>Replace 1 Burglar Baggins with another Zigil Miner.</li>
</ul>

<p>This results in <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/185887">A Hobbit Goes
Adventuring v0.6</a> deck.
Let's play it.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Quest: All but Axehand, draw Lots or None At All, Threat 37.</li>
  <li>Travel: Hobbit Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 20, draw Kili.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Kili, Fili, Threat 36.</li>
  <li>Quest: All but Gimli and Axehand for 9 Will, draw Wind-Whipped
Rain, and that's the game because I don't have enough chumps to block.
Crap. Let's asterisk and see what happens. Draw Hungry Troll for
surge Lots Or None At All, which is Doomed 2. Actually, with Wind-Whipped Rain,
I would only be facing two Trolls on this turn, instead of 3. I got
impatient! Anyways, net +5 which clears Hobbit Lands, draw Gondorian
Spearman, and clear stage 1. All the trolls come out.</li>
  <li>Travel: Troll Camp.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Trolls. 4 sacks: Gimli, Bofur, Dwalin, Thalin. Dang.
At least Bilbo is unsacked and can remove sacks next turn.</li>
  <li>Combat: Veteran Axehand defends, shadow Hungry Troll, spend 2
resources from Bilbo to negate, Axehand is dead. Gimli takes next
two undefended: shadow More Like a Grocer which we (sadly) cannot
negate, and Dreary Hills for no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39 + 3 for 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 15, draw Foe-hammer.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gondorian Spearman, remove Gimli's sack.</li>
  <li>Quest: Nori, draw Dreary Hills, Threat 46.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Spearman defends Tom shadow A Nice Pickle, the
Spearman is no more. Fili defends William, shadow Lone-Lands for no
effect, Fili is dead. Kili defends against Bert shadow Roast 'Em Or
Boil 'Em which puts another Troll Camp in the staging area.
Gimli 12 to Bert, and 12 to Tom, getting rid of these two.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 47.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have 9 Threat in the Staging area, there is no way I can
must that amount of quest.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>There are a couple of things I could have done, such as playing Feint
to buy another turn from a Troll attack. This would have let me save
a chump, or alternatively another quest point or two. I think this deck
will do it. May need to tweak it just a little more, if I could find
another couple of useful allies which were not expensive.</p>

<p>I also had Quick Strike in hand, which means I could probably have
dispatched William before Quest phase on the following turn. Basically,
pretty much any other card and better play and I would have beat it
this time around. In fact, with Quick Strike, I would have been able to
hit William in the Action Window at the end of the Refresh Phase.
That would leave Gimli exhausted going into the next round, but
with all Trolls dead, who cares?</p>

<p>This deck can beat this quest. I'm still going to get another ally
or two in it.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
