LotR 131 - We Must Away, Ere Break of Day (6)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  9 2020</time>
<p>I'm starting this in the evening, but I'm probably not going to finish
it, too intense for a weekday. I'm using the current iteration of
<a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/185887">A Hobbit Goes Adventuring</a>.
I don't think it's a great deck for this quest, but I think I might be
able to beat the quest with it. I believe I came close the last time I
played this scenario.</p>

<p>Let's deal and get started.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Dwarrowdelf Axe</li>
  <li>Dwalin</li>
  <li>Zigil Miner</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Song of Travel</li>

  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Resource: 22, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Quest: Nori, draw Roast 'em or Boil 'em for no effect.
Progress +2 on Troll Camp.</li>

  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 25, draw Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor Battlemaster.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, draw Wind-Whipped Rain, which I'm canceling
again with A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 44.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 25, draw Foe Hammer.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>

  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 47.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 29, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gandalf, Thalin, Nori, Bilbo, draw Hungry Troll
for surge Roast 'em or Boil 'Em, no effect.</li>
  <li>Travel: Hobbit Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Trolls! Sack Thalin, Nori, Bilbo, Veteran Axehand. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Combat: here we go!
Gondorian Spearman defends Bert, Shadow Troll Camp for no effect,
Bert takes a hit, Gondorian Spearman is dead. Dwalin defends William,
shadow Cave Entrance, Dwalin is dead (for now). Gimli defends Tom,
Shadow Hungry Troll for no effect, 3 damage on Gimli.
Attacking Bert with Gandalf +4, Erebor Battlemaster +3, Zigil +1
to deal +6 damage to Bert, not enough and I'm calling the game here.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 48.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I think the next game I want to pull in the first Troll (Bert) as fast
as possible, and get him out of the way. That way I can get some damage
on Gimli right away, who can then take out Bert probably within a two
turns at that point. The problem is all the trolls get into the staging
area at once, which requires some burly questing. Also, they return to
the staging area unless threat is raised to keep them out of it.
Interesting quest!</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
