The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 23 2020</time>
<p>It's May 3, 2020, and I've been meaning to get a new, that is, new to me
game going for a couple of weeks, but just haven't had the energy to
learn a new set of rules. While my energy level is still a bit low
today, I'm feeling motivated enough to set up an unplayed game and just
go for it. The game may well stay on the table for a day or two, or a
week or two, but that's fine. This writeup will publish at some later
date.</p>

<p><em>The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora</em> is a vintage SPI title which I picked
up last year. It plays 1-5.</p>

<p>(As it turns out, the game stayed up for almost 3 weeks, but that's ok!
I got in a turn or so in the evenings, then wrapped it up on Memorial
Day weekend.)</p>

<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>

<p>Ok I need to print out a worksheet, or take notes into a table here in
the article, I could do that using markdown table generator…</p>

<p>Here's the Attribute Display:</p>

<p>We roll for Intel(ligence) and Agress(ion) attributes during Reaction as
those are the two which are needed right now.</p>

<p>For Mother, +3 DRM for Intel, roll 6 + 3 for 7 Intel, 7 + 0 for 6 Agress.
I fill in the chart above.</p>

<p>For Mary, +3 DRM for Intel, +0 for Agress, roll 7 + 10 for 8 Intel,
roll 10 + 0 for 8 Agress.</p>

<h4 id="step-two-reaction-phase">Step Two: Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>Mother reaction, roll 2, no effect.</p>

<p>Mary reaction, roll 6 for Kill attempt.</p>

<p>Roll 7 Mary Impair is 5, roll 9 - 1 Mary Shield is 6.</p>

<p>Since two enemy units are in the same space, need to roll for
Mother's stats as well. Roll 7 + 1 for 6, roll 6 + 3 for 7</p>

<p>Some combat: Mary Impair against Mother Shield is 9 - 7 = +2 roll 3 for
one hit on Mother.</p>

<p>Check for damage, roll 3 for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="step-three-acquisition-phase">Step Three: Acquisition Phase</h4>

<p>Strof grabs the WepKit. It's weight 3, Strof can Port 6, good to go.</p>

<h4 id="step-four-equipment-phase">Step Four: Equipment Phase</h4>

<p>Since the WepKit is in Damaged status, a repair attempt is made,
roll 5 for 1 level of repair, the WepKit is now in good status.</p>

<p>Strof decides to not engage in combat.</p>

<h3 id="stun-removal-phase">Stun Removal Phase</h3>

<p>No stunned units.</p>

<h3 id="cold-shutdown-phase">Cold Shutdown Phase</h3>

<p>Not yet applicable.</p>

<p>And I'm calling it for Turn 1.</p>

<p>This could be a pretty interesting game. I'm going to play several turns
this week as part of a first play, should be able to get in a turn in an
evening.</p>

<h3 id="player-turn-2">Player Turn 2</h3>

<p>This is a weekday evening turn, not sure how much of the turn I will get
through. Take it one phase at a time.</p>

<h4 id="step-one-movement-phase-1">Step One: Movement Phase</h4>

<p>Strof leaves Pod A6 for Tube A36. Exit reaction for Mother: roll 9
which is a kill attempt. No combat, Mother cannot hurt Strof, however,
Strof has a chance to damage, roll 3 for no effect.</p>

<p>Mary reacts: roll 6 for kill attempt, Strof loses 1 Shield.</p>

<p>[<strong>Note: I did not roll to see which was attacked, Mother or Mary
could have attacked each other instead of Strof.</strong>]</p>

<p>Discovery in Tube A36, roll 2, reveal Grendel and Ubot. Roll for Grendel
stats.</p>

<p>This is going to suck.</p>

<h4 id="step-two-reaction-phase-1">Step Two: Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>Roll 5 for Grendel, which is a kill attempt. Impair is 9-8, roll 2, no
effect, Damage is 5-6, roll 4 for no effect.</p>

<p>Ubot is condition red. I don't believe I can move it.</p>

<h4 id="step-three-acquisition-phase-1">Step Three: Acquisition Phase</h4>

<p>I don't see anything to acquire here.</p>

<h4 id="step-four-equipment-phase-1">Step Four: Equipment Phase</h4>

<p>Repair attempt on Ubot, succeeds to Yellow, check for berserk,
roll 4, good to go.</p>

<h3 id="stun-removal-phase-1">Stun Removal Phase</h3>

<p>Nothing stunned.</p>

<h3 id="cold-shutdown-phase-1">Cold Shutdown Phase</h3>

<p>Nothing to do here.</p>

<h3 id="player-turn-3">Player Turn 3</h3>

<p>I'm sort of getting the hang of this one, but it's slow going with a
turn (at best) after work.</p>

<p>As it turns out Strof can't leave the tube with Grendel because he's
slower than Grendel.</p>

<h4 id="step-one-movement-phase-2">Step One: Movement Phase</h4>

<p>No movement, Grendel blocks.</p>

<h4 id="step-two-reaction-phase-2">Step Two: Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>Reaction check for Grendel, roll 8, which is a kill attempt,
roll 3 on differential 1 is no effect. Damage to Grendel roll
4 on the zero column for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="step-three-acquisition-phase-2">Step Three: Acquisition Phase</h4>

<p>Pass.</p>

<h4 id="step-four-equipment-phase-2">Step Four: Equipment Phase</h4>

<p>Pass.</p>

<h3 id="stun-removal-phase-2">Stun Removal Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3 id="cold-shutdown-phase-2">Cold Shutdown Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3 id="player-turn-4">Player Turn 4</h3>

<p>I'm dialing in the MO now. One character is going to be pretty tough to
get to a win. Stats added to table above. MO Kelly lands in Pod B3.
MO Kelly has lousy stats overall. Specifically, MO Kelly has Stamina 1,
which means 1 hit and the MO is dead.</p>

<h4 id="step-one-movement-phase-3">Step One: Movement Phase</h4>

<p>Since this is MO Kelly's "first turn," a discovery check must be made.
Roll 2 for CompComm and StunBomb, the pod is Restraint 2.</p>

<p>MO Kelly scans Tube B36: Roll 4 nothing in there. [<strong>Probably a mistake,
turns proceed by phasing player. No worries for now, and that may not
apply for solitaire play.</strong>]</p>

<p>CO Strof scans Risor: Roll 6, nothing in there.</p>

<h4 id="step-two-reaction-phase-3">Step Two: Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>Grendel reacts, roll 4 which is <code>move</code>, which is lucky for Strof,
except it's actually a <code>kill</code> result when specimen is in the same
space. Since Grendel's Impair is so lame (4) against Strof's Sheild
(8), no combat occurs.</p>

<h4 id="step-three-acquisition-phase-3">Step Three: Acquisition Phase</h4>

<p>MO Kelly acquired the CompComm, StunBomb and Restraint Pod, with the
StunBomb being damaged.</p>

<p>Strof has the WepKit. Should have had MO Kelly bring the StunBomb to
Strof for repairs.</p>

<h4 id="step-four-equipment-phase-3">Step Four: Equipment Phase</h4>

<p>Repair attempt: Kelly rolls 1 for <code>D</code>, StunBomb is red. Bummer,
need to get this thing fixed, but it goes back into the pool.</p>

<p>Strof is going to attack Grendel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 4:8, roll 3 for no effect.</li>
  <li>Combat: 5:4, roll for no effect.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stun-removal-phase-3">Stun Removal Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3 id="cold-shutdown-phase-3">Cold Shutdown Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<p>Here's the situation at the end of Turn 4:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/pandora/g1_t4.jpg" alt="Turn 4 conclusion" /></p>

<p>I think I'll have Strof and Kelly do a lot of scanning the next couple
of turns.</p>

<h3 id="player-turn-5">Player Turn 5</h3>

<p>Now with 2 crew members on the map, let's do another turn.</p>

<h4 id="step-one-movement-phase-4">Step One: Movement Phase</h4>

<p>Strof scans Pod A3, roll 1 to discover Fletcher, in LandLok pod.
LandLok is an exterior lock.</p>

<p>MO Kelly moves to the empty Tube B36.</p>

<h4 id="step-two-reaction-phase-4">Step Two: Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>Roll for Fletcher stats. He's a burly. Reaction from scan is a <code>kill</code>
move, but no effect as no other unit is in that space.</p>

<h4 id="step-three-acquisition-phase-4">Step Three: Acquisition Phase</h4>

<h4 id="step-four-equipment-phase-4">Step Four: Equipment Phase</h4>

<p>Strof taking another go at Grendel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 4:8, roll 2 no effect.</li>
  <li>Combat: 5:4, roll 5 for 1 hit on Grendel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing to repair.</p>

<h3 id="stun-removal-phase-4">Stun Removal Phase</h3>

<p>Nothing stunned.</p>

<h3 id="cold-shutdown-phase-4">Cold Shutdown Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3 id="player-turn-6">Player Turn 6</h3>

<p>I'm jotting down the rules in a mind map to help get the order
of execution sorted out. Let us continue.</p>

<h4 id="step-one-movement-phase-5">Step One: Movement Phase</h4>

<p>Strof scans Tube A25, roll 4, nothing there.</p>

<p>Kelly scans Pod B6, roll 1 for Stunrod in the WepPod. Convenient.</p>

<h4 id="step-two-reaction-phase-5">Step Two: Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>Grendel rolls 7, which means <code>kill</code>, roll again to determine
target, roll 5 which is Strof.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 5:5 roll for no effect.</li>
  <li>Combat: 4:8 no combat.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="step-three-acquisition-phase-5">Step Three: Acquisition Phase</h4>

<p>Nothing to acquire.</p>

<h4 id="step-four-equipment-phase-5">Step Four: Equipment Phase</h4>

<p>Strof goes after Grendel, let's get rid of this clown so
Strof can move:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 4:8, roll 5, 1 hit on Strof, Stamina to 7.</li>
  <li>Combat: 5:5, roll 3 for no effect. I made a mistake on Grendel's
Shield rating, it's reduced more than it should, going to roll with
it as-is.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stun-removal-phase-5">Stun Removal Phase</h3>

<p>Nothing stunned.</p>

<h3 id="cold-shutdown-phase-5">Cold Shutdown Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3 id="player-turn-7">Player Turn 7</h3>

<p>Strof is still stuck with Grendel, it's an ugly business. Actually,
Strof should have been using the Impair stat from Ubot to combine
with on attack. That balances out the mistake from above.</p>

<h4 id="step-one-movement-phase-6">Step One: Movement Phase</h4>

<p>Strof can't do squat.</p>

<p>Kelly scans Tube B25, roll 5, nothing in the tube.</p>

<h4 id="step-two-reaction-phase-6">Step Two: Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>Grendel of course reacts with <code>kill</code> target roll Strof:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 5:5, roll 4, 1 hit on Grendel</li>
  <li>Combat: 4:8 no combat.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="step-three-acquisition-phase-6">Step Three: Acquisition Phase</h4>

<p>Nothing to acquire.</p>

<h4 id="step-four-equipment-phase-6">Step Four: Equipment Phase</h4>

<p>Nothing to acquire.</p>

<p>Strof goes another round with Grendel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 4:8, roll 6, Strof takes another hit.</li>
  <li>Combat: 5+1:4, roll 3 for 1 hit on Grendel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chewing it down.</p>

<h3 id="stun-removal-phase-6">Stun Removal Phase</h3>

<p>Nothing stunned.</p>

<h3 id="cold-shutdown-phase-6">Cold Shutdown Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3 id="player-turn-8">Player Turn 8</h3>

<p>Strof is still locked in battle with Grendel, but
will likely prevail after a number of turns.</p>

<h4 id="step-one-movement-phase-7">Step One: Movement Phase</h4>

<p>Strof is stuck.</p>

<p>Kelly moves to Tube B25.</p>

<h4 id="step-two-reaction-phase-7">Step Two: Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>Grendel, roll 4, which is a <code>move</code> result, which is no effect
as they are in the same space.</p>

<h4 id="step-three-acquisition-phase-7">Step Three: Acquisition Phase</h4>

<p>Nothing to acquire.</p>

<h4 id="step-four-equipment-phase-7">Step Four: Equipment Phase</h4>

<p>Strof going after Grendel again:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 4:8, roll 6, Strof takes another hit. Dang.</li>
  <li>Combat: 6-3, roll 5 for another hit on Grendel.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stun-removal-phase-7">Stun Removal Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3 id="cold-shutdown-phase-7">Cold Shutdown Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3 id="player-turn-9">Player Turn 9</h3>

<h4 id="step-one-movement-phase-8">Step One: Movement Phase</h4>

<p>Strof is still contained.</p>

<p>Kelly scans Pod B2: roll 2, discover Armorig and Blind Pig in Specanal
Pod.</p>

<h4 id="step-two-reaction-phase-8">Step Two: Reaction Phase</h4>

<p>Roll for Intel and Agress for Blind Pig: 6, 5. Reaction roll3 for
no effect.</p>

<p>As usual, Grendel decides to attack:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 5:2, roll 1 for no effect. Bah.</li>
  <li>Combat: 4:8, no effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strof has a chance at Grendel in Equipment Phase.</p>

<h4 id="step-three-acquisition-phase-8">Step Three: Acquisition Phase</h4>

<p>Kelly might pick up the Armorig in a turn or 2, want to scan neighboring
pods first, looking for the med pod.</p>

<h4 id="step-four-equipment-phase-8">Step Four: Equipment Phase</h4>

<p>Strof goes after Grendel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 4:8, roll 1 for no effect.</li>
  <li>Combat: 6:2, roll 1 for 1 hit. I'll take it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grendel about done.</p>

<h3 id="stun-removal-phase-8">Stun Removal Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3 id="cold-shutdown-phase-8">Cold Shutdown Phase</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3 id="player-turn-10">Player Turn 10</h3>

<p>Hopefully Strof takes out Grendel this turn so we can get on with the
game.</p>

<h4 id="step-one-movement-phase-9">Step One: Movement Phase</h4>

<p>Shazam attribute roll: 3, 9. Reaction: roll 4 which is
<strong>(3)</strong> which means move into Strof's space with intent to kill.
Bummer. Targeting roll 6 which is Strof.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 5:2, roll 6 for 2 hits on Shazam which kills Shazam.
Which is probably pretty lucky!</li>
</ul>

<p>Typhoo: 7, 4. Reaction roll 6 for move, which would have to be into

<p>Strof is going to try to leave A14, roll 5 for Typhoo

<p>At the end of Turn 20, I find myself a bit bored with doing more writing
than game playing, so from here until I decide to pack it up, I'm not
going to record turn-by-turn details. I will likely record a few
impressions or results, and will definitely be adding to the MindMap
I've started (in the source code repository).</p>

<h2 id="turn-22">Turn 22</h2>

<p>Strof is going to head to Tube C and do some scanning.</p>

<p>Kelly is going to get to 9 Stamina, then see about getting into the
Armorrig located in Pod B2. Kelly makes the roll and is now at 9
Stamina, which is good, she will need it for getting past Mouse and
Blind Pig.</p>

<p>With the Armorrig, Kelly can more easily defend, and will have Port 9.</p>

<h2 id="turn-23">Turn 23</h2>

<p>Strof scans Risor B, nothing present.</p>

<p>Kelly moves into Tube B14 and acquires the Stungun with Status
Yellow. Repair attempt fails. It might be worth hanging out here
and getting this repaired before attempting to take on Mouse.
Kelly's stats are weak for fighting.</p>

<h2 id="turn-24">Turn 24</h2>

<p>Strof moves to Risor B.</p>

<p>Kelly makes a repair attempt on Stungun, rolls a 6
which puts it into repair. Now here's a question, can Kelly
rescan Tube B25 to trigger Mouse? It would make sense either way.
And the rules do not prohibit rescanning, only stating that Discovery
takes place only on the first time a space is scanned or entered.</p>

<h2 id="turn-25">Turn 25</h2>

<p>Here's the plan: Strof moves to Risor B, Kelly scans
Pod B7. Discovery roll 6, reveal DconPod.</p>

<h2 id="turn-26">Turn 26</h2>

<p>Strof scans Risor C, discovers Ambot, Specbot, and Scanner.
Kelly scans Pod B4, discovers NavPod.</p>

<h2 id="turn-27">Turn 27</h2>

<p>Strof moves to Risor C. Kelly scans B25 to get reaction from
Mouse, which reacts with 3/6, roll 5 for <code>Flee</code> into B2, which,
sadly, is where Kelly was planning to get to get the Armorrig.
Maybe bypass that for now. We'll see.</p>

<p>Strof acquires Scanner, status Yellow, let's repair, roll 5
to get to Green. Strof offloads Wepkit. Strof makes an attempt to
control Specbot, status 10, control achieved. Super helpful.</p>

<h2 id="turn-28">Turn 28</h2>

<p>Kelly moves to B25. Strof scans Tube C36 to discover ReconBot,
Golem, and Imrebot. Golem Intel/Agress is 8/8, roll 10 for
reaction which is <code>kill</code>. Target roll is 2, which is an attack
on Imrebot, current status Green.</p>

<p>Damage: 2:8 roll 4 no effect.
Impair: 8:5 roll which is 1 hit which moves from Green to Yellow.
Roll 6, Imrebot is <em>not</em> beserk.</p>

<h2 id="turn-29">Turn 29</h2>

<p>This is probably the start of the last 1/3 of the game, if not the
endgame. Depends on who stays alive.</p>

<p>Kelly moves into Pod B2 carrying the Stungun. There are two specimens
currently occupying, let's find their reactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blind Pig: 6/5, roll 7 for <code>Move</code> result.</li>
  <li>Mouse: 6/6 roll 7 for for <code>Move</code> result.</li>
</ul>

<p>For both of these, since everyone is in the same space, there is
no effect.</p>

<p>Next turn Kelly dons Armorig.</p>

<p>Note: Kelly could have scanned to trigger a reaction which could have
a good result if one of the specimens was able to kill the other. On the
other hand, if one of the specimens fled into the Tube, Kelly would have
a hard because she's super slow.</p>

<p>Strof is going to attempt control of Ambot before tackling Grendel, roll
8 for Yellow, and 2 for Ambot going Berserk. Crap. That's going to be
tough to deal with as Ambot has Shield 9.</p>

<h2 id="turn-30">Turn 30</h2>

<p>Kelly dons Armorig. Reactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blind Pig: 6/5 roll 9 for <code>Move</code>, which is no effect.</li>
  <li>Mouse: 6/6 roll 7 for <code>Move</code> which is no effct.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kelly decides not to do anything in Equipment Phase. Trying to Stun
either would require doing a damage check on the Rig, and that would
suck if the rig got damaged. She can just leave next turn as the Rig
speed is less than or equal to Blind Pig's and Mouse's Speeds.</p>

<p>Strof decides to take a powder because Ambot's speed is the same as
Strof's Speed, 3. So Strof can just leave next turn. And face the Grendel.</p>

<p>This turn took a long time.</p>

<h2 id="turn-31">Turn 31</h2>

<p>Kelly moves into Tube B25.</p>

<p>Reactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blind Pig: 6/5 roll 9 for <code>Move</code>, follows Kelly.</li>
  <li>Mouse: 6/6 roll 9 for <code>Move</code>, also follows Kelly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dang. At least that's the end of Reaction for this turn for Kelly.</p>

<p>Strof moves into Tube C36. Reaction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Grendel: 9/8 roll 5 for <code>Kill</code>, of course.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Damage: 5:7 roll 5 for 1 hit on The Golem.</li>
  <li>Impair: 7:8 no effect. Small favors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strof directs Specibot to execute Stun shot to combine with
his shot at The Golem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 7:8 roll 2 no effect.</li>
  <li>Impair: 15:6 roll 3 for a stun + 2 hits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specibot grabs The Golem.</p>

<p>The Golem rolls for Stun Recovery, 5, not recovered! Cool!</p>

<p>And that's it for that turn, a burly one, lots of new thinking.</p>

<h2 id="turn-32">Turn 32</h2>

<p>Strof scans Pod C3, discovers EVAbot, Erobot, and StasisPod.
Using scanner tool on Pod C6, discovers Restraint Pod 3, handy!</p>

<p>Now just need to keep The Golem stunned to get it moved into Restrain
Pod 3.</p>

<p>Kelly Hasty Moves to Pod A1 which has the Scapelock.</p>

<p>Reaction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blind Pig: 6/5 roll 2, no reaction.</li>
  <li>Mouse: 6/6 roll 11, <code>kill</code> attempt on Blind Pig. Heh.
    <ul>
      <li>Damage: 9:4 roll 5 which is 2 damage on Mouse.</li>
      <li>Impair: 4:6 is no effect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Stun check for The Golem, roll 4 stun recovery, bummer.
I didn't roll targeting last time, perhaps The Golem
will target a robot instead of Strof next turn. We'll
see.</p>

<h2 id="turn-33">Turn 33</h2>

<p>Kelly EVAs to Exlok, which is Pod A1.</p>

<p>Strof can't get away from The Golem, but he can scan Tube C25
to discover…nothing.</p>

<p>The Golem Reaction roll 11 which is definitely <code>Kill</code>, target roll 3,
which is "attack the lowest Shield rating" which in this case is Ubot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 1:4 roll 2 no effect.</li>
  <li>Impair: 7:5 roll 1 for no effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strof is going to take another whack at The Golem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 7:5 roll 3 and Strof takes a hit.</li>
  <li>Impair: 15:4 roll 4 for 2 hits on The Golem.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Golem is not going to make it, unless the dice are super lucky
to get a stun result.</p>

<h2 id="turn-34">Turn 34</h2>

<p>The next thing to do here is to figure out how to get the ship status
on EnvioPod, and work from there. Kelly will acquire EnvioPod on this
turn.</p>

<p>Kelly determines the status of EnvioPod, roll 3 for Level 1 (Red)
result. Ok, this blows, need to repair. What to repair it with?</p>

<p>It occurs to me after reading the rules, there is almost two games here.
The first is the "Discovery Game," where the layout of the ship and
specimens is figured out, and the "Restart Game" where all the resources
have to be arranged to get the systems restarted.</p>

<p>Where it stands right now, Kelly needs to fix the EnvioPod, but the risk
is a game ending roll of '1' on the Repair table, which would damage
the pod to "Ship Down" and end the game.</p>

<p>The best course of action is getting Strof to move Imrebot to the
EnvioPod to do the repair, provided Imrebot is functioning. Strof can
get there in 3 moves after defeating The Golem. Ubot might be the key
here if Imrebot is attacked and put out of service. Worst would be
Imrebot going berserk.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Kelly can do a Hasty to the Survey Pod, A2, and pick
up control of the Reconbot and continue scanning Tube C.</p>

<p>Back to Strof then. Strof can't really move until The Golem is put down,
so let's do that. Golem reacts with a <code>Kill</code> attempt, targeting either
Ubot (1-3) or Imrebot (4-6). It's Ubot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage 1:2 roll 5 for +1 hit on The Golem.</li>
  <li>Impair 7:5 roll 6 for +1 hit on Ubot, roll 4 and Ubot is not berserk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strof acquires control of Imrebot, which needs repairing, and is
also berserk and targets Strof:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 5:5 roll 4 for no effect.</li>
  <li>Impair: 3:5 no effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strof, however, chooses to attack The Golem combining with Specibot's
capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Damage: 7:9 roll 6 for +1 hit on Strof, who is starting to feel the
pain.</li>
  <li>Impair: 15:1 roll 3 for 2 hits on The Golem, killing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strof attempts to repair Ubot, which is a success. Strof can now
attempt to get by the berserk Ambot with a Hasty Move, while Kelly
moves the Reconbot into C25. The triggers reactions for both Ambot
and Imrebot.</p>

<p>That burned a turn. Ship Status drops to 4.</p>

<h2 id="turn-35">Turn 35</h2>

<p>The story is getting more and more interesting!</p>

<p>Kelly moves Reconbot into Tube C25. Strof does a hasty to Risor B.</p>

<p>Reaction from Imrebot is (rolling 7) <code>Kill</code>, but there isn't anything
else in the space to attack.</p>

<p>Reaction from Ambot is (roll 8) also <code>Kill</code>, but the only thing in
Risor C is the WepKit, which isn't an enemy, hence no effect.</p>

<p>This is going to be close…</p>

<p>Another turn burned. Ship Status 3. Kelly may have to move back next
turn and attempt repair anyway.</p>

<h2 id="turn-36">Turn 36</h2>

<p>Strof moves to Tube A36. Kelly uses Reconbot to scan Pod C5
discovering Stunbomb and CompPod.</p>

<p>Ship Status 2.</p>

<h2 id="turn-37">Turn 37</h2>

<p>Strof moves to Pod A5, attempts repair (roll 6) which is excellently
successful, moving the Envio level to 3 and Ship status to 12.</p>

<p>Kelly scans C2 discovering ConPod. Kelly will stay here a couple more
turns finish scanning…or would it be better to head to Tube C and
attempt to fix the robots? Kelly decides to acquire Turbolaser (Yellow)
and BotKit (Yellow). Repair attempt on Turbolaser roll 4 for no effect.
So much for cutting a breach.</p>

<p>Ship Status 11.</p>

<h2 id="turn-38">Turn 38</h2>

<p>Strof repairs again: roll 6 for another 2 levels! Excellent! Ship
Status is Go with respect to Enviopod. Still should increase the level
more, just to make it easier to get a restart.</p>

<p>Kelly does another repair attempt, because risking a degradation
would suck. Roll 2 for no effect. Kelly blows a hole anyway, let's
take a chance! Degradation roll 5, none.</p>

<h2 id="turn-39">Turn 39</h2>

<p>Rereading the Cold Shutdown procedure, I think I've already lost this
game: Cold Shutdown only proceeds one way.</p>

<p>I'm calling it here as a loss. I could finagle it to get a win, but
could not justify the win from the rules as written. It fulfills my
intent to play the game all the way through to a clear resolution,
in this case, a loss. I'm glad I stuck with it instead of bailing
with a "good enough for a first play" several turns ago.</p>

<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/pandora/g1-end.jpg" alt="The Wreck of the BSM Pandora game 1 end" /></p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This is a good game. The rules definitely need better organizing. I
suspect a fair bit of the game play could be streamlined at least a bit
without losing the essential flavor of the game. But overall, I like it,
and it's going into rotation with my usual opponent.</p>

<p>I'm glad I took the time to really dig into this game. There is a lot
more here than meets the eye.</p>

<p>Some questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cold Shutdown seemingly proceeds one way, down. Repairing a module
to bring it's status up apparently does not reset the Cold Shutdown
status.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is damage applied when crew is in either of the rigs?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose the ship is fully explored, everything is discovered,
what happens to a tool which is status Red? If it goes back in the cup
it's not coming back out. The rule on this makes no sense. It should
either be fully damaged tools leave the game, or they are allowed to
be repaired.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
