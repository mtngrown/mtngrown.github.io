Ottoman Sunset (4)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep  6 2020</time>
<p>I'm considering putting Ottoman Sunset into rotation to build up a
number of plays. Not sure how many plays I want to target, but I'm
thinking around 10 for this round. We'll see how it goes. I have some
Lord of the Rings LCG scenarios I want to beat this fall as well.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>04</code> Enver to the Front. Push Caucasus back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>02</code> Goeben Dominates Black Sea. Purchase Resources for
Eastern Theater.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>01</code> Intelligence Bureau of the East. Place Nagara in
The Narrows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>09</code> Armenian Volunteer Units. Buy another Resource.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12</code> Gorlice-Tarnow. Use Resource and roll 5 for Victory,
Purchase Dardanos emplacement, fight in Caucasus roll 6,
place Yildiz emplacement. NW 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>19</code> Senussi Revolt. Roll 4 against Mesopotamia, roll
Caucasus back to 4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10</code> Second Battle of Ypres. Defeat. Sinai is sticking nicely
behind the lack of pipeline. Super helpful. NW 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>18</code> Bulgaria Joins the Central Powers. Sinai still pinned.
Roll 2 against Mesopotamia, fail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>17</code> Grand Duke Nicholas Takes Control. Roll 2, 4 push Mesopotamia
back to 3. Emplace last minefield.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>05</code> Ghadar Conspiracy. Coup in India succeeds, NW 1. Roll 6 against
Caucasus, roll 3 against Mesopotamia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>03</code> Jihad Declared. Mid-day cards go in. Three failed rolls against
Mesopotamia, even with the +1 DRM. That's bad luck for sure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>23</code> Sinai Pipeline. Shuffle in the Dusk deck. Yeehaw.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>34</code> Yildirim (Thunderbolt). Roll 1 against Caucasus. Looking not so
good here. I should have a couple more Resources in play rather than
worrying about the Narrows. I'm doing better than the last game though.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>31</code> The Somme. Victory! Really helps. Roll 4 to push Caucasus back
to space 3 Van. NW 2. Need to get moving on Mesopotamia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>37</code>  King Constantine Flees Greece. Roll 1, 1, and 3 against
Caucasus. This is bad. I'll use Yildirim to negate Mesopotamia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>43</code> Bolshevik Revolution. Roll 4, 2 against Mesopotamia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>40</code> Lawrence Stirs the Arabs. Roll 3 against Mesopotamia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>24</code> Gallipoli Evacuation. Acquire another Resource for
Eastern Theater.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>45</code> Sykes-Picot Agreement Revealed. Sinai and Arab fronts
pushed back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>14</code> German U-boats in the Mediterranean. Purchase Resource.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>30</code> Asia Korps. Roll against Mesopotamia, 3, 2, 1, pushed back
Ctesiphon. Not bad. National Will is 2, still have more than half
the deck to get through, but this is my best play so far.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15</code> Armenian Massacres. Roll 3,2,1 against Sinai, bad. NW 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20</code> Landings at Salonika. Salonika enters play. Roll 2 against Sinai.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>32</code> Arab Revolt. Sinai back to Gaza-Beersheba.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27</code> Mesopotamian Siege. NW 3. Looking better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>21</code> Central Powers Meddling in Afghanistan. Coup succeeds!
Move intelligence to Persia. Roll 4, 2 on Sinai, push back to
Gaza-Beersheba. I'm more than half through the decks. NW 4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>07</code> Turkish Minelaying. Sinai back to El-Arish. Need to
remember Salonika, lurking in space 3 Monastir.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>16</code> Suvla Landing. Fail Salonika, Sinai. Bummer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11</code> Gallipoli Landings. Offensives against Sinai and Salonika fail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>22</code> Fortification of Gaza-Beersheba Line. Cannot place fort, Murray
controls that space. Offensives: Salonika succeeds, Sinai fails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>39</code> Allenby Take the Helm. This is bad, Sinai flips to 4.
Offensives against Sinai fails; Arab succeeds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>38</code> U-boat Campaign. Fail bigly. Offensives against Sinai
fails, fails again, suceeds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>44</code> Balfour Declaration. Offensives against Sinai fails, against
Arab succeeds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>49</code> Vittorio Venetto. Defeat! Everything is advancing, bummer.
Offensives against Gallipoli succeeds, Salonika succeeds, Arab succeeds.
Whew! Close one! NW 3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>46</code> Kaiserschlacht. Spend 2 for Resources into Western Front.
Offensives against Gallipoli succeeds, Arab succeeds, KS: succeeds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>26</code> Verdun. Defeat! Offensive Mesopotamia succeeds. KS: defeat
NW 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>29</code> Brusilov Offensive. Stalemate. Salonika offensive fails.
KS: fails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>41</code> War Weariness. Bummer. Sinai advances. NW 0. 11 more cards
to go. KS: Stalemate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>47</code> Army of Islam. Offensives Arab fails; Sinai fails; Mesopotamia
succeeds. NW -1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>36</code> Sandstorms. Mesopotamia retreats. Offensives for Arab fails,
German Staff Op, roll 6 for Arab back to Damascus.  KS: fail. NW -2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>06</code> Wassmuss in Persia. Coup succeeds. Arab offensive succeeds.
KS: fails. NW -1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>33</code> Yudenich Named Commander-in-Chief. Offensives Arab fails,
fails. KS: fails. Not looking good, this might be curtainsâ€¦NW -4
and that's the game.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A National Will collapse is a Crushing Defeat.</p>

<p>Still, not bad.</p>

<p>I'm going to put this up for a while. Not sure I want to bring it into
rotation right now. Would like to finish a few other games I have
already underway, and get back to LotR for a while. I can see myself
picking this up again at some point. Given further thought, I may
end up picking just one of the States of Siege games and just mastering
it, and it will likely be Soviet Dawn.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
