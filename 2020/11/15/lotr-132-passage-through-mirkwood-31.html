LotR 133 - Passage Through Mirkwood (31) and Jump Drive (8)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Nov 15 2020</time>
<p>I had my colleague JL over for the first time since the stupid plague
put everyone in "lockdown" aka house arrest. This is a work colleague who
also was one of the last people to visit, back in February. We've been
playing intermittently, some Android:Netrunner, and we even set up his
Gloomhaven box for a spin through the first scenario. He seems to have
settled in to Lord of the Rings game for now, so that's what we set up.</p>

<h2 id="lord-of-the-rings-lcg">Lord of the Rings LCG</h2>

<p>As in February, these quests were played with a pair of deck in the <a href="https://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/8185">Eowyn and the
Odd Fellows</a> Fellowship.
Very standard Single Core decks with Leadership/Lore and Tactics/Spirit.
Still fun to play!</p>

<p>In all of the following, I took the Leadership/Lore deck <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14515/anoblecoreridesforth-1.0">A Noble Core Rides
Forth</a>,
with colleague JL taking <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14516/anoblecorequestsforafight-1.0">A Noble Core Quests for a
Fight</a>.</p>

<p>We played Passage Through Mirkwood again, so that JL could get used to
the game. He had forgotten a lot about it. We beat the quest, but
definitely could have beaten faster, at least 1 maybe 2 rounds.</p>

<p>Our next play is likely going to be Escape from Dol Guldur.</p>

<h2 id="jump-drive">Jump Drive</h2>

<p>While this is my 8th game of Jump Drive, it's been a while, and I had
review the rules in some detail. This was JL's first play. I was able to
build an income engine (card draw) really early, which resulted in some
massive scoring on the last two rounds. JL ended up using the Explore
capability twice. Final score was 86 for me, 59 for JL.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
