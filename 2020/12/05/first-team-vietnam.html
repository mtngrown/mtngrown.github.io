<p>First Team: Vietnam is an early solo game, and one I've had for years
but never got around to playing. I have no idea how long it will take me
to get through a first play, but I'm considering leaving it up through
the remainder of June if that's what it takes. I had <a href="/2020/05/23/the-wreck-of-the-b-s-m-pandora.html">BSM
Pandora</a> up for
about 3 weeks, and got a very nice playthrough for that.</p>

<p>Some notes before getting started:</p>

<p>Unit designations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>US units are designated by <em>company/battalion/regiment</em>.</li>
  <li>NVA units are designated by <em>company/regiment</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>NVA unit placement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NVA start in the <strong>Unknown Box</strong>.</li>
  <li><em>Identified</em> NVA are in some box in the <strong>Zone Display</strong>.</li>
  <li><em>Contacted</em> NVA are on the <strong>map</strong>. See Section 13.5: <em>Any NVA
unit in a Location is a CONTACTED unit</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: this game was originally started on June 13, 2020, but it had to
spend some time on the shelf due to work overloads.</p>

<h2 id="turn-sequence">Turn Sequence</h2>

<p>This game has a really involved turn sequence. Normally I write out the
turn sequence in advance, then copy it to start the game. In this case,
I'm writing it out in Turn 1, and will copy and clean it up after the
turn is complete.</p>

<h3 id="command-phase">Command Phase</h3>

<p>US gets 20 points.</p>

<h3 id="intelligence-phase">Intelligence Phase</h3>

<h4 id="locate-lzs">Locate LZs</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Spend 6 for LZs: Zone B, D, E, 2 each. Victor and Bravo in E, Queen in
D, Zebra in B.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="locate-nva">Locate NVA</h4>

<p>Spend 3 CP, roll 4, success, roll 6 which puts the NVA 32d regiment in
Zone D.</p>

<h3 id="supply-phase">Supply Phase</h3>

<p>Spend 3 CP, 8 CP remaining.</p>

<h3 id="first-american-assault-phase">First American Assault Phase</h3>

<h4 id="first-airstrike-segment">First Airstrike Segment</h4>

<p>I'm going to B52 Zone D. Probably not a great idea with all companies
at full strength, but whatever, lets see how it plays out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>roll 2/2, no effect.</li>
  <li>roll 5/2, roll 7 for R1, 1/32 retreats to Zone A.</li>
  <li>4/1, roll 8, 2/32 takes a step loss.</li>
  <li>4/4, no effect.</li>
  <li>5/2, roll 12 for step losses on 3/32 and 4/32.</li>
  <li>3/2, roll 7 for 5/32 retreat Zone A.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="first-transport-segment">First Transport Segment</h4>

<p>Air Transport A &amp; B of 1/12 to LZ Queen in Zone D costing 2 CP.</p>

<h4 id="ground-movement-segment">Ground Movement Segment</h4>

<p>Not going to do any ground movement this phase.</p>

<h4 id="support-segment">Support Segment</h4>

<p>Passing on this segment as well.</p>

<h4 id="open-combat-segment">Open Combat Segment</h4>

<p>N/A so far.</p>

<h4 id="final-transport-segment">Final Transport Segment.</h4>

<p>Passing until seeing what NVA is doing.</p>

<h3 id="first-nva-assault-phase">First NVA Assault Phase</h3>

<h4 id="first-target-determination-segment">First Target Determination Segment</h4>

<p>All remaining 32d regiment NVA move to Zone D, ambush roll fails.</p>

<p>Nearest I can figure, the first stack goes on the SF base at D2,
the other stack on D5. That's a lot of firepower. Note: these
NVA units are not consider "Contacted."</p>

<h4 id="nva-offboard-movement-segment">NVA Offboard Movement Segment</h4>

<p>No offboard NVA movement this phase.</p>

<h4 id="second-target-determination-segment">Second Target Determination Segment</h4>

<p>Skip because no offboard movement.</p>

<h4 id="nva-ground-movement-segment">NVA Ground Movement Segment</h4>

<p>No ground movement this phase.</p>

<h4 id="nva-open-combat-segment">NVA Open Combat Segment</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Superiority: At Duc Co, the odds are 42:4, which 10 shifts right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Revisiting after a couple of months, I'm calling this turn over and
restarting the game on Turn 2. Here is the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/first-team:vietnam/g1-t1.jpg" alt="Overall map Turn 1" /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, restarting the game at Turn 2, after an absence of
a couple of months. I have very little recollection of how the game
proceeds, so starting at a fresh turn makes sense. The play for Turn
2 proceeded on November 9, 2020.</p>

<p>This is rough as I did not get enough of a play in on the first go to
recall the rules very well. Having to relearn.</p>

<h3 id="command-phase-1">Command Phase</h3>

<p>14 Command points left.</p>

<h4 id="locate-nva-1">Locate NVA</h4>

<hr />

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>Now being 1/3 of the way into the game, I suspect about half the turns
in the game don't really have much effect, where other turns end up
being really involved.</p>

<p>The US has 5 stacks on the map which will need end-of-turn supply, and
one or more of them may need combat supply as well. Given none of the US
units attack this turn, it's not clear how much combat supply could be
necessary, as it's not clear which stacks could be subject to NVA
assault.</p>

<p>There are 3 supply counters in An Khe right now. Only Plei Mei is
seriously at risk for being out of supply. Purchasing 2 supply counters
should get the US through Turn 6. The 1/12 needs to get to Pleiku, where
it's out of action until Turn 9 when it's completely recovered from
Fatigue.</p>

<p>I think it's a good turn to do some airstrikes. Here's the plan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Supplies: 2.</li>
  <li>Transport supply counter to Plei Mei: 1.</li>
  <li>Airstrike on F5: 5 x 2 for 10.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's an initial spend of 8, which leaves me with plenty of juice
for the 2d phase.</p>

<p>(I miscalculated, airstrikes cost 2 CP, not 1), so that's
going to hurt.</p>

<h3 id="command-phase-5">Command Phase</h3>

<p>Hit 'em hard in F5. Using 5 aircraft, we get 3 shifts

<p>The biggest blunder was placing LZs basically randomly on the map.</p>

<p>The next biggest blunder was not calculating VPs after every turn, so
that I could see how badly I was losing!</p>

<p>The first blunder was losing Duc Co SF camp. That needed to be held
pretty much at all costs. Losing that puts the NAV VP count so far
ahead it would be a miracle to recover from it.</p>

<p>I think there is good use for the very weak 1/9 unit, but I'm not yet
sure what it is. If it could be employed with a lot of fire support to
attempt to break or eliminate reduced NVA units, seems like a good use
it.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
