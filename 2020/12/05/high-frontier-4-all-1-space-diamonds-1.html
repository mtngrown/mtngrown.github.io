High Frontier 4 All (1) Space Diamonds (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec  5 2020</time>
<p>I'm supposed to be finishing other games which I've already started and
had to shelve because of work overload, but I just could not resist
getting the new edition of High Frontier on the table. It came about
2 weeks ago, and I had <em>First Team: Vietnam</em> in flight. Having started
that game in June, I figured I really needed to finish it up. I also
have unfinished games of Sorcerer and Burma, and haven't yet beaten
<em>We Must Away Ere Break of Day</em> quest in the Lord of the Rings card
game. All of which I'm "supposed to finish" before cracking open a
new game. Whatever. YOLO. I'm not as stoked about those as I am about
High Frontier.</p>

<hr />

<p>Today, I play the new beginner scenario "Space Diamonds." It's pitched
as its own game, and it sort of is, but I'm logging the play as High
Frontier regardless.</p>

<p>I've drawn the sail mission "The Heart of the Comet," which grants me
3 victory points (VPs) by taking the first Discovery Chit (DC) from
a synodic comet. Synodic comets in High Frontier are comets with extreme
orbits which can only be approached (in the regular game) at certain
times.</p>

<p>For Space Diamonds, all the missions are with the Mars zone on the map,
for which there are 2 synodic comets: Phaethon, and Icarus. Both require
a bunch of burns to get to. I'll record the burns turn by turn.</p>

<h3 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h3>

<p>Mapping my route: going sunward to pick up some solar thrust at the
Venus-Sol L1 right by Venus.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I will only have +0 thrust as the bonus accrues at the <em>start</em> of
movement, not during movement. Here's where I ended up:</li>
</ul>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier-4/space-diamonds/g1-t1.png" alt="End of Turn 1" /></p>

<p>The image comes from <a href="https://nornagon.github.io/hf-mission-planner/">Nornagon's handy route
planner</a>, something I'm
not capable of building at the moment, but would very much like to learn
how to build.</p>

<h3 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h3>

<p>I get a +2 boost, so I can burn 4 times. There is a different route
which is 3 burns and 1 turn (which costs a burn), which is how the
mission planner wants to do it.</p>

<p>In any case, 4 burns gets me to Phaethon, where I pass the hazard roll
(4) and I find an isofuel chit. This is pretty cool as I am in the
Earth zone. I could spend this to get an extra 2 burns and bring it on
home in Turn 3.</p>

<h3 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h3>

<p>Just burn twice to take off from Phaethon.</p>

<h3 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h3>

<p>Burn once to get to Apophis which yeilds an acorn looking
thing, which the manual informs me is Industrial, in this case for 3
more VP.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier-4/space-diamonds/g1-t4.png" alt="End of Turn 4" /></p>

<h3 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h3>

<p>Let's fly home.</p>

<p>My route goes to Earth-Luna L3 with two burns, let's see what the
mission planner says. It wants make a pivot, which would cost me
another turn anyway, so I'm taking my route which puts me at the L3
as mentioned. Actually, it puts me at a space right past the L3,
but still one burn from LEO.</p>

<h3 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h3>

<p>LEO, and game over. Let's count the victory points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chits: 1 + 3 = 4.</li>
  <li>Mission accomplished: 3.</li>
  <li>First player home! 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: 11 points.</p>

<p>What to do next? Another sail mission, or should I do a rocket mission?
I should probably all the missions, just for fun. They don't take very
long solo.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
