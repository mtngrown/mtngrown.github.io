High Frontier 4 All (2) Space Diamonds (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec  5 2020</time>
<p>I just snapped out a fast game of Space Diamonds using the very simple
Solar Sail, and decided I needed more, today. While there are 9 more
missions to fly with Solar Sail, I decided this time to fly a rocket.
Rockets in Space Diamonds provide an easy way into using the fuel strip
correctly.</p>

<p>For this game I pulled the 5-3 Nuclear Rocket, with the "Lineae-Vacation
on Europa" mission, which is to be the first player to reach the S site
on Europa. I think this is a good mission for this rocket, I should be
able to get there in 2-3 turns, unless the hazard rolls go nuts.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Starting with Wet Mass 8, burn from LEO to pivot at Didymos, which lines
me up on the Green Line for next turn.</p>

<p>Wet Mass (WM) 5 1/3.</p>

<p>Stopping at the pivot to save fuel.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Continue on Green Line through the next burns to the Jupiter Fly-by,
navigate the hazards, and get to the Valhalla site on Callisto.
Sadly, I'm stuck at the hazard at the Jupiter flyby, which kills my
momentum. Not sure I'll even be able to get to Callisto.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Hazard roll 4, at the lagrange point, burn twice and I'm at
2 1/3 WM. Basically, out of gas.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>Advance to next burn space.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>Advance to next burn space.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>Advance to landing burn at Callisto.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p>Land at Valhalla site on Callisto, fuel.</p>

<h2 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h2>

<p>More fuel!</p>

<h2 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h2>

<p>And even more fuel!</p>

<p>WM: 14.</p>

<h2 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h2>

<p>See if I can get Europa, I may need more than 4 burns.</p>

<p>Yep. Got to the L1.</p>

<p>WM: 6 1/2.</p>

<h2 id="turn-11">Turn 11</h2>

<p>Burn once and land on Europa.</p>

<p>Except, rolled 1 on hazard… :/</p>

<h2 id="turn-12">Turn 12</h2>

<p>Land on Europa. Refuel.</p>

<h2 id="turn-13">Turn 13</h2>

<p>Not in any hurry, let's fuel again.</p>

<p>WM: 13, with -1 net thrust.</p>

<p>Now where do I want to go next?</p>

<p>Back to Callisto to pick up fuel to get home. Being
stuck in Jupiter's gravity well is no joke.</p>

<p>There is a single hazard on this one, roll 3 to pass.</p>

<p>But I'm too heavy to get there this turn!</p>

<h2 id="turn-14">Turn 14</h2>

<p>One burn and land on Callisto.</p>

<p>WM 5, refuel to get WM 8, which lets me have 5 burns next
turn.</p>

<h2 id="turn-15">Turn 15</h2>

<p>Let's go back to LEO, will take a couple of turns.
First to the pivot which takes 5 burns, as shown:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier-4/space-diamonds/g2-t15.png" alt="Game 2 with
rockets!" /></p>

<p>WM: 2 5/6.</p>

<h2 id="turn-16">Turn 16</h2>

<p>Second pivot, as shown:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier-4/space-diamonds/g2-t16.png" alt="Game 2 with
rockets!" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-17">Turn 17</h2>

<p>Take it home! Modulo a hazard roll…roll 1! Dang!</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier-4/space-diamonds/g2-t17.png" alt="Game 2 with
rockets!" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-18">Turn 18</h2>

<p>Home to LEO.</p>

<p>Calling this the game.</p>

<p>VPs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mission accomplished: 4.</li>
  <li>First one home: 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: 8.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>For Space Diamonds, only the skull icons require a hazard roll. I would
have passed Jupiter had I only rolled for the skull.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
