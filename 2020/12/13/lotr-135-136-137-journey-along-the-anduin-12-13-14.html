<p>Three games today, with a work colleague. The first (12) went so-so, but
we ended up losing Gimli in Stage 2. We had a bad build up of enemies,
my hand just didn't work all game (Leadership/Lore), and my colleague's
hand (Spirit/Tactics) had some economy troubles. Regardless, we did ok
considering our hands and what the encounter deck served up. One notable
thing about this game was the amount of location clearing accomplished
by Legolas with Gondolin Blade: 3 progress each kill, and he made a lot
of kills.  If I recall correctly, what did Gimli in was a one of a 3
treachery encounter pull. He already had 4 hits on him.</p>

<p>Game 2 (13) we had to scoop on Turn 2 due to Hill Troll coming out right
away and killing Gimli or Aragorn. I don't recall exact details.</p>

<p>Game 3 (14) went a lot better. We stalled in Stage 1 to build a huge
tableau of allies. I managed to pull Steward of Gondor early on so
I had the resources to do, and passed Theodred's questing resource
usually to Legolas or Eowyn. Once Faramir was played, we were able to
quest through Stage 2 in a single turn, then hammered the couple of
enemies which were in the staging area, a Beastmaster and Wargs if I
recall correctly.</p>

<p>All in all an excellent afternoon.</p>

<h2 id="the-decks">The decks</h2>

<p>This set of plays with my work colleague is progression-style, the
fellowship set <a href="https://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/8185">Eowyn and the Odd
Fellows</a>. This is a single
core fellowship with a Leadership/Lore deck, and a Spirit/Tactics deck.</p>

<p>The Leadership/Lore deck is <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14515">A Noble Core Rides
Forth</a>, and features the power
trio of Aragorn, Denethor, and Theodred. It's a pretty strong deck in a
fellowship.</p>

<p>The Spirit/Tactics deck is [A Noble Core Quests for a
Fight]https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14516). This deck is not quite
as strong, as it is overweighted with Spirit compared to Tactics. It
could probably use a bit of rebalancing, but Tactics is just really
thin in the core set. May do some rebalancing for Escape from Dol
Guldur.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
