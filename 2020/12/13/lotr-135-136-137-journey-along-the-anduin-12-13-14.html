LotR 135, 136, 137 - Journey Along the Anduin (12, 13, 14)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 13 2020</time>
<p>Three games today, with a work colleague. The first (12) went so-so, but
we ended up losing Gimli in Stage 2. We had a bad build up of enemies,
my hand just didn't work all game (Leadership/Lore), and my colleague's
hand (Spirit/Tactics) had some economy troubles. Regardless, we did ok
considering our hands and what the encounter deck served up. One notable
thing about this game was the amount of location clearing accomplished
by Legolas with Gondolin Blade: 3 progress each kill, and he made a lot
of kills.  If I recall correctly, what did Gimli in was a one of a 3
treachery encounter pull. He already had 4 hits on him.</p>

<p>Game 2 (13) we had to scoop on Turn 2 due to Hill Troll coming out right
away and killing Gimli or Aragorn. I don't recall exact details.</p>

<p>Game 3 (14) went a lot better. We stalled in Stage 1 to build a huge
tableau of allies. I managed to pull Steward of Gondor early on so
I had the resources to do, and passed Theodred's questing resource
usually to Legolas or Eowyn. Once Faramir was played, we were able to
quest through Stage 2 in a single turn, then hammered the couple of
enemies which were in the staging area, a Beastmaster and Wargs if I
recall correctly.</p>

<p>All in all an excellent afternoon.</p>

<h2 id="the-decks">The decks</h2>

<p>This set of plays with my work colleague is progression-style, the
fellowship set <a href="https://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/8185">Eowyn and the Odd
Fellows</a>. This is a single
core fellowship with a Leadership/Lore deck, and a Spirit/Tactics deck.</p>

<p>The Leadership/Lore deck is <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14515">A Noble Core Rides
Forth</a>, and features the power
trio of Aragorn, Denethor, and Theodred. It's a pretty strong deck in a
fellowship.</p>

<p>The Spirit/Tactics deck is [A Noble Core Quests for a
Fight]https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14516). This deck is not quite
as strong, as it is overweighted with Spirit compared to Tactics. It
could probably use a bit of rebalancing, but Tactics is just really
thin in the core set. May do some rebalancing for Escape from Dol
Guldur.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
