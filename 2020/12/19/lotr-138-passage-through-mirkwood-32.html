LotR 138 - Passage Through Mirkwood (32)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 19 2020</time>
<p>Using a new deck, <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/18768/thegloinerator-singlecoreresourceengine-1.0">The Gloinerator - Single Core Resource
Engine</a>.
It's a clone from another deck, which I'm playing as-is to see how it
works. I rarely use the Glorfindel, Gloin, Denethor lineup, and of the
three, Denethor is the hero I've used the most in the past.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Henamarth Riversong</li>
  <li>Forest Snare</li>
  <li>Protector of Lorien</li>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>Valiant Sacrifice</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Erebor Hammersmith</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Henamarth. Scry Chieftain Ufthak.</li>
  <li>Quest: Glorfindel for 3 Will, draw Ufthak net -2 for
Threat 31.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road, ready Glorfindel.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gloin defends, draw shadow Driven By Shadow for
no effect as I have no attachments. Gloin takes 2 damage,
gets 2 Resources. Glorfindel and Denethor kill Forest Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Denethor reveal The Necromancer's Reach.
Put that on the bottom of the deck. Play Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Glorfindel draw Black Forest Bats which removes
Glorfindel which results in Threat 35. Crap. Good thing
I have a Forest Snare in hand.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ufthak and Bats.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn defends Bats, shadow East Bight Patrol
for +1 Snowbbourn is out! Henamarth defend Ufthak, shadow Forest
Spider for no effect. Henamarth is out. Gloin kills Bats.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<p>I forgot to play Valiant Sacrifice to draw 2 cards.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Lore of Imladris.</li>
  <li>Planning: Forest Snare on Ufthak. Play Guard of the
Citadel. Scry Denethor for Dol Guldur Orcs, I'll keep it.</li>

Dol Guldur Orcs, net 2 Progress clearing Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Glorfindel pays 1 to heal 1 on Gloin, Gloin
defends, shadow Dol Guldur Orcs for +1, Gloin takes 2 hits,
good thing I healed 1! Denethor scries revealing The Necromancer's
Reach, bottom of the deck with that thing.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Steward of Gondor on Glorfindel.

  <li>Quest: nobody, draw Hummerhorns for Threat 38.</li>

Gate, which is getting Secret Paths which allows clearing
Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: Forest Gate draw Daughter of the Nimrodel and Radagast's

area, possibly easier to clear Stage 2. Might also be good to
stall a bit here to get more allies out.</li>

  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

  <li>Refresh: Threat</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Overall, not bad for a new deck, although I am pretty comfortable
with the core cards. I have a nagging feeling I could have
beaten in one or possibly even 2 fewers round, but to be honest,
Denethor could never really get ahead of the scrying (almost
every card went to the bottom of the deck), and losing Henamarth
so early really hurt. I don't think this deck would do that well
with Journey Along the Anduin, but I might try it anyway some time
in the future. Of more interest is extending the Gloin/Healing
mechanic.</p>

<p>Of note, I had been planning to discard For Gondor! to Protector
of Lorien, really glad I didn't as it won the game for me. I think
that's a pretty powerful card in a multiplayer gamer.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
