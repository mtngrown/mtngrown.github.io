LotR 139 - We Must Away, Ere Break of Day (9)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 19 2020</time>
<p>Again for the Hobbit, iterating on <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/185887">A Hobbit Goes Adventuring
(1.2)</a>. The deck actually has
48 cards in it, but the page is showing 52. I don't feel like vetting
the deck, I'd rather play. I'll fix it after this game.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Erebor Battlemaster</li>
  <li>Forest Snare</li>
  <li>Feint</li>
  <li>Master of the Forge</li>
  <li>Feint</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
</ol>

<p>Not too bad.</p>

<p>Encounter: More like a grocer, no effect as don't have
any pipe resources.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Stand and Fight. I was going to take this out
of the deck and decided not to. It's not what I want to see right now.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, save money.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, draw Troll Camp for net -1, Threat 28.</li>
  <li>Travel: Troll Camp to help stall.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Heavy Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: Erebor Battlemaster.</li>

Troll camp, sadly.</li>

  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Quick Strike. I'm going to lose this game
soon if I don't start getting allies in play. These are all
late game cards which are critical, in the late game.</li>

  <li>Quest: Ori, draw Lots or None At All. Threat 33.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 16, draw Citadel Plate.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, draw Suspicious Crow. Net 1 Progress. Reveal
A Nice Pickle, put 2 discards on bottom of Encounter.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Suspicious Crows.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, shadow Cave Entrance for no effect,
Oin gets the kill.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 21, draw Stand and Fight. :/ Looks like
I'm drawing <em>all</em> of my non-ally cards first.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, draw Hungry Troll surge Hungry Troll surge A Nice
Pickle and both Hungry Trolls go back to the bottom of the deck.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 25, draw Galadrihms Greetings. Jeebus.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, I'll play Galadrhims in an action window
if necessary.</li>
  <li>Quest: Erebor Battlemaster, draw Lot's or None At All
Threat 38.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 29, draw Master of the Forge. :/ Amazing.
It's like I don't have any dwarf allies at all.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Erebor, draw Troll Camp, Threat 42.</li>
  <li>Travel: Troll Camp.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 33, draw Fili! Fili! Goddamn! Fili! FML.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Erebor, draw Troll Camp, Threat 46.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 47.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 37, draw Kili.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Kili, Galadrims x 2, Threat 35.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori and Kili, draw Lone Lands, Threat 37. Need
to quest next round to just clear Troll Camp.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 32, draw Erebor Record Keeper and Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Erebor Record Keeper and Dwalin.
If I can lower threat with Gandalf, I might have a crack at this
thing.</li>
  <li>Quest: Oin, Ori, Bilbo, Fili, draw Roast 'Em or Boil 'Em,
I don't think so, Test of Will that thing away. Net +1 on Troll
Camp.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-12">Round 12</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 36, draw Unexpected Courage twice, which is
ironic as I can't pay for even one of them right now. I want
another 2-3 allies out before handling the trolls.</li>
  <li>Planning:  none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Dwalin, Fili, Bilbo draw Suspicious Crow
which pulls Roast 'Em or Boil 'Em back from discard, which kills
both Erebors. :/ Net +1 on Troll Camp.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Crows</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli takes undefended, shadow Roast 'Em or Boil 'Em
which means I need to find another Troll Camp and add it to the
Staging area. That's it, location locked and when I clear Stage
1 I'm going to threat out anyway. Gimli takes 1 hit and kills
the crows.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<p>With 8 Threat in Staging, I'm almost surely location locked.
Let's see what happens anyway, maybe I'll draw some Gandalfs
or something.</p>

<h4 id="round-13">Round 13</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: loads, draw Zigil Miner and Quick Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: all, draw but Gimli, draw No Campfire, take the
surge for Wind whipped Rain. Heh, no attachments, no effect.
Net -1 for Threat 41.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-14">Round 14</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: loads, draw Thror's Map and Song of Travel.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Song of Travel on Gimli. Play Thror's
Map on Gimli, exhaust to swap Troll Camps. Now we have a fresh
Troll Camp with no Progress, it can suck up some quest progress,
although it's probably too late for that. Good thinking though.
Also play Zigil Miner. Hrm, with the Stand and Fights, I can
bring back the Erebors. Let's do it.</li>
  <li>Quest: All but Gimli and Erebors for Troll Purse.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-15">Round 15</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: loads, draw Erebor Hammersmith and Radagast's Cunning.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Hammersmith. Pity I didn't have Forest Snare in the
discard, I'm looking for that combo one day.</li>
  <li>Quest: Oin, Ori, Bilbo, Dwalin, Fili, Hammersmith, Zigil, draw
Suspicious Crow for net 0. Top of discard is Wind Whipped Rain,
no effect as it doesn't go into the staging area.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 44.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-16">Round 16</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: lots, draw Veteran Axehand, Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Quest: Same as before, I'm in location lock, bummer. Draw
Hobbit Lands. Net 0.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 45.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-17">Round 17</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: ???, draw Veteran Axehand and Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Miner of the Iron Hills, Unexpected Courage on
Bilbo.</li>
  <li>Quest: Same as before, I need Gandalf to break it I think. Draw
Lots or None At All, Threat 47. Net 0.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 48.</li>
</ol>

<p>Playing it out.</p>

<h4 id="round-18">Round 18</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: ???, draw Erebor Hammersmith and Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: Erebor Hammersmith, Swap the location back out,
I should have done that to get out of location lock!</li>
  <li>Quest: Same as before with Will 11, draw Lots or None At All
play Test of Will to negate. Still in the game… clears
Troll Camp.</li>
  <li>Travel: Troll Camp.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 49.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I don't draw a Gandalf, it's game over.</p>

<h4 id="round-19">Round 19</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: ??? resources, draw Gondorian Spearman and Quick Strike.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I need to get Dwarven Tomb in my hand so I can control threat by
recycling Galadrhims.</p>

<p>This was a weird one. I think I could have done better had I used
Thror's Map more effectively to help control location lock versus
buffering progress. Something to think about for next game.</p>

<p>I'm going to deck build before I play again.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
<p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
