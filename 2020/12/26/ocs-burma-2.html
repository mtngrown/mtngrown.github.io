<p>Note: this game was started on January 18, 2020. The events of 2020
overcame my interest in continuing my deep dive into OCS, although I
did extend my OCS rules SRS extensively since that time.</p>

<p>Back to Burma! OCS for another spin. This time I'm bearing down on the
rules really hard, focusing on drawing and throwing supply, and putting
in the time to get the critical details memorized. I'm using Anki, with
a lot of Clozes, followed by yes/no and true/false. I'd like to start
adding many more items, such as pictures of counters, simple puzzles,
map situations, etc.</p>

<p>For this game, it's another go at the learning scenario <em>Black Cats
versus White Tigers</em>. I made many mistakes last game, the most colossal
of which was not understanding HQ throw can be defined in term of Leg
MP. Revelation!</p>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h2 id="game-turn-1">Game Turn 1</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the upcoming turn for both sides.</p>

<p>The Japanese want to cut the CW off from supply, and destroy what units
possible. The CW wants to get out of the trap losing as few units as
possible.</p>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Weather determination (2.3, probably on map)</li>
</ul>

<p>Clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First player determination, roll d6 highest has initiative, reroll for
tie (2.3).</li>
</ul>

<p>Japanese moves first in this scenario.</p>

<h3 id="japanese-turn-1">Japanese Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Axis goal this turn.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>2T at Kalewa.</p>

<h4 id="movement">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Breakout segment  (12.8e) Check trace to friendly units in supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>None.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>Move to cut off CW units on the road at Tiddim.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like at the end of the movement phase:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ocs-burma/g2-t1-japanese-movement.jpg" alt="Japanese Turn 1 movement" /></p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>None for the Japanese.</p>

<h4 id="trace-supply">Trace Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">This phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Determine which units are in or out of Trace Supply (12.6)</li>
  <li>Replenish low or exhausted internal stocks (12.10)</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">It does not deal with the "On Map" supply provided by "S" and "T"
counters.</p>

<p>The situation further south isn't so good for the Japanese:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ocs-burma/g2-t1-j-supply.jpg" alt="Japanese trace supply
situation" />)</p>

<p>There are 3T in B5.22, which (sadly) I didn't capture in the photo.
My take on this is that</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is no Trace here due to more than 5 truck MP
through 2 hexes to B5.22.</li>
  <li>Forage is precluded due to presence of SP in B2.23.</li>
  <li>Given the SP in B2.23, 3-33/33, [1,2,3]-215/33 will consume
SP for Trace.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consuming SP trace is in section <strong>12.6c "Eating off the Map"</strong>.
The cost is normally 1T per 2 RE. However, the Burma-specific rule
<strong>2.5a Command Flexibility</strong> states that up to 10 <em>counters</em> may be
provisioned for subsistence with 1T. Ignoring rounding rules, for
example, 10 counter for 1T, 11 counters for 2T.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase">Reaction phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Non-phasing player releases Reserves (5.7), destroy dumps (12.11).</li>
  <li>Non-phasing player barrage (all types, 10.0) and transport.</li>
</ol>

<p>CW is going to do an Air Barrage mission on 1-214/33 in hex B2.27.
The air barrage rules are in section 10.2. CW flies a B25 and
a Hurricane for a barrage strength of 20, flak roll 10 with no DRM
for no effect, roll 10 on barrage table with 2 left shifts for <code>[1/2]</code>,
roll 6 for lose a step, which is elimination for 1-214/33.</p>

<p>(<em>Note: 17 Ind ARTY brigade should have fired here as well, it's not
going to be taking that supply with it</em>.)</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase">Combat phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Artillery barrage (10.1, no Air/Naval)</li>
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>
</ol>

<p>Japanese are going to pass on combat phase this turn.</p>

<h4 id="exploitation-phase">Exploitation phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Exploitation mode is defined in Section 5.9, with Exploition Phase
details defined in Section 11.0.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0), overruns cost 3 MP (8.1a, 8.1e prohibits
Exploitation result).</li>
  <li>Barrage segment</li>
  <li>Combat segment</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="japanese-clean-up-phase">Japanese clean Up phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove DG and Exploitation markers.</li>
  <li>Flip or remove Fueled markers.</li>
  <li>Remove train-busting placed by Allied player.</li>
</ul>

<p>Japanese turn complete.</p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h3 id="allies-turn-1">Allies Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allies goal this turn.</p>

<p>The main goal of the CW is just to escape without taking
casualties. Due to a successful barrage during the Japanese
player's turn, they may be able to do that.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-1">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>In Burma, off-map airbases get free refits, no SP needed. This is a good
deal as they get the aircraft back in service.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-1">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>CW has four of reinforcements which enter with a certain
number of MPs already expended.</p>

<h4 id="movement-1">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Breakout segment  (12.8e) Check trace to friendly units in supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>N/A.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>First move all the reinforcements.</p>

<p>Next I have to decide which units are going to have to stay to negate
ZOCs and which can move to escape.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>Air barrage with flight of 3 for 23 points on B4.27,
roll flak of 6 + 1 DRM, no effect. For barrage, roll
7/5 with left shift for close terrain for <code>DG</code>.</p>

<h4 id="trace-supply-1">Trace Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">This phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Determine which units are in or out of Trace Supply (12.6)</li>
  <li>Replenish low or exhausted internal stocks (12.10)</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">It does not deal with the "On Map" supply provided by "S" and "T"
counters.</p>

<p>All CW units in Trace.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-1">Reaction phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Non-phasing player releases Reserves, etc.</li>
  <li>Non-phasing player barrage</li>
</ol>

<p>N/A, nothing in Reserve.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-1">Combat phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Artillery (no Air/Naval)</li>
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>
</ol>

<p>17 Ind ARTY fires on 2-214/33 in hex B3.28, draw from big dump which
was left behind, roll 8/4 on two left shifts for <code>DG</code>. Acceptable.</p>

<h4 id="exploitation-phase-1">Exploitation phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment</li>
  <li>Barrage segment</li>
  <li>Combat segment</li>
</ol>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h4 id="allies-clean-up-phase">Allies clean Up phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove DG and Exploitation markers.</li>
  <li>Flip or remove Fueled markers.</li>
  <li>Remove train-busting placed by Axis player.</li>
</ul>

<p>Done.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-1">End of Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly recap the turn for both sides.</p>

<p>I don't think the Japanese can recover from this one. I'll play out
at least another turn to see what happens, but I might call it after
Turn 2.</p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h2 id="game-turn-2">Game Turn 2</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the upcoming turn for both sides.</p>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase-1">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Weather determination (2.3, probably on map)</li>
  <li>First player determination, roll d6 highest has initiative, reroll for
tie (2.3).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's kick it off:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Weather roll 3/4 for <code>clear</code>.</li>
  <li>First player: CW roll 9, Japanese roll 7, CW moves first.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="commonwealth-turn-2">Commonwealth Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Axis goal this turn.</p>

<p>Commonwealth has only one goal this turn, which is to completely
escape the Japanese. So far they haven't lost any units, which allows
losing a couple to prevent a loss. I think they can do it, though,
and it would mean the end of the game here.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-2">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>Done.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-2">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>2 SP in appropriate hex.</p>

<h4 id="movement-2">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Breakout segment  (12.8e) Check trace to friendly units in supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>N/A.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>Pull everything back and set up a blocking force in B1.30 with
the 2 artillery units in reservce to fire during Reaction Phase.
Note that these two artillery units will need to be fueled to
move again.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>Two air barrage:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>26 points against stack in B3.27, flak roll 5 for no effect,
roll 5/5 on 25-40 column with left 1 for Very Close terrain
for <code>DG</code>. This is no change in status.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>23 points on B2.25, roll 3/5 for no effect, roll 8/4 on
17-24 collumn shift left for 1 RE, shift left 2 for Extremely
close terrain for <code>DG</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Calling the game here. I don't see anything other than extreme
luck for the Japanese to even get a draw, given how many units
are now disorganized.</p>

<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ocs-burma/g2-end.jpg" alt="Turn 2 end of game" /></p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h2 id="after-action-report">After Action Report</h2>

<p>This was a pretty good game overall. I learned the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Japanese can forage for trace supply, which lets them operate
way beyond throw.</li>
  <li>Reserves really matter in this game as well.</li>
  <li>The Japanese can eat off the map using 1T to supply 10 RE, crazy.
This is the "Command Flexibility" in Burma game-specific rules,
section <strong>2.5a</strong>.</li>
  <li>Japanese can place a free hedgehog if they haven't moved during a
turn.</li>
  <li>Battalion-sized unit recover from Low or Exhausted Internal Stocks
with 1T instead of 2T. Other units recover normally (per <strong>12.10c</strong>).</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to save the counter mix to enable a 3rd game of this
scenario in the near future, with the plan of playing the first
turn in a single day then putting it away to finish later. The focus
of that game will be to get the Japanese to encircle the CW troops
right from the start.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
