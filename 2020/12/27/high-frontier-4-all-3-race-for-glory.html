High Frontier 4 All (3) Race for Glory
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 27 2020</time>
<p>Not sure what this writeup is going to look like as I'm working
through the tutorial scenario exactly. The point of it is to
ensure I read through the entire tutorial and note any questions
or confusing points. I've also been watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrDfGiLtU0U">stupendous 13.5 hour
video playthrough on
Youtube</a>. Since I've
played through the basic game in High Frontier 3 a couple of times,
I'm not anticipating too much trouble.</p>

<h2 id="year-1">Year 1</h2>

<p>CRP takes an Income Operation.</p>

<p>NASA does Research Auction Operation with <em>metastable helium thruster</em>.
NASA leads with 0, ESA raises 1, NASA matches and wins when ESA doesn't
raise again. 1 Aqua to the pool.</p>

<p>ESA does RAO for <em>neutral beam robonaut</em>. ESA opens with 0, NASA wins
bidding and pays ESA 2 Aqua.</p>

<h2 id="year-2">Year 2</h2>

<p>CRP starts RAO for <em>cat fusion Z-pinch torch robonaut</em>. CRP wins with
tie of 2 Aqua, paid to pool.</p>

<p>NASA auctions <em>nuclear drill</em> robonaut, ESA wins and pays 2 Aqua to
NASA.</p>

<p>ESA auctions <em>atomic layer deposition refinery</em>. NASA wins and pays
3 Aqua to ESA.</p>

<h2 id="year-3">Year 3</h2>

<p>CRP auctions <em>hall effect thruster</em>, matches ESA bid paying 1 Aqua to
pool.</p>

<p>NASA auctions <em>de laval nozzle thruster</em>, both CRP and ESA pass and
NASA gains thruster for free. Which is good as NASA has no $$$.</p>

<p>ESA auctions <em>ponderomotive VASIMIR thruster</em>, CRP declines and NASA
has no cash, so free thruster for ESA.</p>

<h2 id="year-4">Year 4</h2>

<p>CRP auctions <em>Carbo-Chlorination refinery</em>, eventually collecting
2 Aqua from ESA.</p>

<p>NASA does Free Market Operation (FMO) selling the <em>de Laval</em> thruster
gaing 3 Aqua.</p>

to pool. NASA earns 1 from pool from ESA boost.</p>

<h2 id="year-6">Year 6</h2>

<p>CRP boosts <em>Re solar moth</em> with mass 0. NASA gets paid 1 from pool.</p>

<p>NASA boosts <em>flywheel tractor</em> robonaut and <em>atomic layer deposition</em>
refinery, pays 5 to pool, gets one back after.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
