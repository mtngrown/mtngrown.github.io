LotR 143 - Conflict at the Carrock (4), Jump Drive (9)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 30 2020</time>
<p>A colleague and I have seem to have a semi-regular thing going on with
Lord of the Rings card game now. We're playing progression style
from the beginning, more or less. We did advance past Escape from
Dol Guldur after one play, we'll circle back to that later.</p>

<p>Today's excursion was Conflict at the Carrock, a scenario I haven't
played in over 3 years, since before I started at my current job in
fact. It's a classic stalling quest: stall as long as possible on
Stage 1 to build up a board, then knock out the trolls as fast as
possible. From my notes, I stalled using threat control to be able to
engage the trolls one at a time.</p>

<p>This game went pretty well. While we did a <em>very</em> small amount of
retconning, we didn't do anything which would appreciably "cheat" the
game, everything was along the lines of "remembering" to do something
from a previous phase.</p>

<p>I don't know how many rounds we played, but once the trolls came out,
we were able to beat them in two turns. Pretty good game overall.
My colleague did point out the grossly overpowered nature of both
Steward of Gondor and Unexpected Courage.</p>

<hr />

<p>We wrapped up the day with a game of Jump Drive, which I won with
Galactic Trendsetters, I ended up with a bunch of them in hand.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
