<p>The focus for this year is surviving another year at my currnt job. That
sounds depressing, and it is. That said, the 14th play of <em>Ogre:
Objective 218</em> bumped my H-index to 14.</p>

<h3 id="april-18-2021">April 18, 2021</h3>

<p>I'm getting a fair amount of games in for 2021. Normally Q1 doesn't see
much activity at all. Along with semi-regular weekend games, today I
found out that my care was stolen. I found out when I went to go drive
to the grocery store and my car was gone. It turns out it had been
stolen and the exhaust header removed, most likely for the palladium in
the catalytic convertor. The cops found it a few streets away. What does
that have to do with games? Nothing at all. But it's something to note.</p>

<p>For games, I'm continuing my focus on Lord of the Rings LCG, slowly
working my way through the Hobbit saga this year. I'm on the fourth
quest "Flies and Spiders," and while I haven't beaten it yet, I have
a pretty good idea how. Other games will probably wait until I take some
PTO from work.</p>

<h3 id="h-index">H-index</h3>

<p>This is the third year in a row where I've been sure I will reach
H-index 14, if not deliberately then as a by-product of regular play.
We'll see. I could actually still do this for 2020 as (I am writing
this) there are still 18 hours left in 2020. But as usual I have other
things to do today.</p>

<p>No special plans this year, work still absolutely dominates my life.
Would be cool to get through some Lord of the Rings progression style
with a work colleague, but that's going to depend a lot on both of
our work schedules.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>165/143</code> <strong>Lord of the Rings LCG</strong> I now have a colleague who
is interested in playing at least some of this progression-style.
If his interest remains, should get a few plays with him to augment
my main goal of getting through the first Hobbit box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>104/101</code> <strong>Absolutely Aces</strong> will almost surely get some plays,
almost surely solo, no idea how many. Good game for when it's light in
the evenings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>63/63</code> <strong>Hive</strong> Not anticipating any plays this year.
As mentioned, this game cracks my head open, and I just don't feel
like putting in the time to deal with it right now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>44/44</code> <strong>Ogre</strong> will see some plays once the plague lifts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>31/31</code> <strong>Zombie Dice</strong> catch as catch can, as usual.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>PanzerBlitz</strong> Nothing planned for 2021.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>26/26</code> <strong>Star Realms</strong> looking to be a customary wrap-up game for
Lord of the Rings days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>21/21</code> <strong>Race for the Galaxy</strong> probably limited to online play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20/20</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong> nothing anticipated until plague is
lifted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>19/19</code> <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> again, waiting on the 'rona to go away.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>17/17</code> <strong>6 Nimmt!</strong> probably not in 2021, don't have anyone with
an interest in it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/14</code> <strong>Battle for Moscow</strong> now has a very spiffy browser-based
implementation, and it's conceivable that I play a fair number of games
this year, in the browser.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Cathedral</strong> don't have this one, not going to get it as
it's solved and the IP owner exerts strenuous control over the
property, which is fine. These plays were all with someone else's
copy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>14/13</code> <strong>Ogre: Objective 218</strong> might get some solo plays in this
year. It's bound to play about as fast as Absolutely Aces, the
stumbling block being hidden hands. As it turns out, the 14th play
of this bumped my H-index to 14 as well. Not really planned, but sort
of inevitable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>14/12</code> <a href="http://consim.local:4568/tags/starforce.html">StarForce</a>
perhaps. I have an interest in digging
deeper into the solitaire rescue scenario, even though it's
basically pure luck once the initial shuttle loop is set up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/13</code> <strong>Vietnam Solitaire</strong> this is one of those "We'll see"
type of games. I periodically haul it out with the intent of playing
several games in a row, but I really only have the juice for one at
a time. If I didn't log every turn, I could probably get in more
plays.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Hapsburg Eclipse</strong> who knows? I think I've beaten this
once, it's a hard game. I think I might end up selling it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Objective Kiev</strong> probably not this year, planning on
focusing on Battle for Moscow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Pandemic</strong> this is a big "maybe." I ought to get it
out since we are, indeed, suffering from a pandemic. Seems
appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Soviet Dawn</strong> a definite maybe in 2021. This was my
first States of Siege game, and I think I like it best even though
I haven't played it in years. If I only have one States of Siege
game, it will be Battle for Moscow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Target Leningrad</strong> focusing on Battle for Moscow instead.
Will return to this later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>Leaving Earth</strong> a disappointment not to have brought
this out for even a single play in 2020. Even once in 2021 would
be nice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/7</code> <strong>High Frontier</strong> Will definitely be getting a few more plays
of this during 2021. If nothing else, even playing the "family"
scenario is fun, and deeper than it looks at first pass. Note that
this is combined plays of High Frontier 3rd Edition and High Frontier
4 All.  I've combined counts because I only play this game solo, the
game is emphatically declared to be a "sandbox" game, the rules
between 3rd and 4th editions are fairly similar, the game play
experience is the same, and solo modes pretty much suck for both
editions so much that even the <em>developers</em> house overrule the
printed rules for solo scenarios. Also, I didn't think I'd be playing
3rd edition much, but I'm going to put it in rotation anyway.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Flash Point</strong> didn't get out in 2020, no plans for 2021
although it is a game I enjoy playing solo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/9</code> <strong>Jump Drive</strong> is new to this list, but seems like it could
get some regular play, so I'm adding it in for 2021.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>OCS</strong> looking to get at least one play of Burma in for 2021.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong> Probably not, and this game is likely to drop
off my top 25 games by play count as High Frontier and Android:
Netrunner pick up plays.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>6/6</code> <strong>Android:Netrunner</strong> my potential opponent for A:NR is focused
on Lord of the Rings right now, which is not a bad thing as we're
playing that one co-op. We'll get back to A:NR at some point, possibly
not in 2021.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>1/1</code> <strong>Other COIN</strong> probably not in 2021, and COIN in general is
probably going to drop off this list. I don't enjoy the COIN games as
much as I think I ought to, which is disappointing.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wargame-specific-h-index">Wargame-specific H-index</h3>

<p>My wargame-specific H-index started 2019 at 10.  Wargames are so much
more time consuming that this index will increase much, much more slowly
than the overall H-index. I do not expect much progress on this list
in 2020.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
