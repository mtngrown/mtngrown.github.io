High Frontier 4 All (4) Space Diamonds (3)

<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 31 2020</time>
<p>I'm going back to work way too soon, so I want to get a few more games
in play before that happens. I am not looking forward to to going back.</p>

<p>For this game, I'm taking two ships, basically playing "both side of the
table" like a regular wargame. I think this will work really well as
both side have hidden information, and neither side knows what, exactly,
is being hidden. I'm using the white and the green rocket markers.</p>

<p>Missions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>White: claim the discovery chit on Venus aerostat-xity for 3 points.</li>
  <li>Green: have more Ice chits than anyone else at end for 6 points.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>White moves first and flies to Sol-Venus Lagrange L1 in 2 burns.</p>

<p>Green needs to go to Mars: two burns to the first red route hohmann,
which is in the Mars zone, going to be a long flight.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>White 2 burns to the hazard in front of the aerostat, roll 4,
enter 2 burn from aerostat, burned 3 times.</p>

<p>Green can move to the Sol-Mars Lagrange L2 and make the burn
before landing on phobos, turning up Life/Drop 1 chit for 1
point.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>White lands at aerostat, find Ice/Drop 3 for 3 points, getting
back to LEO will win it for White.</p>

<p>Green can get from Phobos to Apophis in 1 burn, so he does that, and
that will bring him back into the Earth zone. Finds 5 points of gems
at Apophis.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>White wants to high tail back back to LEO to win, from aerostat moves to
Acid Clood hazard, roll 5 for no effect, move into LVO.</p>

<p>Green gets two burns and moves from Apophis to Itokawa, finds gems for 4
points. Interesting, green may be able to win this.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>White burns all the way back to LEO, gains 4 VP for first to return.</p>

<p>Green has three turns to get to LEO, and can get from Apophis to the
radiation space between the Venus-Sol and Mercury-Sol L3 Langrange
spaces. This is first turn of endgame.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>Green has 3 burns. Entering the Sol-Mercury L3, he can move to the
Sol-Mercury L4 for burn 1, Sol-Earth L1 for burn 2, Cycler for
burn 3 bd he's home for 3 points.</p>

<p>It's going to be close I think within a point or two. Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>White:
    <ul>
      <li>Mission accomplished: 3</li>
      <li>Ice: 6.</li>
      <li>First home: 4</li>
      <li>total 13.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Green:
    <ul>
      <li>Gems for 5 + 1 + 4 = 10.</li>
      <li>Second home: 3</li>
      <li>total: 13.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It's a tie!</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
