High Frontier 4 All (5) Space Diamonds (4)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan  1 2021</time>
<p>Yesterday's two player game was so much fun, I decided to kick off the
new year with another two player game. I'll be using solar sails this
game, but dealing two missions each, just to see what happens. Green
will fly against White as before. (Mainly because I don't want to dig
out different bits lodged deep in various zip lock bags.)</p>

<p>Let's see what got dealt:</p>

<p>White missions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Claim the discovery chit on Icarus for 5,</li>
  <li>Have the most Life chits at endgame for 6.</li>
</ol>

<p>Green missions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have the most Gem chits at endgame for 6,</li>
  <li>Have 1 chit of each spectral type at engame for 6.</li>
</ol>

<p>This could be a much longer game than the previous.</p>

<p>Green is going to go first this game.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Green burns through Cycle and GEO to L1.</p>

<p>White is going to go to Icarus, following the Red Route
through the Venus and Mercury flybys, halting on the last
Lagrange burn inside the Mercury zone to pick up +2 thrust
next turn.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Green lands on Luna Aristarchus Plateau to find H with
Life/Drop 2.</p>

<p>White moves to the first burn on the Icarus approach. This
is an expensive mission.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Green takes off and lands on Luna Shackleton Polar Rim
to find S Isotope 1.</p>

<p>White burns twice into Icarus.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>Green can get to Phobos to pick up C Life 1.
She only gets a single burn next turn.</p>

<p>White burns twice to the Rapid Spin hazard, roll 3
no effect, lands on Icarus to find Gem 2. Bummer.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>Green goes to Deimos to find D Life/Drop 2. Off to
Mercury next.</p>

<p>White enters Rapid Spin hazard rolls 6 for no effect,
enters two burns. This is a terrible mission, and should
have a lot more victory points in my opinion.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>This is where the previous game ended.</p>

<p>Green takes off from Deimos, passes through Sol-Mars L2,
makes 1 burn to get to Sol-Earth L3.</p>

<p>White burns twice.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p>Green enters L2 at Mercury.</p>

<p>White plans to go to Hathor, burns to pivot.</p>

<h2 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h2>

<p>Green goes to Mercury North Pole, finds V Life/Drop 2.</p>

<p>White moves to Rapid Spin hazard at Hathor, rolls a 1
which means he loses his only chit. Bummer. White is going
to lose in a big way.</p>

<h2 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h2>

<p>Green could go home now and win big time even without
finishing either mission. Instead she plans a trip to
Cruithne and moving to Mercury L2.</p>

<p>White lands on Hathor for S Industrial 1. Womp womp.</p>

<h2 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h2>

<p>Green burns all the way to Cruithne, it's 4 burns,
find M Industry 3. Time to go home.</p>

<p>White enters Rapid Spin hazard rolls 6 for no effect,
has 3 burns to spend which can him to the Mercury flyby,
which gets him to the Venus flyby, which gets him to LEO
for the first one home gaining 4 points.</p>

<h2 id="turn-11">Turn 11</h2>

<p>Green burns twice.</p>

<h2 id="turn-12">Turn 12</h2>

<p>Green burns twice to get to Sol-Earth L1.</p>

<h2 id="turn-13">Turn 13</h2>

<p>Green brings it into LEO.</p>

<p>Final score:</p>

<p>Green:
  * Chit values: 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11
  * Most Gem chits: 0
  * All six types: 6
  * Second one home: 3
  * total: 20</p>

<p>White:
  * Chit value: 1
  * Icarus mission: 5
  * Most Life chits: 0
  * First one home: 4
  * total: 10.</p>

<p>Blowout!</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I should try to break this game by seeing if first
player advantage tilts it.</p>

<p>This is the second game going to Icarus. I think its point value
should be much, much higher, on the order of 12. This still would
have been a loss for White, but on the other hand, Green moved
first on two really easy missions.</p>

<p>For Hazards, what if instead of discarding half the value, 1 chit
at random was discarded? Otherwise hazards are just too expensive
to be worth the risk.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
