High Frontier 4 All (6) Space Diamonds (5)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan  1 2021</time>
<p>I'm pretty well hooked on High Frontier. The Space Diamonds
variant is fast-playing and let's me do the funnest part of the
game which is mission planning and movement.</p>

<p>We're back to Space Diamonds for another round of the inner
solar system, out to Ceres zone this time as this is a rocket
game instead of a solar sail game.</p>

<p>Here's the missions:</p>

<p>Green:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be the first the refuel 13 steps on the same site
without lifting off.</li>
  <li>Claim the discovery chit on comet Hartley 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>White:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Claim the chit on comet Borrelly.</li>
  <li>Claim the discovery chit on comet Holmes.</li>
</ol>

<p>First, let's lace in some chores, starting with getting a load of
laundry cycled.</p>

<h2 id="mission-planning">Mission planning</h2>

<p>Before getting going, it's smart to plan out how to acheive the
missions.</p>

<p>Green: going to Comet Hartley, and needs to refuel as a separate
mission. These can probably both be done at Hartley. I'd give Green
the edge in this game as White needs to go to two sites to acheive
both missions, which is necessarily going to take longer than visiting
one site.</p>

<p>White: needs to visit Comets Holmes and Borrelly to complete missions.
Since Green is going to need to sit and refuel on the same site for a
while, this might tip the game back to White. We'll see.</p>

<p>White is moving first this game.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>White has 3 burns to spend, and will take the Blue Route out to the
Hohmann past the Ceres turnoff. It picks up a burn at the Mars flyby.
That's pretty cool.</p>

<p>Green gets to the Hohmann right before the comet, will be able to land
next turn.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>White burns twice, stops at Runaway Ice Crystallization, rolls 6
for no effect (and nothing to lose anyway), lands on Comet Holmes.
Finds D Life 1.</p>

<p>Green burns once, stops at Runaway Ice Crystallization, rolls 2
for no effect, lands and finds D Industry 1.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Time for both machines to refuel.</p>

<p>White refuels for 3 steps going to wet mass 8 so it can
retain 3 burns. That was the operation, now take the move,
Ice Crystallization hazard roll 5 for no effect. Burn twice
to move to Hohmann.</p>

<p>Green needs to sit on Hartley 2 for 4 turnsâ€¦ fuel up to
wet mass 6 1/2.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>White can burn 3 times to get to Outbursts hazard, roll 4 for
no effect and land on Borrelly finding Life 1.
If White books it back to LEO, he wins this game. Green
has to stay on Hartley 2 for another 3 turns.</p>

<p>Green fuels to wet mass 10 1/2. This is going to be ridiculous.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>White does not need to fuel and moves to Ice Crystallization
hazard, roll 1 to lose the chit, continue to the Hohmanann at
Comet Phaethon.</p>

<p>Green refuels to wet mass 14. Yikes! Will move next turn.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>White burns all the way to LEO to get first player points.</p>

<p>Green takes one more step of fuel, now has 4 thrust, roll
Ice Crystallization hazard 6 for no effect, burns through
the pivot to Sol-Mars L3. Home next turn.</p>

<p><strong>ALT Endgame 1</strong>: Green moves to pivot for Hygiea family.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p>Green burns 3 times to get to LEO scoring 3 points.</p>

<p><strong>ALT Endgame 2</strong>: Green lands on Hygiea for C Drop 1. Bummer.</p>

<h2 id="turn-8-alt">Turn 8 (alt)</h2>

<p><strong>ALT Endgame 3</strong>: Green can only make it back to L5s, this
is where an afterburner might be nice! A couple more burns
and it might well have been a green win. Also, had the chit
been a bit better, would have helped.</p>

<p>Score:</p>

<p>White:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mission 1: claim Comet Hartley 5.</li>
  <li>Mission 2: Claim Comet Borrelly 5.</li>
  <li>First home: 4</li>
  <li>Chits total: 1</li>
  <li>total: 15</li>
</ul>

<p>Green:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mission 1: claim Hartley 2 for 4.</li>
  <li>13 steps of fuel on one site 5.</li>
  <li>Chits total 1</li>
  <li>second home: 3.</li>
  <li>total: 13.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not bad. Someone who didn't understand the map or fuel really
well, playing as White might have ended up dawdling somewhere
and losing the game.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I'm pretty sure Space Diamonds has a lot of luck baked in, namely,
a big dependence on mission and rockets. But I don't know how to
reduce the luck to get better balance. All in all, it serves it
purpose of teaching movement really well.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
