The Education of Periandrenn - Going Deep Vintage with SPI's Sorcerer
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 12 2021</time>
<p>Continuing with the trend to vintage, I'm following up the initial
play of <em>The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora</em> with another game of the
same era, <em>Sorcerer</em>. The game gets a lot of flack for the multicolor
pastel, oversized hexes on the map, but I actually think its pretty
cool.</p>

<p>Today is May 24, 2020. It's 2:10 in the afternoon. The plan is to work
through a single turn of the first, solo scenario, to learn how movement
and combat works. That will be plenty enough for this afternoon. While
I will definitely play more turns on days following, I may choose to
end the game once I've achieved sufficient understanding of the rules.</p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<p>Note: This game was started on May 24, 202, but had to be shelved due to
work commitments. Play picks up again January 9, 2021. The existing text
has been augmented in places.</p>

<h2 id="the-education-of-periandrenn">17.1 The Education of Periandrenn</h2>

<p><em>The Education of Periandrenn</em> is the first scenario in the game,
and is a solo scenario. The notion is the first sorcerer, a green
sorcerer, decides to tour the land after having first come into his
power. Hence the scenario starts with a single green sorcerer and
a green human infantry, deployed on the map at the city Kel-Fannyan
(hex 0416).</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>The solo scenario consists of a Green Sorcerer and associated Human
infantry unit starting in the city of Kel-Fannyan. The goal is to
tour all the other cities and return to Kel-Fannyan.</p>

<h3 id="a-first-player-movement-and-conjuration-phase">A. First Player Movement and Conjuration Phase</h3>

<p>For the solo game, there is an initial "Magic Unit Selection Phase"
occurring before movement. For the first turn, Green and Purple Dragons,
Purple Infantry, and Blue Fortress drawn randomly. Appearance in
the following order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Blue Fortress: 0719.</li>
  <li>Green Dragon: 0518.</li>
  <li>Purple Dragon and Infantry. 0716.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, this blows, my Green Sorcerer can't ditch the Infantry, and can't
teleport, it's shanks mare at 3 hexes per turn all the way around
the map. Bah. I am for sure not going to play this all the way through.
So they move to 0717.</p>

<h3 id="b-joint-attrition-phase">B. Joint Attrition Phase</h3>

<p>Nothing here for Sorcerer.</p>

<h3 id="c-joint-combat-phase">C. Joint Combat Phase</h3>

<p>N/A. first turn for Sorcerer.</p>

<p>For Green Dragon, time to read the Combat rules.</p>

<p>The way I read the rules, Combat is simultaneous, with results applied
after all results are computed. Start with Dragon attacking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Green Dragon in Yellow Hex gets +5. Since neither the Green Sorcerer
nor the human infantry are traveling alone (they are traveling
together), they also get augmented with +5: 8:9 is -1 differential
on the Neutral row, roll 3 for a Pin. Turnabout, roll 5 on +1 column
which is also a Pin.</li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn't make sense, and I'm going to leave it right here for now,
pick it up again tomorrow or later in the week. Or maybe later,
depending on the load induced from work.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/sorcerer/g1.jpg" alt="Sorcerer first play" /></p>

<p>I think that's enough for Turn 1. Going to declare success and move
on to Turn 2.</p>

<p>In fact, a magic cyclone sweeps in from the heavens and removes all the
enemy pieces! Wow!</p>

<h3 id="g-game-turn-interphase">G. Game-Turn Interphase</h3>

<p>Advance the game turn marker on the map.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-1">End of Turn 1.</h3>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>After the smashing success of Turn 1, we attempt Turn 2 in hope for
more clear success.</p>

<h3 id="a-enemy-magic-unit-selection">A. Enemy Magic Unit Selection</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">This is a special phase for the solo scenario. Draw 4 units
and arrange in color order as determined by a die roll against the Color
Value Chart on the map.</p>

<p>The rules say 4, but I say no no no, I'm only drawing 1, and that turns
out to be a green dragon. Roll 6 which is purple. But with only one
unit, green is first anyway. Convenient!</p>

<h3 id="b-first-player-movement-and-conjuration-phase">B. First Player Movement and Conjuration Phase</h3>

<p>Sorcerer moves to Ivor-Vorranna, city number 1 on the tour.
Movement is limited to 3 hexes due to rules constraint of
not leaving the human behind.</p>

<h3 id="c-joint-attrition-phase">C. Joint Attrition Phase</h3>

<p>There are no magic units on the board at this moment due to the
previously noted cyclone, hence no attrition.</p>

<h3 id="d-joint-combat-phase">D. Joint Combat Phase</h3>

<p>No combat at the moment.</p>

<h3 id="e1-first-color-enemy-magic-unit-movement-phase">E.1 First Color Enemy Magic Unit Movement Phase</h3>

<p>We have us a green dragon, he's going to land in…hex 1115,
which is two hexes away. The movement is from Green hex to Gray hex.
Leaving the Green hex costs 6.</p>

<p><strong>Joint attrition</strong> draw purple, blue, no attrition.</p>

<p><strong>Joint combat</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Dragon first: attack with 3, defenders have 5 for Combat Differential
of -2. Reading the Neutral line since non-magical is involved, rolling 6
yields no effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sorcerer and human: Combat differential +2, roll 6 for a <code>P</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And I'm calling Turn 2 here. Very good! We'll deal with the Pinned
dragon in a gray hex next turn.</p>

<h3 id="f-game-turn-interphase">F. Game-Turn Interphase</h3>

<p>Move the turn marker.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-2">End of Turn 2</h3>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<p>Let's get on with it, only a dozen more cities to go.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>We're doing pretty well here, I'm actually enjoying the experience.
I think when I started this game last spring, I just didn't have the
patience to work with it. These vintage games have to be taken at their
own pace.</p>

<h3 id="a-enemy-magic-unit-selection-1">A. Enemy Magic Unit Selection</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">This is a special phase for the solo scenario. Draw 4 units
and arrange in color order as determined by a die roll against the Color

<p>Let's pick another enemy from our grab bag. Just one until we know what
happens to green dragon in gray hex. Then we'll grab two. Pulling…
green dragon…no we have one of those, let's something
different…pulling…green dragon, what the hell? Pull another, red
dragon, that's better.</p>

<h3 id="b-first-player-movement-and-conjuration-phase-1">B. First Player Movement and Conjuration Phase</h3>

<p>Periandrenn and guard move to hex 1217, which is the city Piriandronna.</p>

<h3 id="c-joint-attrition-phase-1">C. Joint Attrition Phase</h3>

<p>Apparently, units in gray hexes never undergo attrition.</p>

<h3 id="d-joint-combat-phase-1">D. Joint Combat Phase</h3>

<p>No combat as there is nothing else in the hex.</p>

<h3 id="e1-first-color-enemy-magic-unit-movement-phase-1">E.1 First Color Enemy Magic Unit Movement Phase</h3>

<p>Didn't deal with first color as only choosing one with the
green dragon pinned, we have the red dragon in hex 1318, one
hex away and an easy move to Piriandronna.</p>

<p><strong>Joint attrition</strong> red dragon undergoes attrition being in a white
space.</p>

<p><strong>Joint combat</strong>o</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Dragon: CD -2 roll 4 for no effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Periandrenn: CD +2 roll 6 for <code>P</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it for Turn 3.</p>

<h3 id="f-game-turn-interphase-1">F. Game-Turn Interphase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the turn marker on the Turn Track.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-3">End of Turn 3</h3>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>We'll pull two enemies this time. The red dragon in Piriandronna will
attrit away.</p>

<p>Yellow appears in 1520, moves to 1519.</p>

<p><strong>Joint attrition</strong> draw blue and green, no yellow attrition.</p>

<p><strong>Joint combat</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Demon: CD 0, roll 1 for 1 step loss. That sucks.</li>
  <li>Periandrenn: roll 5 for no effect, more suck.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="e2-second-color-enemy-magic-unit-movement-phase">E.2 Second Color Enemy Magic Unit Movement Phase</h3>

<p>Purple appear in hex 1519.</p>

<p><strong>Joint attrition</strong>: draw purple, green. Roll 2, which induces
purple attrition.</p>

<p><strong>Joint Combat</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demon: CD -2 roll 6 for no effect.</li>
  <li>Periandrenna: CD +2 roll 4 for <code>1</code> and demon elimination. Bam.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="f-game-turn-interphase-2">F. Game-Turn Interphase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Advance the turn marker on the Turn Track.</p>

<p>I think I'm getting the hang of it. Seems sort of cool.
The full game has got to be borderline chaos. I'm thinking it might be
pretty fun.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-4">End of Turn 4</h3>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>We start the Turn 5 in hex 1519, accompanied by a Yellow Demon at full

<h3 id="a-enemy-magic-unit-selection-3">A. Enemy Magic Unit Selection</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">This is a special phase for the solo scenario. Draw 4 units

<p>We're on the way to Triann-Afretta, and have a choice of landing in an
orange hex, or in a red hex. I have no idea which is better, so let's
choose the red hex 1721.</p>

<p>Purple lands in 1620, moves to 1721 engage.</p>

<p><strong>Joint Attrition</strong> draw purple and red. Roll 6 which is
no effect, purple is least subject to attrition in red hexes.</p>

<p><strong>Joint combat</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Demon: strength 5 + 1 for color value, CD +1.
Roll 6 for no effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sorcerer: strength 1 + 1 + 3 for CD -1, roll 5
for no effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sorcerer: strength 1 + 1 + 3 for color value.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Survived that round.</p>

<h3 id="e2-second-color-enemy-magic-unit-movement-phase-1">E.2 Second Color Enemy Magic Unit Movement Phase</h3>

<p>This is the green troll, who can't move away because it costs
6 to leave the hex, and he's going to attrit anyway. Sucks to be
him.</p>

<p><strong>Joint Attrition</strong></p>

<p>Green troll attrits, no red units at this time.</p>

<h3 id="e3-third-color-enemy-magic-unit-movement-phase">E.3 Third Color Enemy Magic Unit Movement Phase</h3>

<p>Yellow moves to 1721.</p>

<p><strong>Joint attrition</strong> draw green and red again. What are the odds?
Troll is gone.</p>

<p><strong>Joint combat</strong> this is not good, a yellow in a red hax is +4.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demon is 9 total, CD +4 roll 5 for <code>2</code>. Really bad result
for sorcerer, the human is toast and the sorcerer loses a step.</li>
  <li>Sorcerer is 5 total, CD -4, roll 2 for no effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorcerer needs to get to green hex.</p>

<p>So, Periandrenn is depleted 1 step, and he's lost his guardian.

<p>Actually, green was first, but whatever, the green unit is going to
attrit anyway. With dragons, that just means they lose movement rather
than combat power.</p>

<p><strong>Joint attrition</strong> draw two ATTR chits from cup: red, blue.</p>

<p>No effect. I played the troll wrong above. He should still be in this
hex. Whatever.</p>

<p><strong>Joint combat</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>dragon 3 + 6, CD +2 roll 6 for <code>P</code>.</li>
  <li>Periandrenn 1 + 6, CD -2 roll 5 for no effect.</li>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p>I'm at a bit of a crossroads here. I could wrap the game here with
confidance that I have the largest part of the rules working. Or
I could continue until a clear sorcerer loss. Or I could do some "magical
augmentation" (which is to say add the infantry back in, and a green
demon) and continue.</p>

<p>I think what I'll do is start drawing 4 enemies per turn per the
scenario rules, and see how far I get.</p>

  <li>5 MP this is a good place to conjure a green demon.</li>
</ul>

<p>The human infantry was limited to 3 MP, super slow.</p>

<p>Given I understand how trolls work (they basically don't move),
I think this scenario is definitely winnable, the key is in how few
turns can it be done.</p>

<p>I am really glad I played this all the way through to a clear finish.
At least, as clear as I understand the rules at the moment.</p>

<p>Questions from playing Scenario 1:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Trolls apparently can't move from their color hex at all unless
accompanied by a friendly sorcerer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Combat augementation, add to stack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read Joint Attrition as pulling a new pair of ATTR markers
from the cup and applying it to all units.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I am definitely going to play this scenario again to see if I can
beat the odds.</p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<hr />

<p>Some examples which I'll clean up later.</p>

<p>Example 13.74</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/sorcerer/example-13.74.jpg" alt="Example 13.74" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Hex: orange.</li>
  <li>Attacker: Blue-Yellow-Red sorcerer with raw strength 6, Yellow demon raw
strength 5. These are augmented with a +5 which is 16. But the rules
say 15 instead, and I don't know what the discrepancy is yet.</li>
  <li>Defender: Purple sorcerer, purple air dragon, human infantry for
raw strength 7 + 2 augmentation for 9 which matches the rules.</li>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
