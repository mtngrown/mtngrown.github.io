HF4A 8 - CEO (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jan 17 2021</time>
<p>This is my first play of the HF 4 Core rules, the CEO solitaire variant.
From the forums, this is a pretty brutal scenario. I'm going to play it
as strictly as I can and take a loss to close out the play. There are a
lot more rules in Core, plenty to learn.</p>

<p>For CEO, if I don't "kill" anyone, I have 24 turns to generate 8 KPI,
which I can get if I simply get a factory built on a site. That seems
doable.</p>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

<h2 id="year-1">Year 1</h2>

<p>Spend 1 to acquire Ablative Plate thruster.</p>

<h2 id="year-2">Year 2</h2>

<p>Spend 1 to acquire Pulsed Inductive thruster.</p>

<h2 id="year-3">Year 3</h2>

<p>Spend 1 to acquire Nuclear Drill robonaut.</p>

<h2 id="year-4">Year 4</h2>

<p>Spend 1 to acquire Rankine Solar Dynamic generator.</p>

<h2 id="year-5">Year 5</h2>

<p>Sell Nuclear Drill robonaut.</p>

<h2 id="year-6">Year 6</h2>

<p>Acquire Tungsten Resistojet robonaut.</p>

<h2 id="year-7">Year 7</h2>

<p>Sell Ablative Plate thruster.</p>

<h2 id="year-8">Year 8</h2>

<p>Acquire Electroforming refinery.</p>

<h2 id="year-9">Year 9</h2>

<p>Sell Pulsed Inductive thruster.</p>

<p>I have not been rolling for events. I'll start doing that
next. Not all the event rolls are bad (just most of them).</p>

<h2 id="year-10">Year 10</h2>

<p>Boost stack to LEO. Costs 5 A.</p>

<p>I still need a radiator.</p>

<h2 id="year-11">Year 11</h2>

<p>Purchase Mo/Li Heat Pipe.</p>

<h2 id="year-12">Year 12</h2>

<p>Event: Glitch. Will need add crew to fix this.</p>

<p>Purchase Dumbo thruster.</p>

<h2 id="year-13">Year 13</h2>

<p>Sell Dumbo thruster.</p>

<p>Board meeting has no effect.</p>

<h2 id="year-14">Year 14</h2>

<p>Event: Glitch.</p>

<p>Purchase Ponderomtive Vasimir thruster.</p>

<h2 id="year-15">Year 15</h2>

<p>Sell thruster.</p>

<h2 id="year-16">Year 16</h2>

<p>Event: Inspiration.
Boost. Free cargo hook up with rocket and crew, remove glitch,
crew offloads.</p>

<h2 id="year-17">Year 17</h2>

<p>Fund raise: Centrist, one point of Aqua.</p>

<p>Fuel 6 and burn to Cycler, move to Rad Hazard and roll 1 with
thrust 4 we pass. Burn through GEO to L2 and Hohmann, stop on the red
Hohmann.</p>

<h2 id="year-18">Year 18</h2>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<p>Fund raise, move to Research Grants. This will get around the
two Aqua cost I think. I get one A from this.</p>

<h2 id="year-19">Year 19</h2>

<p>Buy reactor for 1.</p>

<p>Continue to loiter at the Hohmann.</p>

<h2 id="year-20">Year 20</h2>

<p>Event: roll 4, pad explosion, but no effect for me.</p>

<p>Sell reactor for 3.</p>

<p>Move to the Arsia mon caves aerobrake and lond, paying 3 for FINAO.</p>

<h2 id="year-21">Year 21</h2>

<p>Prospect, autoclaimed.</p>

<h2 id="year-22">Year 22</h2>

<p>Event: Glitch. Blows.</p>

<h2 id="year-23">Year 23</h2>

<p>Industrialize, glitch trigger roll 1 for no effect, decommissioning the
whole stack.</p>

<h2 id="year-24">Year 24</h2>

<p>Event: Pad Explosion.</p>

<h2 id="year-25">Year 25</h2>

<p>Board meeting, reuired KPI is 7 + 1 for 8. We're good.</p>

<h2 id="year-26">Year 26</h2>

<p>Event: Inspiration, which just crapped on my C cards.</p>

<p>Sell refinery for 3.</p>

<h2 id="year-27">Year 27</h2>

<p>Buy reactor for 1.</p>

<h2 id="year-28">Year 28</h2>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<p>Sell radiator.</p>

<h2 id="year-29">Year 29</h2>

<p>Buy Neutral Beam robonaut.</p>

<h2 id="year-30">Year 30</h2>

<p>Event: Budget cuts, discard generator.</p>

<p>Buy Radiator for ET Production.</p>

<h2 id="year-31">Year 31</h2>

<p>ET Produce Electrostatic membrane.</p>

<h2 id="year-32">Year 32</h2>

<p>Event: flare event, but I'm immune on Mars.</p>

<p>Deliver operation: Radiator to LEO.</p>

<h2 id="year-33">Year 33</h2>

<p>Buy Solar Moth thruster.</p>

<h2 id="year-34">Year 34</h2>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<p>Sell reactor.</p>

<h2 id="year-35">Year 35</h2>

<p>Buy Hall Effect thruster.</p>

<p>ET Produce Ion Drive.</p>

<h2 id="year-36">Year 36</h2>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<p>Delivery.</p>

<h2 id="year-37">Year 37</h2>

<p>Board meeting: need 18 KPI, but only have 9. That's crazy.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This feels very luck driven to me. There are so many ways to get set
back every other turn on a dice roll it's crazy.</p>

<p>I think a valid strategy here is basically optimize for speed, <em>never</em>
make a FINAO roll, it's too expensive and that money will be critically
needed. Spending FINAO takes 2+ turns off the game. And if a hazard
roll ends the game early, that's fine.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
