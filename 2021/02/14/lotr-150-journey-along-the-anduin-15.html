LotR 150 - Journey Along the Anduin (15)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 14 2021</time>
<p>I'm taking a <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/236082">Gloin - Glorfindel</a>
deck for a Journey Along the Anduin. I don't think it will do super well
as it has a really high starting threat, and no threat reduction other
than Gandalf. On the other hand, it's liable to be pretty easy to stall
it along until getting a nice tableau for blasting Stage 2.</p>

<p>Starting hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Protector of Lorien</li>
  <li>Henamarth Riversong</li>
  <li>Lorien's Wealth</li>
  <li>Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Grim Resolve</li>
  <li>Gleowine</li>
</ol>

<p>Encounter: The Brown Lands. That might be game over…</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry with Denethor, Treacherous Fog, I'll take it. Play
Protector of Lorien on GLorfindel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Glorfindel, Gloin, draw Treacherous Fog, discard Lorien's
Wealth for +1 Will to match, no net gain or loss, perfect.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Brown Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Forest Snare, perfect.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Misty Mountain Goblins. I need to drop
threat with Gandalf this round. It sucks from a reource
perspective, but necessary because I just don't have enough
resources to pull the Troll down and snare him next turn.
Gandalf can take care of the bats. Threat 25.</li>
  <li>Quest: Glorfindel, net 0 with Misty Mpuntain Giblins.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Misty Mountain Goblins.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gloin defends, shadow Despair, Gloin gets 2 hits
and 2 resources. Gandalf swings for 4 to kill the Goblins.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 26.</li>
</ol>

<p>We're in much better shape now.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Stewrd of Gondor. Excellent.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Steward of Gondor on Glorfindel. Exhaust
to play Henamarth. Scry with Denethor to find Dol Guldur
Orcs. Do I want to keep this in play? Yes, and deal the
damage to Glorfindel, who will be the only quester. Pay 1
to heal 1 damage from Gloin. Play Gleowine.</li>
  <li>Quest: Glorfindel, draw Dol Guldur Orc and put 2 damage
on Glorfindel.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gloin defends, shadow Chieftain Ufthak for a big
whiff on the Encounter deck! Gloin takes another damage,
gets another resource. Sadly, the orcs stay engaged for now.
But, I can scry with Henamarth to find Gladden Fields, and
I can draw a card with Gleowine for Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 27.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Gleowine.</li>
  <li>Planning: Heal 1 on Gloin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Glorfindel, draw Gladden Fields for net -1 Will,
Threat 28.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: optional engage Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gleowine defending Hill Troll, shodow Wargs for +1, Threat
goes to 33. I'll snare it next round. Denethor defending Dol Guldur
Orcs, shadow Hill Troll for no effect. Lucky! Gloin and Henamarth
kill the orcs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Radagast's Cunning.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gleowine and Forest Snare.</li>
  <li>Quest: Glorfindel, draw Pursued by Shadow, Threat
raised to 38.</li>
  <li>Travel: Gladden Fields.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Scry Necromancer's Reach. Draw Brok Ironfist. (!)</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Longbeard Orc Slayer.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, don't even need to quest next round.</li>
  <li>Quest: nobody. Draw Necromancer's Reach for a "Who cares?"</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Scry Dol Guldur Beastmaster, draw Longbeard

  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<p>I should have quested to clear Gladden Fields.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 17, draw Self-Preservation.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Self-preservation on Gloin. Heal Glordindel.</li>

Cunning to negate the threat, +3 Will and Gladden Fields is clear.</li>

  <li>Encounter: Dol Guldur Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Combat: Denethor defends, shadow Enchanted Stream and The East Bight
for no effect. Gloin swings for 2 puts 1 point of damage. I need six
hits to kill it. Scry Dol Guldur Orcs, draw Self-preservaton.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>

use Gleowine in planning… but I have to draw a Gandalf…
draw Sbowborn Scout. That's the game.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I think this deck can beat this quest. I stalled just a little too
long and should have been chewing away at the Hill Troll all along,
which would have given me a bit more slack a little earlier. That
said, I lucked out getting Gandalf and Forest Snare so early.
The next Gandalf was two cards down, in other words, I would have
drawn it next turn.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
