LotR 151 - We Must Away, Ere Break of Day (11)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Feb 20 2021</time>
<p>Back to the trolls. This quest has been harder than I thought to beat.
I'm using <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/185887">A Hobbit Goes Adventuring
v1.5</a>, which swaps in Erebor
Battle Master for Will of the West.</p>

<p>Opening hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Gondorian Spearman</li>
  <li>Master of the Forge</li>
  <li>Heavy Stroke</li>
  <li>Citadel Plate</li>
  <li>Forest Snare</li>
  <li>Erebor Record Keeper</li>
</ol>

<p>The key thing with this quest is stalling like crazy until getting
a really powerful board state set up.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, Dwarven Tomb</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor Record Keeper</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, Oin, Gimli, draw No Campfire, Doomed 1 for
Threat 28, choose to draw another card: Troll Key. Cool.
Net 1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Troll Camp.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Erebor Battle Master.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, Gimli, draw Wind-Whipped Rain for no
effect. Troll Camp is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor Battle Master, Miner.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, draw Hungry Troll for surge Troll Purse,
net +3 on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Forest Snare and Erebor Battle Master</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, draw Troll Camp, Threat 32.</li>
  <li>Travel: Troll Camp.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I can get the Threat down, I might have a good chance here.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Test of Will, Erebor Record Keeper.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Bilbo, draw Lone Lands for net 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 18, draw Veteran Axehand, Quickstrike.</li>
  <li>Planning: Citadel Plate on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Oin, Bilbo draw More Like a Grocer,
will take the discard resources and save the Test of Will.
This clears Troll Camp, and puts 3 more Progress on quest.
I could clear it next round.</li>
  <li>Travel: Lone Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Burglar Baggin, Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor Record Keeper, Erebor Battle Master,
Gondorian Spearman, Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Bilbo, Erebor RK x 2, draw Hobbit Lands.
This clears the quest, and we get some Trolls out. Large sack
on Gimli, and that's probably the game; Worn sack on Oin.</li>
  <li>Travel: Lone Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Bert, Tom.</li>
  <li>Combat: Quick strike with Erebor Battle Master to swing
for 6, net 4 damage, play Heavy Stroke to get 4 more damage.
Gondorian Spearman defends adding another damage, shadow Cave
Entrance. Miner of the Iron Hills defends, shadow Raost 'Em
or Boil 'Em, Troll Camp back in play.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36 + 2 for 38, keep the trolls out.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think basically I need a Gandalf here or I'm done for.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Unexpected Courage, Erebor Hammersmith.
There is a chance.</li>
  <li>Planning: UC on Bilbo, who removes sacks from Gimli and Oin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Nobody, draw Lone Lands, Threat +10 for 48. Dang.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: William, attach Smelly sack to Erebor Battle Master.
There is still a chance.</li>
  <li>Combat: Erebor Hammersmith defends Tom, shadow Roast 'Em or
Boil 'Em for another Troll Camp but there isn't one. Erebor
is gone. Oin defends Bert, shadow Dreary Hills for no effect,
Oin is dead. Gimli defends William, shadow No Campfire for
+2 Threat which is the game. Dang. I'm going to play it out
to see where it goes. Gimli takes 4 damage. Erebor Battle
Master kills Tom.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 49.</li>
</ol>

<p>Calling it here as I'm location locked.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I'm thinking to add another Gandalf and another Galadhrim's Greetings
to the deck for better threat control. If I can control threat, I can
control when the trolls come out, then take them down one at a time.
Might be good to have Shadow of the Past as well, to help keep the
Troll Camp handy. It's 3 threat though, burly.</p>

<p>I think it's worth keeping a Troll Camp in the staging area pretty
much all the time. It's a good buffer for questing.</p>

<p>Burglar Baggins should be played early to manage questing, it's
cheap and the resources are liable to go to waste otherwise.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
