LotR 156, 157 - Into the Pit 27, 28
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar  7 2021</time>
<p>Game day again, had a work colleague JL over for some Lord of the Rings
LCG. This is becoming more or less a monthly event for us. We're playing
more or less progression style at the cycle level, that is, all of the
Dwarrowdelf cards are in play, despite just going into Khazad-Dum. Too
difficult to deal with deck building otherwise.</p>

<p>Before getting going, we had to build decks. JL went with a
Leadership-Spirit, I went with Tactics-Lore. We spent a fair
bit of time working through his deck. I just pulled a bunch
of cards out of the binder for mine. They both worked pretty
well given the amount of thought going into them.</p>

<h2 id="into-the-pit-27">Into the Pit 27.</h2>

<p>Hero kills on Round 3, Gimli went out. Ugly start. I don't really recall
much of this game.</p>

<h2 id="into-the-pit-28">Into the Pit 28.</h2>

<p>This was a win! And a really long game. We kept getting patrol leader
damage cancelation, which made the game drag on for several more rounds
that it probably should have. The swarm kept getting wrecked, we'd build
a nice tableau, and 2 turns later, down to 1 or 2 allies. We did squeak
it out at the end.</p>

<p>We did figure that my deck needs a bit more resource, and definitely
more card draw. JL's deck was hurting for card draw, really badly.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
