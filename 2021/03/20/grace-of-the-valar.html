<p>From <a href="https://ffg-forum-archive.entropicdreams.com/topic/271926-easy-mode-variant-cycle-campaign-variant/page/1/#comment-3256563">Seastan on the FFG
Forum</a> copied here for converience:</p>

<p>The recent thread by BigKahuna of an easy mode variant reminded me of a
mode of play I had discussed in passing before but never really made
into its own topic. It's meant to serve two purposes:</p>

<p>1) Prevent the frustration of continually losing to the same quest over
and over.</p>

<p>2) Create a campaign style mode of play for the deluxes/cycles.</p>

<h2 id="cycle-campaign-rules">CYCLE CAMPAIGN RULES</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Start with the first quest in a deluxe box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Play through the 9 quests (3 deluxe + 6 cycle) in order, only moving
on when you beat the previous quest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the rules from the the Saga campaign regarding your heroes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Make a list of all heroes you use on the campaign log.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you beat a quest with one or more heroes in your discard pile, they are added to
 the fallen heroes list and cannot be used going forward.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you bring in a new hero (whether because one of your heroes died or
 because you just want to use someone else), add the hero to the campaign
 log. Then you incur a permanent +1 threat penalty at setup going
 forward.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you lose a quest (or scoop), the Valar will step in and assist you
according to your need:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If you lost on or before the 5th round, the group gains 2 Grace of the
 Valar Tokens</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you lost after the 5th round, the group gains 1 Grace of the Valar
 Token</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Keep track of two numbers in the campaign log:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How many Grace of the Valar Tokens the group currently has.</li>
          <li>How many Grace of the Valar Tokens the group earned over the course of
  the campaign.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Redo the same quest.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When beginning a quest, immediately after taking or not taking a
mulligan, each player may perform the below action X times, where X
is how many Grace of the Valar Tokens the group currently has. This
does not consume any Grace of the Valar Tokens.</p>

    <p>Action: Draw 1 card or add 1 resource to the resource pool of a hero
you control.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After beating a quest, reset the number of Grace of the Valar
Tokens the group currently has to 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the campaign, your total score is the number of
   Grace of the Valar Tokens the group has earned over the course of
   the campaign. The lower the score, the better.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="discussion">DISCUSSION</h2>

<p>So the idea here is essentially the Saga rules with an added layer
on top that makes it a bit easier to beat a quest if you've just
lost against it. If you lasted more than 5 rounds against it, then
maybe you just got unlucky and could beat it on the next try, so
you're only given 1 Grace token. If you lost quickly, then 1 Grace
token might not change the result so much, so you're given 2.
Since the total score is dependent on how many Grace tokens you
got, and not the number of losses, there is no incentive to
sacrifice your heroes off early if you think you aren't going to
make it. In fact, it's better for your final score to last into
the 6th round then beat it on the next attempt.</p>

<p>With this mode of play you should never really get stuck on a
quest forever. In the worst case you'll eventually have so many
Grace tokens you can draw your whole deck and play down every card
on the first turn.</p>

<p>When you move to the next quest your Grace tokens go away. They
are only there to help you through the tough quests in the
campaign to save yourself from repeated head-bashing. It also
serves as a way to compare decks against each other, to see which
ones can get through the campaign with less reliance on the Valar.</p>

<p>The advantage of this style of play compared to easy mode is that
you actually get to play with the full encounter deck as designed.
Now, you could combine these rules with easy mode but I don't see
the point. You will eventually be given the tools you need to get
a win.</p>

<p>Finally, one quirk about the standard Saga rules is that if you
lose a hero during a quest, you can simply reset and replay the
quest until you beat it without losing a hero. This removes some
of the tension in each game because there is no real penalty for
doing this. With this mode of play, it will end up impacting your
final score.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
