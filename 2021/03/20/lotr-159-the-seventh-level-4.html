LotR 159 - The Seventh Level (4)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 20 2021</time>
<p>Trying this with Misty Mountains dwarf deck. I haven't played it in
two and a half years, and at that time I play a Dain/Thorin/Ori
deck, which swarms like crazy. This deck is a Gimli/Oin/Ori deck,
which doesn't swarm as well, but we'll see how it works out.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bofur</li>
  <li>Zigil Miner</li>
  <li>Veteran Axehand</li>
  <li>Heavy Stroke</li>
  <li>Quick Strike</li>
  <li>Thror's Map</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't recall enough about this quest to know whether this is
a good hand or not, so I'm playing it.</p>

<p>Encounter: Undisturbed Bones for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Song of Wisdom</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin draw Goblin Spearman net +2 on Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Spearman</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, shadow Goblin Scout for no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Forest Snare.</li>
  <li>Planning: Zigil Miner, Veteran Axehand</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin draw Undisturbed Bones, which deals
2 damage to one ally, which kills them Veteran Axehand.
That hurts. But 4 progress on quest. Spirit resources
are harder than Tactics or Lore right now, so we save
Zigil.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, Goblin Swordsman, goes to staging area.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, draw Underhall, which is Doomed 2 for
Threat 31, no progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Underhall.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends Goblin Sworsdman, shadow Cave Troll
for no effect. Oin defends Goblin Spearman, shadow Goblin
Spearman which goes to staging area. Dang. I'm going to have to
snare one of these.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Erebor Record Keeper, helpful.</li>
  <li>Planning: Forest Snare on Goblin Swordsman. Feels
like a waste, but I'm not getting ahead otherwise. Also
play Erebor Record Keeper to get 5 out.</li>
  <li>Quest: Oin, Ori, Zigil, ERK, draw Upper Hall, net 1 progress.
This is not good.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends Goblin Spearman, shadow Goblin
Spearman which goes into Staging area. Dang. Oin defends
Goblin Spearman, shadow Goblin Archer for no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Erebor Hammersmith and Erebor Battle Master.</li>
  <li>Planning: Song of Wisdom on Oin, Erebor Hammersmith, Erebor
Battlemaster.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, draw Goblin Swordsman. Dang. Threat 35.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Goblin Swordsman, Goblin Spearman.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defend Goblin Swordsman, shadow Goblin Swordsman!
Goes into staging area! WTF! Gimli takes another hit. Oin defends
Goblin Spearman, shadow Goblin Spearman, to the staging area. This
is ridiculuous, I must not have shuffled the Encounter deck well
enough. Erebor Hammersmith defends Goblin Spearman, shadow Watchful
Eyes for no effect takes 1 hit. Erebor Battlemaster defends Goblin
Spearman, shadow Plundered Armory for no effect. Erebor RK exhausts
spend 1 Lore to ready Gimli, 1 Goblin Swordsman down. Five to
go.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Legacy of Durin and Dwarven Tomb.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, draw Goblin Swordsman.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's the game as I have 6 enemies in play, and only 5 defenders.
All the goblins get +2 attack if undefended, so I'm guaranteed to
lose a hero this round. Scoop.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Shuffle the Encounter deck better.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
