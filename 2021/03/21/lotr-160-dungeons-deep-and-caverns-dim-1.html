LotR 160 - Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 21 2021</time>
<p>Next quest! The third and last quest in the first Hobbit box.
I'm playing with the <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/268888">Misty Mountains Grim dwarf
deck</a> which has gotten
through the first two quests. No idea how well it will work
here.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
  <li>Veteran Axehand</li>
</ol>

<p>Lake in the Cavern in the staging area.
(<strong>Note: I forgot to draw an initial encounter card</strong>, already an
asterisk, Also, I attached Sting to Bilbo from the beginning,
which is wrong, it needs to go into the deck. The previous
quest allowed searching the deck for a treasure card, this
quest does not.)</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>And that's the first Hobbit box <em>Over Hill and Under Hill</em>.
I'm going to work through the second Hobbit box before taking
on the Heirs of Numenor.</p>

<p>I made some mistakes, which definitely render this an asterisk win:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did not shuffle my deck between riddles. However, since I did
not do any deck scrying, this has exactly no effect on outcomes,
random is random.</li>
  <li>I did not use the Magic Ring ability to raise threat to do
more progress on 2B. It didn't matter in the end, but I had
threat to spare, some Galadhrim's in hand, and I might have
shortened the game a few rounds had I done that.</li>
  <li>Forgot to loy out an initial encounter card from 1B, just
didn't see it on set up, and I even thought it was weird.
It would not have mattered from the way the encounter played
out through the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
