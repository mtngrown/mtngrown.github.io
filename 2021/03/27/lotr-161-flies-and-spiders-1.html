LotR 161 - Flies and Spiders (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 27 2021</time>
<p>First play of first quest in the second Hobbit box, "Flies and Spiders."
I'm using the <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/268888">Misty Mountains
Grim</a> dwarf deck. This is pretty
much the same deck as A Hobbit Goes Adventuring, but will probably morph
through this next Hobbit box.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Veteran Axehand</li>
  <li>Veteran Axehand</li>
  <li>Veteran Axehand (!)</li>
  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
  <li>Sting</li>
  <li>The Galadhrim's Greetings</li>
</ol>

<p>Since I don't know any better, I'm just going to keep this
hand as-is, I can play Sting right away.</p>

<p>Encounter: Fighting Among Friends which whiffs here.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: Sting on Bilbo, spend a Pipe to
find Orcrist and attach to Bilbo.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin for 4 Will, draw Fat Spider for
net +2 on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Engage Fat Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: undefended, shadow Weighed Down whiffs in this
game state. Gimli takes 2 hits and 1 Venom. Gimli and Bilbo
swing for 8 to kill Fat Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Erebor Record Keeper.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Erebor Record Keeper, Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Ori, Oin, Bilbo, draw Lazy Lob which
put 1 Venom on all questers. Net +5 on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: None, leave it in there. Need to save for
card draw.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Miner of the Iron Hills, Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Quest: I think I need to stall, the Spider's Lair is
nasty, and I don't know when it comes into play. If it
enters during stage 2, I need to be able to power quest
through it. Oin, Ori, draw Hidden Path which results in
Threat 31.</li>
  <li>Travel: Hidden Path.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Unexpected Courage, Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: Erebor Hammersmith, Unexpected Courage on
Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Oin, Ori, draw Old Tom Noddy, Threat 34.
This is nasty, I need to engage these things and get
them out of staging.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Lazy Lob and Old Tomnoddy.</li>
  <li>Combat: Feint on Old Tomnoddy, shadow Dark Bats too bad
no effect. Dwalin defends Lazy Lob shadow Fat Spider defender
gets 1 Poison, Dwalin takes a hit for another Poison. Bummer.
Bilbo and Axehand take out Tomnoddy, Gimli takes out Lazy Lob.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<p>I want to go one more round before clearing Stage 1.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Forest Snare and Dwarven Tomb.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Erebor Hammersmith for 3 Will, draw Caught
in a Web, which is great! It removes Ori from the quest
and clears Hidden Path without putting any progress on
the quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Bilbo's Magic Ring and Zigil Miner.</li>
  <li>Planning: Bilbo's Magic Ring, Erebor Hammersmith,
The Galadhrim's Greetings because I'm getting a little nervous
here. Threat 30.</li>
  <li>Quest: Oin, draw Fat Spider for no progress or threat.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Fat Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Veteran Axehand defends, Shadow Hidden Path for
no effect and no damage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Song of Travel and The Galadhrim's
Greetings. This is cool, because I can generate Spirit
resources via Magic Ring if absolutely necessary.</li>
  <li>Planning: Song of Travel on Bilbo. I can play
Dwarven Tomb to get one of The Galadhrim's Greetings
back from discard. Play both Axehands, just in case.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, one Erebor Hammersmith, draw Fighting
Among Friends, name Spirit for net +3 on quest which
clears Stage 1. Gahâ€¦ Stage 2 does nothing, Stage
is nasty, all resources gone.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Really wish I'd played that next GG on this round, would
have given me a lot more runway.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1, draw Quick Strike, Citadel Plate.</li>
  <li>Planning: Do the Magic Ring thing to ready Gimli.
Threat 33.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo for 4 Will, draw Wicked Spider.
Net +3 progress, which is good.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wicked Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimlu defends, shadow Caught in a Web for no effect.
Poison on to Gimli. Gimli kills Wicked Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2, draw Erebor Record Keeper, The Galadhrim's
Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: Magic Ring thing to ready Oin because I need
Spirit resources badly. Threat 35.</li>
  <li>Quest: Oin, Gimli, draw Crazy Cob. Ready Gimli with UC,
play Quick Strike to take out the Crazy Cob. Net +4 on quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Erebor Record Keeper, Bofur.</li>
  <li>Planning: Magic Ring thing to ready Ori, Threat 37.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Ori, Oin, draw Wicked Spider. Net +5
Progess which clears Stage 3. This brings in Spider's
Lair, which I don't think I care about. I'm going to
be able to quest right past it I'm pretty sure.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wicked Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat:  Bilbo defends Wicked Spider, shadow Crazy Cob
for 1 Poison on Bilbo. Sting puts 2 damage on Wicked Spider
from drawing Dark Bats. Bilbo takes 2 hits, Gimli kills
Wicked Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Heavy Stroke, Dwarven Tomb.</li>
  <li>Planning: Citadel Plate on Gimli, just in case. I don't
think I'll need it, but if I get two enemies out and cannot
clear staging, I'm screwed. This will get me to the next round
almost surely.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Ori, Oin, Bilbo for 10 Will, draw Weighed
Down which reduces Will by 4. But there is only 2 Threat
in Staging, so that's the win*.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Edit: But it's not. I just reread the Stage 4B text, there
is no win if The Spider's Lair is in play. I can't really
justify calling it a win with that big of a miss!)</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This turns out to be a win* because the Quick Strike in Round 9
should not have been played, and that would have taken out
Gimli.</p>

<p>I recalled doing a minor retcon in the first couple of rounds
to prevent a scoop. So maybe this is a win**.</p>

<p>Per the note in Round 11, I'll be playing this one again
to be sure.</p>

<p>More details: A clear loss in several aspects. First, I retconned early
to prevent a probable scoop. Second, I conflated an Action with a
Response for an enemy attacking "When Revealed." A Test of Will
(Response) can handle this situation, Quick Strike (Action) apparently
cannot. Lastly, I didn't clear The Spider's Lair, just quested through,
which doesn't meet the condition on Stage 4B. It may be that questing
before traveling is the smart thing to do, but will still need to travel
and clear The Spider's Lair.</p>

<p>Also, the number of allies in this deck isn't all that helpful given the
shenanigans on Stage 3 and 4 with the unconscious heroes. The main thing
is getting as much will boost as possible so that fewer heroes can quest
for more. For Bilbo, getting the Treasure cards is pretty critical, and
a good use of the extra spend early on. I think I need to sideboard some
will power boosting cards.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
