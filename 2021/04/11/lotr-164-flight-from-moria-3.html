LotR 164 - Flight from Moria (3) with Jump Drive
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 11 2021</time>
<p>Another Game Day at Dos Palmas. From our last play, we were still stuck
in Moria, so this game was all about getting out of there, with Flight
from Moria. This was a quest I beat on my first play a couple of years
ago, and I hadn't played it since.</p>

<p>This quest has a <em>lot</em> of treacheries, with two win conditions. First is
gambling on card draws which are not treacheries, the second is using
Abandoned Tools to "dig out." Last week we gambled on the treacheries,
and lost. There are so many treacheries in this scenario that's not
surprising. With single hand solo, it's probably a better gamble.</p>

<p>For this game, we choose to find Abandoned Tools and "dig" our way out.
The game went on one turn longer than it should have as I forgot about
exhausting the hero with Abandoned Tools, send him (Bifur) questing
instead. On the second turn after, Bifur did not quest, then two
Erebor Record Keepers readied Bifur to finish it off. Good game.</p>

<h2 id="jump-drive-10">Jump Drive 10</h2>

<p>I solidly lost at Jump Drive this game. I hung on to get an alien
military 5 world into play, which put me behind on VPs. While my engine
finally got cranking, I ended up at least a turn behind opponent, maybe
two turns. I ended with ~27 VPs per turn on the table, just wasn't soon
enough, he had his VPs engine already moving. My card draw was excellent
though.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
