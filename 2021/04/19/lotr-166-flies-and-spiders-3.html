LotR 166 - Flies and Spiders (3)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 19 2021</time>
<p>Taking PTO today today to deal with stolen car. Getting it home I think
won't be too much trouble, but I have no idea where to get it fixed. I
probably should not be playing today, but my frustration at work is
pretty intense at the moment.</p>

<p>Anyways, let's get it started.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
  <li>Citadel Plate</li>
  <li>Erebor Record Keeper</li>
  <li>Sting</li>
  <li>Thror's Map</li>
</ol>

<p>Encounter: Old Tomnoddy.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Fast Hitch.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Sting. Spend 1 to look for
Magic Ring and play it.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, draw Great Web, Threat 29.</li>
  <li>Travel: Great Web.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Action, exhaust Magic Ring for 1 Resource, Threat 30.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Veteran Axehand and Erebor Record Keeper. Spend
Pipe to get Orcrist and put on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Erebor Record Keeper, draw Crazy Cob with no
effect from When Revealed as there is no poison at the moment. No
net progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Crazy Cob.</li>
  <li>Combat: Bilbo defends, shadow Wicked Spider for 2 poison, Bilbo
takes no damage. Gimli kills Wicked Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw A Burning Brand and Erebor Record Keeper.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play A Burning Brand on Bilbo.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Erebor Record Keeper, draw Fat Spider for
no net progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Fat Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Bilbo defends, Sting for Fat Spider and 2 hits, shadow
Lazy Lob for no effect, cancel damage with Magic Ring. Gimli and
Axehand kill Fat Spider. Threat 35.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Unexpected Courage and Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: Fast Hitch on Bilbo, Unexpected Courage on Gimli.
Citadel Plate on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Bilbo, Erebor Record Keeper, draw Wicked Spider,
net +3 Great Web is cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wicked Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli defends, shadow Caught in a Web for no effect.
Gimli restores to kill Wicked Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>I should scoop this right here I have not been dealing poisons from
Old Tomnoddy while he's in play. I could take the asterisk, but I'd like
to beat this one a bit cleaner than that.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The Poison mechanism leans towards including 3 of each important card
in the deck, because it's going to be a real problem if certain cards
end up in the discard.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider swapping out Thror's Map, I'm not seeing the use of it yet.</li>
  <li>Consider bringing in The Lucky Number, a Pipe event.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
