Entanglion 1 - get your quantum on
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  9 2021</time>
<p>It's a really slow Saturday hanging around here at Dos Palmas.
The day is turning hot outside, which is kind of early for that sort of
thing in the Bay Area. I'm too spent from work to do a lot, but I did
set up this Entanglion game during the week, and it looks interesting
(and easy) enough to work through a first game.</p>

<p>Entanglion is a coop game, and I'll be playing both sides.</p>

<p>The set up is pretty straightforward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mercurios (blue) on One, draws CNOT, H, X.</li>
  <li>Rubicon (red) on One, draws CNOT, H, X.</li>
</ul>

<p>Red is going first.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays H to move to Minus, draws H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue CNOT to move both to Psi Minus. Draw CNOT. Roll 7
to pass Entanglion Orbital Defenses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red attempts a retrieval, roll 6 for success and pick up
Magnetic Shielding which allow ignoring a first roll in favor
of a second roll for the Entanglion die (d8).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays CNOT as the adjacent spaces have burdensome components.
Blue to One, red to Minus. Draw H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays H to move back to One, draws CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays X to move to Zero, draws H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red exchanges H for SWAP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays H to move to Plus. This fills all the Engine Slots,
so Blue has to play a Quantum Event, draw Schrodinger which increases
the detection rate by 1, now at 2. Bummer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="round-2">Round 2</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays CNOT, travel to Psi Plus, roll 7 to pass defense, draw
SWAP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue does a Retrieve, roll 7, acquire Quantum Programming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays X to move to Phi Plus, roll 3 to pass orbital
defense. Draw X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue retrieves, roll 5 to acquire Quantum Gates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red exchanges SWAP for X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays X to move to Psi Plus, bypass Orbital Defense
with Quantum Programming. Draw H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red exchanges X for CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays H to move to Omega Zero, roll 8 to pass defense.
Draw CNOT. (Note: this is a mistake, this is a Red route, blue cannot
make this move, I'm rolling forward with the game though.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red retrieves, roll 3 to acquire Cubit Interconnect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays SWAP to move to Omega Three, roll 8 to pass defense.
Draw H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red retrieves, roll 1, invoke Magnetic Sheilding to roll 8
acquiring Physical Qubits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue exchanges CNOT for H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays CNOT to move to Omega Two, roll i, invoke Magnetic
Shielding, roll 6 for success. Draw H, and Quantum Event Heisenberg.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="round-3">Round 3</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Blue retrieves, roll 4 to acquire Quantum Error Correction.
Now we have to plan some moves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays the Heisenberg event, roll 4 to land right where I started
from. Bummer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays SWAP to move to Omega Zero, draw CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays X to move to Omega One, roll 2 failing defense, invoke
Magnetic Sheilding and roll 4 to pass defense. Draw Probe, roll 8, no
effect on Detection Rate. Draw CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue retrieves Dilution Refridgeration, roll 5 to acquire, discard
H Engine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red exchanges so that Blue can make the travel to empty planet
without rolling for defense. Exchange CNOT for CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays to move to Psi Minus. Draw H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red exchanges CNOT for H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue exchanges CNOT to find draw SWAP and H, keep H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red exchanges H for H.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue exchanges H for SWAP and CNOT, CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red exchanges H for Probe, roll 6, no effect, draw CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue exchange SWAP for X and X keep X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red swap CNOT for Blue's X, move to Phi Minus, roll 2,
invoke Magnetic Shielding and roll 7, draw CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue retrieves, roll 6 to acquire Control Infrastructure
which wins the game.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I suspect I made more than the one mistake listed above.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Making the game more tense:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Don't allow hanging out on one planet to do a large number of engine
swaps. This might be in the rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shuffle the Probe in from the beginning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put the whole game on a timer such that detection rate goes up every
so often, perhaps 10 moves.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
