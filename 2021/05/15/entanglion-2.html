Entanglion 2
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 15 2021</time>
<p>A second game, where I'm going to read the rules much more closely, and
<em>not</em> give myself the benefit of the doubt. The game is too easy
otherwise, at least the first game was. I also had a lot of successful
die rolls, definitely on the luckier side. For this game, I'm reading
along with the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate">Quantum logic
gate</a> article.</p>

<p>Setting up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blue: first player, starts at 1, engine cards H, H, CNOT.</li>
  <li>Red: starts at 1, engine cards H, H, CNOT.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I really want to do is get to Quantum Error Correction,
but I don't have the engines for that. I could burn some turns
and exchange until I drew an X or CNOT gate, or I could go for
Quantum Programming right away. I think I'll do that.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays H moves to Minus, draw CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays CNOT, move to Psi Minus, defense roll 4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue retrieves, roll 1 to increase detection rate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red retrieves, roll 8 to acquire Quantum Programming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays CNOT to move itself to One and Red to Minus. Draw X
which is excellent!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays H to move to One, draw X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays X to move to Zero, draw SWAP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red exhanges X for X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plasys H moving to Plus draw X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays CNOT to move both to Psi Plus, defense roll 7,
engines track is full draw Bit Flip Error which resets the Detection
Rate to 3. That's an adverse result for me right now, could be
great result if Detection Rate had been really high. Draw CNOT.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="round-2">Round 2</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Blue retrieves roll 5 to acquire Quantum Error Correction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays CNOT to move Red to One and Blue to Plus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue exchanges SWAP for CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red plays CNOT to move to Zero, draw SWAP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue plays CNOT to move both to Phi Plus, defense roll 8,
draw CNOT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red retrives roll 2, fail, Detection Rate moves again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue retrieves roll 2 + 1 for 3, fail, Detection Rate
now 4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red retrieves roll 1, Detection Rate moves again!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue retrives roll 3 + 1 for another fail, detection rate
now 5.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red retrives roll 5, fail, moves again…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue retreives roll 1, fail, now at 6…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red retrieves roll 5, we're about done here…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue retreives roll 3 and that's the game.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This is interesting that a string of bad rolls shut the game down really
fast. I wonder if there is a way to mitigate that? If not, there ought
to be something.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
