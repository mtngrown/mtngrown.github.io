LotR 168 - Flies and Spiders (5)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 16 2021</time>
<p>It's a slow Sunday, and I didn't get a lot of sleep last night, and work
is not going that well overall, so I'm going to see if I can get a few
games in today and tomorrow to see if I can get my head clear. Otherwise
it's just a mass of chores (although I could also do some recreational
programming).</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Boots from Erebor</li>
  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
  <li>Bilbo's Magic Ring</li>
  <li>Dwarven Tomb</li>
  <li>Miner of the Iron Hills</li>
</ol>

<p>Encounter: Caught in a Web, which results in surge Wicked Spider.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Planning: Bilbo's Magic Ring on Bilbo, spend Pipe
find Sting and attach to Bilbo. Boots from Erebor on
Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori to quest, draw Forest Stream, Threat 28.</li>
  <li>Travel: Forest Stream.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wicked Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gimli takes it undefended, shadow Dark Bats which
is attached to Gimli. Gimli take 4 damage, good thing I have
Boots from Erebor on him! Gimli swings for 6 - 1, kills Wicked Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Zigil Miner.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Miner of the Iron Hills, Zigil
Miner, Veteran Axehand. Dark Bats goes away.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Bilbo, Zigil draw Dark Bats, net +3 on
Forest Stream.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dark Bats.</li>
  <li>Combat: Veteran Axehand defends, shadow Old Tomnoddy
for no effect. Because Dark Bats lowers hit points, with 1
damage, Veteran Axehand is done.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Gandalf and Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Veteran Axehand using Oin resource as well.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Bilbo, draw Hidden Path, net +2 progress
clearing Forest Stream, which remove poisons from Gimli.</li>
  <li>Travel: None, leave Forest Path alone as a buffer for
accumulating resources on Bilbo before going to Stage 3.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Bilbo exhaust Ring for resource.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Zigil Miner and Erebor Record Keeper.</li>
  <li>Planning: Erebor Record Keeper.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Zigili, Bilbo draw Giant Web for net +1
progress. All good.</li>
  <li>Travel: Giant Web.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Ring for +1 Resource.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Citadel Plate and Burglar Baggins.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Zigil, Erebor Hammersmith, Erebor Record Keeper,
draw Lazy Lob which poisons all characters committed to quest. Make 1
progress on Giant Web.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Lazy Lob.</li>
  <li>Combat: Veteran Axehand defends Lazy Lob, shadow Lazy Lob for no
effect, Veteran Axehand is killed. Gimli kills Lazy Lob. Ring
for Resource.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 15, draw Quick Strike and Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: Zigil Miner.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Zigil, Erebor Hammersmith draw Old Tomnoddy
for net 0.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Old Tomnoddy.</li>
  <li>Combat: Miner of the Iron Hills defends, shadow Poisones by
Spiders, discard Zigil Miner, Miner of the Iron Hills killed.
But Gimli swings for 6 and takes out Old Tomnoddy. Ring for
Resource.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 18, draw Dwarven Tomb, A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Bilbo, Zigil, Erebor Hammersmith, draw Crazy Cob who attacks
Erebor Hammersmith, shadow Giant Web for no effect, 2 damage on Erebor
Hammersmith. Didn't quite clear Giant Web. I need to get this done next
round.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Crazy Cob.</li>
  <li>Combat: Play Feint, Gimli kills Crazy Cob. Ring for Resource.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<p>Need to bring in Gandalf next round.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 20, draw Quick Strike, Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Gandalf to lower threat to 35.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Bilbo, Gandalf, Zigil, Erebor Hammersmith
draw Hidden Path, net +6 - 2 for Giant Web, play Burglar Baggins
to get +2 which clears Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: Hidden Paths.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<p>I played this really wrong. Stage 3B requires removing <em>all</em> resources
from heroes, so that big bank I built on Bilbo was completely moot, and
now my threat is super high. That's a real bummer. This game will be
over very quickly I'm sure.</p>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1, draw The Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: Ring for Resource, Threat 42. Ready Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, can't afford to, draw Fighting Among Friends
which has no effect right now. Threat 45.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 46.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: Ring for Resource, ready Oin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, draw Caught in a Web, which has to go on Bilbo,
Threat 47, and I'm calling it here.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The next game I think I want to blitz quest through Stage 1 as fast as
possible. I think the key is running the Threat up in Stage 3, use
the Ring to generate Resources during planning phase (or earlier?) if
possible to get the characters conscious.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
