LotR 169 - Flies and Spiders (6)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 22 2021</time>
<p>Probably the last play for this deck before I tech against the quest.
The strategy is to rush Stage 1 as fast as possible, then get the
allies out. Clearing Stage 1 means staging area is also cleared.</p>

<p>Note: this could have, and should, have been a clean albeit long win.
Even in Round 14 when I figured out that I played it wrong, had I plowed
through and just kept playing correctly, I am pretty sure it would have
been a win. The way to have done that would have been to just remove all
the progress from Spider's Glade, and plow through it from there. The
threat would have made it a close call, but I think it was doable and
I wish I had thought of it.</p>

</ol>

<h4 id="round-14">Round 14</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Bofur, which I think will win it
this round as max threat is 3, and all I need to worry
about is a Treachery which removes characters from quest.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Oin, Bilbo, Zigil, draw Giant Web for net +4
whichâ€¦ is not a win as I did not add spiders to the staging
area at the start of the quest phase once Spider's Glade was in
play. Dammit!</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm calling the game here as I'm too far along to attempt
to retcon it accurately.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
