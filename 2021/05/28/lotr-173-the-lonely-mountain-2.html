LotR 173 - The Lonely Mountain (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 28 2021</time>
<p>First play location locked on round 4. Let's try again using the same
deck. I'm not sure the deck can even beat this quest, but it's worth
playing a couple of times to see how it operates.</p>

<p>Initial (mulliganed) hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Protector of Lorien</li>
  <li>Dwarven Tomb</li>
  <li>Veteran Axehand</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
</ol>

<p>Not a really great hand I don't think. At least I can get 2 allies
out next turn, then card draw starting turn 3.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Planning: Bilbo for Magic Ring, and Sting. Threat 28.
Protector of Lorien on Bilbo.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Bilbo for 6 Will, draw Western Slopes, net 0
progress, discard Stand and Fight to make one progress. I can make
a burgle attempt.
    <ul>
      <li>Discard from the encounter deck until a burgle effect is revealed:
Western Slopes: <em>The first player shuffles his deck and reveals
the top card. He may discard 2 cards from his hand that match the
revealed card's sphere</em>.</li>
      <li>Reveal…Gandalf! Try again…Zigil Miner.</li>
      <li>Discard Stand and Fight and Dwarven Tomb. I got some kind of lucky
here, no doubt about it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now the text on Stage 2B states players <em>may</em> (emphasis added) move to
  Stage 3; it doesn't say <em>must</em>. Hence I can stall for a little bit.
4. Travel: Western Slopes.
5. Encounter: none.
6. Combat: none.
7. Refresh: Threat 29.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Song of Travel.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Thror's Golden Cup on Gimli then add to
Victory display and draw Boots from Erebor, Dwarven Tomb, and
Dwalin. Boots from Erebor on Gimli. Play Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Bilbo, draw The Great Hall, Threat 33.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Bilbo, Erebor Hammersmith for 7,
draw Pretending to Sleep, which surges Belching Fire.
For Pretending to Sleep, I'm going to spend 2 Pipe and
stay where I am. Smaug makes an immediate attack on Gimli,
no shadow card, Gimli takes 4 hits. Threat 35.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Zigil Miner x 2.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Zigil Miner and Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Oin, Bilbo, Gimli for 8 Will, draw Known to
an Ounce, which I'm canceling with A Test of Will. Threat 39.
Going into lock.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Miner of the Iron Hills, Quick Strike.</li>
  <li>Planning: Song of Travel on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Ori, Oin, Bilbo, draw Pretending to Sleep, surge
Fighting Among Friends. Spend 2 Pipe to not go to Stage 4; remove
Gimli and Ori from quest, 4 Will against 9 Threat, which results in 45
Threat, and I'm calling it here.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I'm going to need more location control in this deck, even on Turn 2
I'm looking at location lock with 4 threat The Great Hall coming out.
Secret Paths, or Strider's Path would help here, I could swap it with
Western Slopes.</p>

<p>I need Citadel Plate back so Gimli can soak up a couple of rounds of
dragon damage, and deal a bunch of it back out.</p>

<p>This is also looking like Dain needs to be brought in, otherwise just
not getting the quest mojo necessary to stay out of location lock.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
