LotR 175-177 - Road to Rivendell (2-4)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 31 2021</time>
<p>This was a bit of an odd day, as we had to scoop the first two
games, then the third game we decided to discard Sleeping Sentry and Orc
Ambush because both would have been insta-lose. Just no point in that
given we already scooped twice.</p>

<h2 id="game-175">Game 175</h2>

<p>This was a scoop at set up. I was the first player. Set up provided
Chieftain of the Pit and Crebain. With no allies, this was a hero kill
as Chieftain swings for 8 first round out. I was unable to put any
allies out, so we scooped.</p>

<h2 id="game-176">Game 176</h2>

<p>I don't recall exactly what happened in this game, other than another
hero in the first or second turn. I think it was Undisturbed Bones, which
discarded the defending ally for something which had enough attack to
hero-kill undefended. If I recall correctly, I already had damage on
Gimli induced by a card effect.</p>

<p>Here's what I recall: Round 1, Goblin Taskmaster engages first player, 2
hits to Gimli, defend with Veteran Axehand, shadow Undisturbed Bones.
Scoop.</p>

<h2 id="game-177">Game 177</h2>

<p>This game went the distance. Sort of. We got a good ways into the quest,
and Sleeping Sentry came up. We decided to ditch it. It's a stupid card,
insta-lose or induces far too much damage to undo. A few rounds later,
Orc Ambush would have put 7 orcs into staging, all of which would have
engaged that turn. No thank you. We took the win as an easy mode win.
Sleeping Sentry and Orc Ambush are so bad I don't think they can be
redeemed for "normal" decks. Exotic power decks which are out of dwarf
theme might work, couldn't say.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
