HF4A 10 - CEO (3)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  4 2021</time>
<p>Here's the question: can I get industrialized by Turn 22? In previous
games, it has taken me to Turn 23 and 24 respectively. That extra turn
really, really matters. Even better if I could do it by Turn 21. Let's
see it plays out.</p>

<p>Setting up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Randomly drew yellow, and chose Crew (A) which is United Nations
Cosmonauts. I get +2 Aqua at the start. I've never played this crew
before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adding in Module 0 Politics on this round. Might help me get just a
few more VPs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let's go!</p>

<h4 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Photon Kite Sail Thruster</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: roll 6 for Anarchy, no effect.</p>

<h4 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Metastable Helium Thruster, we meet again! This
seems to be a really, really good thruster.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Kuck Mosquite Robonaut.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: roll 2, Inspiration, cycle patents.</p>

<h4 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Free Market Photon Kite Sail, 8 Aqua total. That may have
been a mistake, I could have boosted that for free (mass 0) and it's C
spectral class which matches Mars.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Supercritical Drying Refinery.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Budget Cuts, discard a card from hand to bottom of appropriate
deck. Bummer.</p>

<h4 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Free Electron Laser Robonaut.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Free Market Free Electron Laser, total Aqua 8.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Pad Explosion, no effect.</p>

<h4 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Metallic Hydrogen Reactor.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Free Market reactor total Aqua 11.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Project Orion Reactor.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-11">Turn 11</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Free Market reactor, Aqua total 13.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Inspiration</p>

<h4 id="turn-12">Turn 12</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Tungsten Resistojet Robonaut.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="seniority">Seniority</h4>

<p>There is nothing in the Demand Pile, so all good.</p>

<h4 id="turn-13">Turn 13</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Free Market robonaut, total Aqua 15.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Pad Explosion, no effect.</p>

<h4 id="turn-14">Turn 14</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Solar Pumped MHD robobaut.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-15">Turn 15</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Fund Raise, +1 Aqua and delegate into Centrist
for pad explosion insurance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="turn-16">Turn 16</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Boost everything. I need an X reactor really bad, can't do
anything without it.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-17">Turn 17</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Cermet NERVA reactor, there is an X below it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Glitch for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="turn-18">Turn 18</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Mini-mag RF Paul Trap reactor. 7 Aqua remaining.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-19">Turn 19</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research Mo/Li Heat Pipe Radiator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: pad explosion, robonaut back to hand, +3 Aaua.</p>

<h4 id="turn-20">Turn 20</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Boost. I could be ready to fly, but it's Red Season,
which means Rad rolls get +2. My thruster is Weak Sauce on rad hardness.
This is tough. What I could do is sit out the red season and collect
money so that I'll something to spend after I industrialize.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, need to industrialize by about Turn 18 to get a really good
grip on this scenario.</p>

<p>Sitting it out.</p>

<h4 id="turn-21">Turn 21</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Free Market reactor, total Aqua 9.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Solar Flare, no effect for me. Good thing I decided not to fly.</p>

<h4 id="turn-22">Turn 22</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Fun Raise. Put a delegate into Unity, move the existing
delegate into Honor. 10 Aqua.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-23">Turn 23</h4>

<p>Now is when I need to be really careful. I won't be able to
Industrialize until Turn 24. But I want to spend <em>only</em> the
amount of Aqua I need to get to Mars, and no more. I need that
Aqua back at LEO for Cycle 3.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move: Add 2 Aqua to rocket, +1 for afterburn, 7 Aqua remaining.
Roll for radiation, Radiation roll 2, passed, first aerobrake roll 4,
pass again, second aerobrake roll 6 and I'm landed on Mars with
7 Aqua left in LEO.</li>
  <li>Operation: Prospect, Arsia Mons Caves, can only prospect here but
it's an automatic success. I can do a half burn to the North Pole
next turn maybe, depending on what gets decommissioned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: pad explosion for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="turn-24">Turn 24</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Industrialize.</li>
  <li>Free Action: Colonize.</li>
  <li>Free Action: Cargo Transfer, decommission everything back to hand.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="seniority-1">Seniority</h4>

<p>KPIs: 8.
VPs: 12.</p>

<p>Continue play.</p>

<p>For the next cycle, I'm going to try and get everything I can ET
Produced on Mars, then go there and pick it up.</p>

<h4 id="turn-25">Turn 25</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: ET Produce UltraCold Neutrons reactor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Glitch for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="turn-26">Turn 26</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Boost thruster and refinery.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-27">Turn 27</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Research H2O2 fuel cell.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: pad explosion, drat. I can't afford that right now.</p>

<h4 id="turn-28">Turn 28</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: ET Produce Generator.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-29">Turn 29</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: ET Fuel produciont, 7 Aqua on site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Glitch, put it on Outpost 2.</p>

<h4 id="turn-30">Turn 30</h4>

<p>Going into Red Season.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Delivery roll for glitch, no effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-31">Turn 31</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: ET Produce robonaut.</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Solar Flare, I'm good.</p>

<h4 id="turn-32">Turn 32</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Boost. I have 1 Aqua remaining. I don't think I can do this
as I am going to end up needing to move to a different part of Mars to
do the prospecting, and I just don't have enough Aqua to get there and
do that. I would have an awesome stack if I could. Again, I'm like 1-2
turns from pulling it off. Bummer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
