<p>After almost a year and a half, my usual Vietnam opponent ventured up to
Dos Palmas for game day. He wanted to do something Vietnam, but I didn't
really have much on my mind for that at the moment. We ended up going
through some of the boxes of my Vietnam games, and the Game Science
<em>Viet Nam</em> struck our fancy, so we set it up! I was stoked to get this
back on the table. I believe there is a pretty good game in here,
especially since it's from 1965!</p>

<p>We played 3 rounds, January through March, then called it a draw. As I
recalled, the game is pretty cool. He liked it as well. He's even
interested in redoing the map in Autocard, which would be pretty cool.
If he does that, I'll spring for a bunch of wooden bits from
Speilematerial.de to upgrade all the components. I'm also going to keep
the game out and the rules handy to see if I can answer some of the
following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How do the numbers on the side of the index tracks work? Supposedly
these are for controlling the number of Insurgent and Counter
Insurgent pieces, but the start of the game says to fill all the
spaces. This is ambiguous.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How are attackers and defenders established? We did not find anything
in the rules to define what constitutes an attacker versus a
defender. This is a problem as combat resolution depends on the
difference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many different ways are reinforcement units brought in and for
which sides? The index track for sure, Infiltration for the VC, but
there has to be other ways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do Irregular forces get emplaced for each side?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the game set up in Turn 1:</p>

<p>I'm writing this on December 12, 2021, months after the fact.
I very distiinctly recall playing this, but I did not log it at the
time, but I'm pretty sure it was after this game. It's such a great
game! Would like to play it more.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
