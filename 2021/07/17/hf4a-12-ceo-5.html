HF4A 12 - CEO (5)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul 17 2021</time>
<p>Another round of CEO, this time with some modifications to the rules as
written. Namely, I'm going to keep it at 1 Aqua to select patents, and
I'm going to pull supports as well. I'm going to play with Module 0
politics, so will be going 5 rounds. I have several goals for this game:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get 3 different spectral factories work so that production
can move from LEO.</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal for the game is getting 3
different spectral type factories working, and getting most production
moved out of LEO. That is, having mostly black cards in play.</p>

<p>I'm playing the ESA Space Unionists this game, crew F with the powersat
privilege.</p>

<p>Note: this game started on July 12, 2021.</p>

<h4 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h4>

<p>Operation, Research:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nuclear Drill Robonaut</li>
  <li>D-T Gun Fusion Reactor</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Pad explosion for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h4>

<p>Operation, Research:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Black body Pumped Laser Robonaut</li>
  <li>Mini-Mag RF Paul Trap Reactor</li>
  <li>Magnetocaloric Refrigerator Radiator</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h4>

<p>Operation, Boost Black Body robonaut to LEO.</p>

<p>Event: Glitch for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h4>

<p>Operation, Free Market: Mini-Mag Reactor.</p>

<h4 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h4>

<p>Operation: Research: Heat Sink Fountain Radiator.</p>

<p>Event: Budget Cuts, discard Nuclear Drill Robonaut.</p>

<h4 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h4>

<p>Operation, Research: Photon Heliogyra Thruster.</p>

<h4 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h4>

<p>Free Action: discard Magnetocaloric Radiator.</p>

<p>Operation, Research:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Project Orion Reactor</li>
  <li>Dialetric X-ray Window</li>
</ul>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<p>I am not doing well at this game so far, I'm really thrashing around
trying to figure out what my plan is going to be.</p>

<h4 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h4>

<p>Last turn's research was a waste given the Inspiration event turned up
the Ablative Plate thruster, which I intend on using. Hence, going
to free action discard back to 3 cards.</p>

<p>Free Action: discard Project Orion and Dialetric X-ray Window.</p>

<p>Operation, Research: Ablative Plate thruster.</p>

<p>This is a good one as it will synergize really well with DT-Gun Fusion
reactor.</p>

<h4 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h4>

<p>Operation: Boost Photon Heliogyra, thruster and reactor.</p>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h4>

<p>Operation: Research Basalt Fiber Spinning Refinery.</p>

<p>I now have a stack which can get me all over the place. I just need to
be able to fuel it now.</p>

<p>I can get to the Karin Cluster with two burns using the Venus Flyby,
except I don't have the right generator. Crap. I'm going to see about
milling the patent deck for one. Crap. I can collect monies though.
Gonna wait until next turn to avoid the belt roll penalty.</p>

<p>Free Action: build a rocket with the Photon Heliogyra and the Crew card.
It has mass 1, which gives +2 thrust, plus Powersat for another +1
thrust, total 3 thrust. Should be immune to belt rolls as long as
it's not flying in Red season.</p>

<h4 id="turn-11">Turn 11</h4>

<p>Movement: Burn through Cycler -&gt; GEO -&gt; L2 -&gt; Venus Flyby -&gt; Earth Ring
Burn -&gt; Mars Ring Burn -&gt; Yarkowsky Swarm (roll FINAO 3) -&gt; Karin B.
This yeilds the Ceres Glory chit.</p>

<p>Operation, Research: Atomic Layer Deposition refinery and Cascade
Thermoacoustic Generator.</p>

<p>Event: 5, Anarchy, faction privilege suspended, which sucks real bad as
I don't have a way to get home now. Purge roll 1.</p>

<h4 id="turn-12">Turn 12</h4>

<p>Operation, Fund Raise, delegate to Centrist. Seniority disk to Honor.</p>

<p>Free Action: Decommission, new Crew in LEO, will need to Boost the sail.
This really sucks, it's going to cost a turn, maybe 2 turns to get
boosted and back underway.</p>

<h4 id="seniority">Seniority</h4>

<p>Board Meeting: need 0, have 0, all good.</p>

<h4 id="turn-13">Turn 13</h4>

<p>Operation, Boost: Sail.</p>

<p>Movement: LEO to Didymos is 2 burns, land for Glory chit.</p>

<p>Event: roll 5 Anarchy, whatever, already there.</p>

<h4 id="turn-14">Turn 14</h4>

<p>Operation: Fund Raise, move Active Law to Freedom.</p>

<p>Movement: Move to L4.</p>

<h4 id="turn-15">Turn 15</h4>

<p>Operation, Free Market, sell 2 cards for 5.</p>

<p>Movement: crew back to LEO, Glory chit flipped.</p>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="turn-16">Turn 16</h4>

<p>Operation, Research refinery and reactor.</p>

<p>Movement: 3 burns gets me to Apophis.</p>

<p>Free Action: Glory chit.</p>

<h4 id="turn-17">Turn 17</h4>

<p>Movement: From Apophis back to LEO, glory chit flips. 5 VPs
and I'll need 8 to survive the board meeting. Just making some claims
should be able to do it, provided I get the next chit.</p>

<p>Operation, Research: refinery and generator.</p>

<p>Event: Budget cuts.</p>

<h4 id="turn-18">Turn 18</h4>

<p>Free Action: discard Refinery.</p>

<p>Operation, Research: Ericsson Engine generator.</p>

<p>Movement: I can get to Hathor in 3 burns and a pivot,
roll 6 for hazard, all good.</p>

<p>Free Action: Glory chit.
Free Action: Cargo Transfer, outpost on Hathor.</p>

<h4 id="turn-19">Turn 19</h4>

<p>Operation: Fund Raise, delegate to Honor, Law to Centrist.</p>

<p>Event: Solar Flare, no effect for me at the moment.</p>

<h4 id="turn-20">Turn 20</h4>

<p>Operation: Boost, pay 5.</p>

<p>Free Action: Outpost on Hathor to rocket.</p>

<p>Movement: Hathor to Leo, 4 burns, Glory chit flips.</p>

<h4 id="turn-21">Turn 21</h4>

<p>Fund Raise: +4 Aqua.</p>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="turn-22">Turn 22</h4>

<p>Free Action: Cargo Transfer, fuel up.</p>

<p>Movement: Move to the Hohmann next to Vesta.</p>

<h4 id="turn-23">Turn 23</h4>

<p>Movement: Vesta Family Lagrange.</p>

<p>Operation, Prospect: Vesta is successful of course, roll <del>5</del> 4 for
Eichsfeldia.</p>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<p>Rant: In all the games I've played of High Frontier, either 3rd Edition
or 4th Edition, I cannot recall ever passing a size roll. Not ever, not
even once.</p>

<h4 id="turn-24">Turn 24</h4>

<p>Movement: Land on Eichsfeldia.</p>

<p>Operation: Industrialize.</p>

<p>Free Action: Colonize.</p>

<h4 id="seniority-1">Seniority</h4>

<p>Board Meeting: 1 disk down, need 8 KPIs, have 22, so I'm clear for the
next year. The follow on target is going to be 30 with 3 disks on Year
48, which I should be able to get with Industrialiing Vesta. Then it's
going to get a bit harder. I'm going to put all the Seniority disks
on Honor, this will help VP count.</p>

<p>For the next cycle, I want to be in position to Industrialize/Colonize
Vesta. I'm going to need 30 VPs to pass the next meeting, and that will
do it. For the last cycle I need 44 by the end of the last cycle, which
would produce a win.</p>

<p>It's going to be interesting to see how this works as the number of
Factories goes up, the number of Delegates will be limited.</p>

<p>I can play the solo rules to get a free boost, which is important for
needing to boost 9 mass. That would take most of a cycle to accumulate.
Free boost is Individuality, so I need to do a Fund Raise and move the
Active Law that direction. I'll get some Aqua out of it though, which is
good.</p>

<p>Sequence:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fund Raise, move AL to Individuality.</li>
  <li>Boost, Lobby in case of Pad Explosion.</li>
  <li>Can it be fueled and move on this turn? What happens if Anarchy?
I'll lose 1 thrust from Powersat Faction privilege. Will this matter? It
would put me behind one or two turns.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="turn-25">Turn 25</h4>

<p>Operation: Fund Raise, delegate to Individuality, Active Law to
Individuality.</p>

<p>Event: Anarchy, no PowerSat, purge 6 which is Individuality. That
sucks, will need to do another Fund Raise.</p>

<p>Rereading 03. Law Activation, I think I misplayed it above, so the
upshot is about the same, I'll be able to boost next turn.</p>

<h4 id="turn-26">Turn 26</h4>

<p>Operation: Fund Raise, 1 Aqua, delegate to Individuality, Active
Law to Individuality.</p>

<h4 id="turn-27">Turn 27</h4>

<p>Operation, Boost: almost all of it.</p>

<p>Free Action: Cargo Transfer, build rocket.
Free Action: Fuel with 2 Aqua.</p>

<p>Movement to Hohmann next to Vesta.</p>

<p>Event: Pad Explosion, Photon Heliogyra back to hand.</p>

<h4 id="turn-28">Turn 28</h4>

<p>Movement: 1 Burn to Vesta Family Lagrange.</p>

<p>Free Action: Cargo Transfer to split the rocket, build Outpost 2
with thruster and Radiator.</p>

<p>Operation, Boost: sail.</p>

<h4 id="turn-29">Turn 29</h4>

<p>Movement: Land on Vesta.</p>

<p>Operation, Industrialize.</p>

<p>Free Action: Build Colony.</p>

<p>Event: Budget Cuts, discard Photon Tether Rectenna.</p>

<h4 id="turn-30">Turn 30</h4>

<p>Right now I have 32 VPs. I need 44 to get through the next cycle
after this one. I can get 12 with another colony and Glory chit,
as long as it's a new spectral type. I'm going to to Ganymede,
spectral type S. I'm going to do it by building C and V cards
and flying them out from Vesta, if possible.</p>

<p>Free Action: discard refinery and generator.</p>

<p>Operation, Research: ISRU Sabatieur refinery.</p>

<h4 id="turn-31">Turn 31</h4>

<p>Free Action: decommission Outpost 2.</p>

<p>Operation: ET Produce thruster.</p>

<p>Event: Pad Explosion sail to hand.</p>

<h4 id="turn-32">Turn 32</h4>

<p>The black cards are a whole new game.</p>

<p>Operation: Boost everything to LEO, free in Individuality.</p>

<h4 id="turn-33">Turn 33</h4>

<p>Operation, Research: Rankine Generator.</p>

<p>Event: Glitch on Vesta thruster.</p>

<h4 id="turn-34">Turn 34</h4>

<p>Operation: Research: In Core Thermionic Generator.</p>

<h4 id="turn-35">Turn 35</h4>

<p>Operation, Research: Salt-cooled Reflux radiator.</p>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="turn-36">Turn 36</h4>

<p>Operation, Factory-Refuel: Vesta.</p>

<h4 id="seniority-2">Seniority</h4>

<p>This next cycle is going to be chancy.</p>

<p>With 5 Thrust, I can get to Titan in 2 turns, and I really need to
do this before Red season starts.</p>

<p>I have 12 turns left: Here are the operations I need to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 Delivery Operations.</li>
  <li>1 Boost</li>
  <li>2 Fund Raise</li>
</ul>

<p>But I could lobby to net +3 FTs right now.</p>

<p>In order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Delivery, as there is a glitch trigger on this, but the
it's <code>8 Rad-Hard</code>, so that's not an issue. Then do a Lobby
operation on Honor to net +3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boost and move to Lagrange Burn before Jupiter Flyby.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fund Raise into Centrist, move delegate to Honor, move
Active Law to Honor. Free Actions?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now I need to Fund Raise 3 times for FINAO. This is fine as I can fly in
the Saturn Zone during Red season without worrying about Rad-Hardness,
all of my components will pass the roll automatically. This means I can
stop on a Hohmann and Fund Raise until I have enough FT to pass FINAO.</p>

<p>The last thing is whether the event roll goes into Anarchy which would
cost me a whole turn of movement. I could do a fund raise on that and
Lobby Pad Explosion if it happens.</p>

<h4 id="turn-37">Turn 37</h4>

<p>Operation, Delivery: Ablative Nozzle thruster to LEO.</p>

<p>Event: Anarchy, exactly the result I did not want. No big
deal, I'll just Fund Raise next turn instead, and hope I don't get a Pad
Explosion. Purge roll <del>2</del> 3. (I think this wouldn't have
mattered in the end, I should have had enough slack to be able to
get all the way to Titan in time to build a colony.</p>

<h4 id="turn-38">Turn 38</h4>

<p>Operation: Boost.</p>

<p>Free Action: Lobby, pay 1 to net +3 Aqua.
Free Action: Cargo Transfer build rocket and fuel. Thrust is 3 + 1
Reactor + 1 PowerSat + 1 Afterburn - 1 Transport class = 5. This is
actually 5 Thrust per Anarchy loss of Faction Privilege.</p>

<p>I could move this turn, but it wouldn't benefit me, and I'm not risking
a pad explosion until next turn, so no big deal.</p>

<h4 id="turn-39">Turn 39</h4>

<p>Operation, Fund Raise: delegate to Honor, move Active Law to Honor.</p>

<p>Movement: move to Lagrange Burn right before Jupiter on the green line.
Earth belt roll 1 - 5 thrust = -4 &lt; all rad hardness. Good to go.</p>

<p>Event: Glitch, no effect.</p>

<h4 id="turn-40">Turn 40</h4>

<p>Movement: I need to move somewhere where I can hang out and build
Aqua for FINAO. This would be the second green Hohmann past the Jupiter
Flyby.</p>

<p>Operation, Fund Raise: 7 Aqua total.</p>

<h4 id="turn-41">Turn 41</h4>

<p>Movement: Advance to next Hohmann.</p>

<p>Operation: Fund Raise: 11 Aqua total.</p>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="turn-42">Turn 42</h4>

<p>Operation, Fund Raise: 15 Aqua total.</p>

<p>Movement: 2 burns through next Hohmann, which is the last Hohmann before
Saturn, then 2 belt rolls 1, 3 both pass, 12 Aqua for FINAO and land on
Titan site Ontario Lacus. Here's a photo from Wikipedia:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier-4/ceo/PIA16166_Ontario_Lacus.jpg" alt="Ontario Lacus" /></p>

<p>Note: Because Titan is an Atmospheric site, the Raygun cannot Prospect
from the adjacent site <code>LTO</code>.</p>

<h4 id="turn-43">Turn 43</h4>

<p>Operation, Prospect: automatic claim for Titan's size.</p>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="turn-44">Turn 44</h4>

<p>Operation, Industrialize: Factory on Titan.</p>

<p>Free Action: Build Colony on Titan. Victory Points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9 for stuff on the map</li>
  <li>24 for Factories</li>
  <li>7 Glory</li>
  <li>3 Delegates</li>
  <li>1 Astrobiology</li>
  <li>total: 44</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding a rocket is 45 getting past the last Board Meeting for a win.</p>

<p>Not sure what I want to do at this point. Maybe make more black cards.
While I just Industrialized a D site, there aren't any D cards at the
top of the patent deck at the moment. Maybe prospect some S sites.</p>

<p>In any case, decommission everything.</p>

<h4 id="turn-45">Turn 45</h4>

<p>Operation, ET Produce thruster on Vesta.</p>

<p>Event: Solar Flare for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="turn-46">Turn 46</h4>

<p>Operation, ET Produce Radiator on Eichsfeldia.</p>

<p>I have this nagging suspicion that I should be doing Free
Actions as well, but I can't think of anything I could do.</p>

<h4 id="turn-47">Turn 47</h4>

<p>Operation, Factory-Refuel on Eichsfeldia.</p>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="turn-48">Turn 48</h4>

<p>Operation, Delivery: thruster to LEO.</p>

<h4 id="seniority-3">Seniority</h4>

<p>As noted above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9 for stuff on the map</li>
  <li>24 for Factories</li>
  <li>8 Glory</li>
  <li>3 Delegates</li>
  <li>1 Astrobiology</li>
  <li>total: 45</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I only needed 30, I'm good to go. For the last cycle, I'm going
to attempt the Uranus Aerostat. I should be able to do it.</p>

<h4 id="turn-49">Turn 49</h4>

<p>Operation, Fund Raise: 8 Aqua total.</p>

<p>Event: Inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="turn-50">Turn 50</h4>

<p>Operation, Fund Raise: 12 Aqua total.</p>

<h4 id="turn-51">Turn 51</h4>

<p>Operation: Delivery radiator.</p>

<p>Event: Pad explosion, don't care, decommission the Sail.</p>

<h4 id="turn-52">Turn 52</h4>

<p>Operation, Boost: everything, costs 4.</p>

<p>Free Action: assemble rocket, charge afterburner.
Free Action: fuel with 3 tanks.
Dry mass 5. Wet mass 8.</p>

<h4 id="turn-53">Turn 53</h4>

<p>Operation: Fund Raise.</p>

<p>Free Action: Fuel to wet mass 11.</p>

<p>Movement: Green band through Jupiter Flyby.</p>

<p>Event: Budget Cuts.</p>

<h4 id="turn-54">Turn 54</h4>

<p>Operation: Fund Raise.</p>

<p>Move: Towards Neptune now.</p>

<h4 id="turn-55">Turn 55</h4>

<p>Operation: Fund Raise.</p>

<p>Move: continue on zig zags.</p>

<p>Event: Solar Flare, don't care too far from Sun.</p>

<h4 id="turn-56">Turn 56</h4>

<p>Operation: Fund Raise.</p>

<p>Move: I get 8 burns total which lets me land on the
aerostat. Sadly, I can't claim it as I don't have low
enough ISRU, and I can't even refuel here. This was a bad
trip.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I could move the other way and prospect
some smaller sites, which all busted on me, because I don't
believe I've ever had a successful prospect roll.</p>

<p>In any case, I get the glory chit for landing, and I'll leave
the rocket on the map, and just Fund Raise until the game
runs out.</p>

<p>Calling the game here as a win with 47 VPs.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This is definitely an asterisk win. I modified a Prospect roll and a
Purge roll because I want to see how the game plays out with black
cards and operating in the zones past the Ceres Zone. Also, I did
the 1 Aqua for patent with supports. That said, I think I'm getting
enough of the hang of it where I can plan around bad luck rolls, or
even remediate when they happen.</p>

<p>It seems to me that once a basic, workable rocket stack is put together,
it's not terribly difficult to refine it as you go.</p>

<p>Here's the stacks I used:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier-4/ceo/g12-white-stack.jpg" alt="White stack" /></p>

<p>This stack weighs in at 5 mass, producing 6 thrust with 1/2 step of fuel
for each burn. It does need a powersat to push, but it's still pretty
healthy 5 thrust without it.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/high-frontier-4/ceo/g12-black-stack.jpg" alt="Black stack" /></p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.

Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>

<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."

This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
