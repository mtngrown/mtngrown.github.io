The Dark Sands and 1955 The War of Espionage
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 15 2021</time>
<p>Last year, my usual hex and counter opponent sent a superb color copy of
the rules and playbook for <em>The Dark Sands</em>, Raicer's North Africa chit
pull game. I've heard about it, and at one point had it on the
publisher's pre-order list (GMT P500). For whatever reason, I decided
not to back the game. In any case, he has it and brought it over today
so we could get some hex and counter goodness. Between the 'rona, work,
and other games, we haven't had hex and counter on the table in quite
a while.</p>

<p>After spending an hour going over various games, new or otherwise
unplayed (show and tell), we set it up. It took about 90 minutes for the
first set up, this is from a cold start. Our mission was to complete
the first scenario, that being the 2 turn Operation Compass, whereby the
Commonwealth kicks the Italians out of Egypt.</p>

<p>I took the Italians, he took the Commonwealth. Since I've played
Operation Compass twice in OCS, I already knew what I needed to do,
which was to pull back as fast as possible to set up a defense in depth
around Tobruk, and let the ZOCs act as speed bumps while his CW chewed
away. I was successful, and managed to keep a couple of units in Egypt
to win.</p>

<p>After that he introduced a small card game called <em>1955 The War of
Espionage</em>, and proceeded to trounce me! He left the game with so I
could learn the rules better, we'll play it again. It's nice to have a
game I don't own. It goes away on it's own!</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
