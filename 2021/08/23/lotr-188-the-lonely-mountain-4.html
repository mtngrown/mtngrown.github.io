LotR 188 - The Lonely Mountain (4)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Aug 23 2021</time>
<p>Back for another attempt at <em>The Lonely Mountain</em>. I'm thinking I'm
going to rebuild my current (<a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/268888">Misty Mountains
Grim</a>) deck to beat this one. I've
lost pretty badly with this deck on the first three plays.</p>

<p>For this play I have my binders out and will build a sideboard as I
play.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
  <li>Sting</li>
  <li>Zigil Miner</li>
  <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
  <li>Protector of Lorien</li>
  <li>Feint</li>
</ol>

<p>Not too bad, I'll keep it.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Sting on Bilbo, spend 1 R from Bilbo to
get Magic Ring on him.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, Ori, Oin for 6 Will, draw Fighting Among Friends.
I choose Spirit reducing to 4 Will, which is net +1 Progress. Since I
quested successfully, I need to make a burgle attempt. From the
Encounter deck draw Dragon Spell, Known To An Ounce which has
<em><strong>Burgle</strong> The First player shuffles his deck and reveals the top
card. He may discard 1 card from his hand which matches the revealed
card's sphere and cost</em>. Draw Zigil Miner, and discard Zigil Miner from
my hand (bummer). Draw Thror's Golden Cup, attach to Bilbo, move to
Victory Display and draw Veteran Axehand, Unexpected Courage, and
Zigil Miner. This is interesting.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also just figured out I made a mistake here: a successful burgle
provides the option to advance to Stage 3. I did not do that here.
Which is probably a good thing as I would have lost a hero to
Smaug The Magnificent. Better to wait until getting some allies out.</p>

<p>This is where I want to fail questing repeatedly and control Threat
via other means.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Erebor Hammersmith, Zigil Miner, Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, Ori, Oin, draw Hidden Path for net +4 Threat: 32.</li>
  <li>Travel: Use Magic Ring to get a Resource (Threat 33) and travel
to Hidden Paths.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Stand and Fight and Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, Ori, Oin for 6 Will, draw Desolation of Smaug.
Because Hidden Path is active, we can take 1 from Threat of each
location yielding Threat 36. This is not good, we're looking at
location lock now.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Dwarven Tomb and A Burning Brand.</li>
  <li>Planning: Unexpected Courage on Gimli.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Ori, Oin, Bilbo for 8 Will, draw Dragon Spell to
put on Gimli. This could actually be pretty cool, as Gimli can power
up by spending resources and not having to risk getting attacked.
Net +1 Threat for 38.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw A Test of Will and Orcrist.</li>
  <li>Planning: Orcrist on Gimli, Protector of Lorien on Bilbo.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Ori, Oin, Bilbo for 8 Will, draw The Great
Hall. I think I'm in location lock. Let's count it up: Smaug for 3,
The Lonely Mountain for 4, Desolation of Smaug for 3, and Great Hall
for 4, total: 14 - 3 (Hidden Path) = 11, Threat 42. I can discard 3
to Protector of Lorien but that won't clear Hidden Path. I'm going to
let the Threat in the unlikely case I get a chance to burgle again.
This keeps my hand full of cards.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Song of Travel and Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: Song of Travel on Gimli, play Dwalin. I could at this point
play Galadhrim's, but I still have enough mojo to clear the location
lock. I should scoop here, but I'm not going to.</li>
  <li>Quest: Gimli, Ori, Oin, Bilbo, draw Belching Fire induces a dragon
attack, we'll say it's on Zigil Miner. Going to scoop now.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This wasn't a bad game at all. I'm feeling a lot more comfortable with
this quest now. I can see that it's beatable, the key is balancing the
threat increase with the ability to choose when to advance to Stage 3.
The non-Burglar increase Smaug gets makes this quite tricky.</p>

<p>I really need the questing power I get from Dain, so I'm considering
rebuilding the Deeds of Dwarves deck. Dain also buffs the attack power
which would be super useful against Smaug in Stage 3.</p>

<p>Sideboard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Lucky Number, which should combo really well with Protector of
Lorien on Bilbo. I could have used this in Turn 5 to clear Hidden
Path.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
