LotR 190 - The Lonely Mountain (5)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 13 2021</time>
<p>I've been spanked too many times with the Misty Mountains deck, so I
decided to rebuild the <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/87270">Deeds of Dwarves
deck</a> to see if I can get any
better results on this quest. As it turns out, this deck is very
thematic having Thorin, Dain, and Ori as heros!</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dwarven Tomb</li>
  <li>Erebor Record Keeper</li>
  <li>Durin's Song</li>
  <li>Longbeard Map Maker</li>
  <li>King Under the Mountain</li>
  <li>Narvi's Belt</li>
</ol>

<p>This isn't that great of an initial hand, but it's not that bad either,
maybe 4 out of 5. Having Narvi's Belt available right away is excellent,
but it would have been nice to have another playable ally.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Erebor Record Keeper. Spend a pipe to find Bilbo's
Magic Ring, exhaust that to find Sting. Threat 32. Attach Narvi's Belt to Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: skipped on first round this scenario.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Ancestral Knoweledge.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Longbeard Map Maker.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo only, draw Great Hall for Threat 37.</li>
  <li>Travel: Great Hall.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is wicked, looking threat out really fast, but I need to have my
hand full of cards to pass the Burgle test.</p>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Gloin and Longbeard Orc Slayer.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Gloin and give two Resource to Thorin. Play
Ancestral Knowledge to clear Great Hall. Exhaust Narvi's Belt
to play Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, draw Desolation of Smaug, threat 41.</li>
  <li>Travel: Desolation of Smaug.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<p>I need to pack my hand full of cards.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Bifur, Longbeard Map Maker.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play King Under the Mountain on Dain. Play Bifur and
draw Fili and Untroubled By Darkness. Exhaust King Under the Mountain,
discard Miner of the Iron Hills, Gandalf to hand.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, Ori, draw Fighting Among Friends which doesn't increase
threat but does trigger Burgle, which I was hoping to postpone at least
one more turn. I'm going to name Spirit and take the 2 Progress onto
Wasteland to attempt to clear it. Burgle: Shuffle deck and reveal top
card: Second Breakfast Event matched by Durin's Song and Dwarven Tomb.
Burgle is successful, steal The Arkenstone, which I probably won't play
as my threat is already too high. Whatever. Advance to Stage 3.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Smaug is automatically engaged.</li>
  <li>Combat: Erebor Record Keeper defends, shadow Hidden Path for no
effect. Attack with everyone, net +5 damage on Smaug.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Erebor Record Keeper, King Under the Mountain.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Fili and Kili, Gandalf to put 4 hits on Smaug. Exhaust
King under the Mountain to discard Henamarth River and play Cram on Thorin.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thorin, Bilbo, Longbeard Map Maker, Gloin, Fili for 12 Will,
draw Western Slopes which is a successful quest without progress and
which will put me into location lock. Burgle: Belching Fire, need to
discard only one match type, draw Unexpected Courage and match with The
Arkenstone to attach A Bare Patch to Smaug.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dwalin defends against Smaug, shadow has Burgle, so Dwalin is
killed, shadow Dragon Spell for no effect, Kili is killed. Discard Cram
to ready Thorin, attack with Gandalf, Bifur, Thorin and Ori for 14, add
9 hits to Smaug who now has 18 damage. I have this game next turn.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 44.</li>
</ol>

<p>Had I gone all in on questing this turn, I would have beaten it.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Bifur, Longbeard Orc Slayer.</li>
  <li>Planning: Exhaust King Under the Mountain to discard Narvi's Belt and
retain Erebor Hammersmith. Play Erebor Record Keeper.</li>
  <li>Quest: All in: Ori, Thorin, Bilbo, Longbeard Map Maker, Gloin, Erebor
Record Keeper, Fili, Bifur for 18 Will, draw Known to an Ounce,
discard Longbeard Map Maker and Longbeard Orc Slayer. Net progress is 5,
which clears the Desolation of Smaug, put 4 Progress on the quest, which
is more than Smaug's 2 remaining hit points, so that's the win.</li>
</ol>

<p>I made a technical error on this turn: I should have played Untroubled
by Darkness as this is my last hand anyway. Otherwise I would have
risked losing it through the Known to an Ounce treachery, which could
have made a difference in a game where the progress requirement was
tighter.</p>

<p><strong>MAJOR ERROR: I was supposed to remove Smaug from play once the quest
progress exceeded remaining hit points. It would have been a win anyway
as I would have played Ancestral Knowledge to place 11 Progress this
round, then all in on the next round would have taken it easily.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MAJOR ERROR 2: Smaug is immune to player card effects, so the 4 direct
damage dealt by Gandalf doesn't count. I'm pretty sure I could still
have pulled this one out, but it might have taken one more round.</strong></p>

<p>Upshot: I need to replay the quest. Bummer.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
