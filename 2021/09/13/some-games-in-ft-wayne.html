Some games in Ft Wayne
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 13 2021</time>
<p>Rather than do a blog-post-per-game, I'm collecting a few days
worth of plays into this post. The games are also <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/plays/bydate/user/mtngrown/subtype/boardgame">recorded on
BGG's chronological
plays</a>.</p>

<p>This is in rough order of appearance, going from memory.</p>

<p><strong>Wingspan</strong> came about as I was attempting to send them a copy of
Pandemic last year, which was sold out everywhere. Go figure. Wingspan
looked interesting, and my mother really likes birds, so I sent them a
copy from CSI. Apparently they put two attempts in, but were stymied.
This third attempt, my first exposure to the game, seemed to go pretty
well, although we only played the first round.</p>

<p><strong>Ticket to Ride</strong> I bought for them the last time they were in the Bay
Area. We took a day trip out to Vallejo to the outlet malls for some
clothes shopping, and stopped into a Barnes and Noble (if I recall
correctly). I saw the game on the shelf and picked it up for them.
Apparently they play quite a bit of it.</p>

<p><strong>Jump Drive</strong></p>

<p>This was initially purchased as part of the story recounted below.
I got a single play with Jon to show how the rules work. We decided it's
probably a bit beyond my nephew's reach at this moment, he'll need a
couple more years.</p>

<p><strong>Settlers of Catan</strong></p>

<p>This is one I actually purchased as a "bait" game at work, but nobody
bit. I took the game in and left it publically displayed to see if
anyone would rise to it and organize a game night. Never happened. At
one point one of the temp workers was using it as a monitor stand. This
particular temp was an emaciated women who was quite literally an
envelope stuffer. Pretty sure any kind of board game game activity would
be pretty far outside her interests. I can't imagine using a game box
for a monitor stand. Anyways I brought it home then took it to the folks
house. Surprisingly, mom was all over it on my last night there. Which
is pretty cool. Anyways, I hadn't played it in 10 years, so we stumbled
through the new player set up and mom won, also very cool.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
