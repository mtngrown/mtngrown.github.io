LotR 192 - The Lonely Mountain (6)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 14 2021</time>
<p>Back to <em>The Lonely Mountain</em>, this time with Version 3.4 of <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/87270">Khazad-dum
and the Deeds of Dwarves</a>.
Hopefully this time I'll get a clean win!</p>

<p>Before I got started on this play, I did a bit of tweaking on the deck
to putting Forest Snare in the sideboard in favor of Daeron's Runes. I
also tweaked a few allies. Core Lore allies still rock!</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Narvi's Belt</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>Narvi's Belt</li>
  <li>Bifur</li>
  <li>Second Breakfast</li>
  <li>Fili</li>
</ol>

<p>This isn't the greatest starting hand ever, but it does have Narvi's
Belt and Fili, so it's not bad, let's keep it.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Bifur.</li>
  <li>Planning: Spend pipe to find Bilbo's Magic Ring, then
exhaust that to find Sting, Threat 32.</li>
  <li>Quest: skip.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>It may not be efficient to put Magic Ring and Sting on Bilbo right
away. It wouldn't have been in several previous games.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Dwalin.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Fili to get Kili.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, draw Weighed Down, which is awesome, as that reduces
Will by 1, meaning this is an unsuccessful quest, but Threat only goes
up 1 to 34.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Henamarth Riversong and Erebor Hammersmith.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Henamarth, Erebor Hammersmith, Narvi's Belt on
Thorin. Exhaust Narvi's Belt to play Dwalin. Exhaust Henamarth
to scry Secret Entrance.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, draw Secret Entrance for Threat 36.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Untroubled by Darkness and Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Bifur and draw Erebor Hammersmith and Dwalin. Scry
Dragon Spell.</li>
  <li>Quest: Fili, Kili, Erebor Hammersmith,
draw Dragon-Spell which goes on Bilbo. Threat 38.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<p>Almost time to get a move on, would like to get a second attachment to
handle Burgle on attachments.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Erebor Hammersmith and Daeron's Runes.</li>
  <li>Planning: Daeron's Runes to draw Cram and Ancestral Knowledge,
discard Second Breakfast. Play Miner of the Iron Hills to remove
Dragon-Spell. Hang on to Cram for now. Scry Dragon-Spell.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Thorin, draw Dragon-Spell, attach to Bilbo, net +2
Progress and make a Burgle attempt: Type and cost match for Durin's
Song, discard Ancestral Knowledge and advance to Stage 3. Gain
Thror's Hunting Bow, attach to Thorin. Scry Dark Bats.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Smaug</li>
  <li>Combat: Dwalin defends, shadow Dark Bats which is attached to Dwalin
then goes away, good riddance. Dwalin is dead. Bifur, Fili, Kili,
Erebor Hammersmith and Miner of the Iron Hills puts 3 hits on Smaug.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Fili, Narvi's Belt.</li>
  <li>Planning: Cram on Thorin. Gandalf using pipe
from Bilbo, Threat 35. Play Erebor Hammersmith. Scry Croaking Crows
which is a surge, I need to get at least 4 more Will to ensure
quest success.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Thorin, Bilbo, Bifur, Erebor Hammersmith for 13 Will,
draw Croaking Crows, surge Desolation of Smaug for net -3, Threat 38.</li>
  <li>Travel: Desolation of Smaug.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Croaking Crows.</li>
  <li>Combat: Kili defends against Smaug, shadow Croaking Crows for no
effect, Kili is dead. Dain takes Croaking Corws undefended, shadow
Belching Fire for no effect, 1 hit on Dain. Discard Cram to ready
Thorin, attack with Thorin, Fili, Gandalf, Erebor Hammersmith, Miner of
the Iron Hills for 14, net +6 damage on Smaug.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>

  <li>Planning: Play King Under the Mountain on Dain, draw Cram and Dwarven
Tomb, discard Dwarven Tomb. Need Cram right now. Play Cram on Thorin.
Scry Desolation of Smaug.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Thorin, Bilbo, Bifur, Erebor Hammersmith x 2, draw
Desolation of Smaug for net 0, play Untroubled by Darkness for net +5
Progress to clear Desolation of Smaug with 2 Progress on quest. Need 10
more progress to get Smaug out of play.</li>
  <li>Travel: Desolation of Smaug.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Smaug.</li>
  <li>Combat: Fili defends, shadow Secret Entrance for no effect, Fili is
dead.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: minor asterisk here as I forgot to do a Burgle on A Bare Patch
after questing successfully.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Unexpected Courage and Dwarven Tomb.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Dwalin, Unexpected Courage on Ori, Dwarven Tomb
to get Daeron's Runes back and draw Gandalf, Durin's Song, discard
Narvi's Belt. Scry Dark Bats. King Under the Mountain draw Miner of the
Iron Hills and Henamarth Riversong, discard Henamarth. Play Fili and
Kili, and Gandalf. Threat 37. Play Ancestral Knowledge and exhaust
Miner of the Iron Hills to put 2 Progress on Desolation of Smaug.</li>
  <li>Quest: Ori, Thorin, Bilbo, Bifur, Erebor Hammersmith x2, Kili,
Fili, Dwalin, Gandalf for 25 will, draw Dark Bats for 13 Threat,
clear Desolation of Smaug, put 11 Progress on quest. Play Durin's Song

net no effect with Durin's Song. Dain kills Dark Bats.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 43.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<p>This round is superfluous, but I'm going to play it out anyway.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Longbeard Orc Slayer, Untroubled by Darkness.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Great Hall. King Under the Mountain draws Daeron's
Runes and Miner of the Iron Hills, discard Miner. Daeron's Runes draws
Erebor Record Keeper and Erebor Record Keeper, discard Narvi's Belt from
hand.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not going to play this out, I'd be questing for ~28, it's a clear win
as I only need 14 to clear Stage 3.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Two notes:</p>

<h2 id="aar-1">AAR</h2>

<p>Two notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I did forget to do the Burgle attempt on "A Bare Patch," which I'm
not going to sweat, as I really don't believe it would have changed
the outcome in any meaningful way.</li>
  <li>The Lonely Mountain location allows spending Pipe resources to tinker
with the Burgle outcome, something I've overlooked in every play. When I
play this again, I should deliberately use that mechanism.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>
