LotR 193 - The Battle of Five Armies (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 20 2021</time>
<p>Totally new deck built from scratch, what I'm calling <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/22484/freepeoplesarmy-1.0">Free People's
Army</a>.</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beorn soaks up the early damage. Try not to completely kill him
before at least mid-game. He's not really necessary once you have
a good tableau.</li>
  <li>Sting and Ring on Bilbo of course.</li>
  <li>Thalin gets Horn of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Dunhere gets Orcrist and Blade of Gondolin if possible.</li>
  <li>Unexpected Courage on Bilbo in the late game when you can afford
to use him as a defender.</li>
</ul>

<p>I built this deck by the seat of my pants, very happy it beat <em>The
Battle of Five Armies</em> on it's first go.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Winged Guardian</li>
  <li>Spear of the Citadel</li>
  <li>Blade of Gondolin</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Vassal of the Windlord</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
</ol>

<p>Starting Threat: 29.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Planning: Spend Pipe to find Sting, play on Bilbo. Play
Winged Guardian.</li>
  <li>Quest: Bilbo, Thalin, Winged Guardian on 4B, draw Northern Slopes,
net +2 on 4B.</li>
  <li>Travel: Northern Slopes.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Engage Gundabad Climber and Gunbad Warg Rider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Beorn defends Climber, shadow Hidden Path for no effect,
defends Wolf Rider, shadow Vangaurd of Bolg for no effect. Beorn
kills Climber, Dunhere kills Wolf Rider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>2B Stand and Fight random discard.</li>
  <li>3B Gundabad Climber reenters from discard.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: Bilbo spends to find Orcrist, attach to Dunhere.
Play Gondorian Spearman, sad, but necessary I think.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Bilbo, Winged Guardian, Gondorian Spearman for 9,
draw Hidden Paths for net +4 which clears Northern Slopes.</li>
  <li>Travel: Cannot travel, no pipes.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Gundabod Climber.</li>
  <li>Combat: Beorn defends, shadow Bodyguard of Bolg for no effect,
Dunhere kills, gains a resource.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>2B Blade of Gondolin dscarded, that hurts.</li>
  <li>3B Gundabad Climber reenters from discard.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Vassal of the Windlord and Gandalf, Threat 26.</li>
  <li>Quest: 3B Thalin, Bilbo, Vassal of the Windlord, Gondorian Spearman,
Gandalf for 12, draw Weighed Down which nets 7 for net +2 Progress
on 3B. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Gundbad Climber.</li>
  <li>Combat: Duhere defend, shadow Bodyguard of Bolg for no effect, 2 hits
on Dunhere and Beorn kills it.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 27.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now I have a problem, as I don't have a lot of will, and I need to get
some Progress on 2B so I don't run out of cards.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2B discard Spear of the Citadel.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Veteran Axehand.</li>
  <li>Quest: 3B again, with Thalin, Bilbo, Gondorian Spearman, Vassal
of the Windlord, and Veteran Axehand for 10, draw Ravenous Warg for
net +3 on 3B.</li>
  <li>Travel: Hidden Paths.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ravenous Ward.</li>
  <li>Combat: Beorn defends shadow Bodygaurd of Bolg
for no effect, 2 more hits on Beorn. He can't do any more defending!
Dunhere kills and gets a resource.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>2B discard Feint.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thalin has been a dud so far, which might be a good thing.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Hail of Stones.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Dunhere, Thalin, Bilbo for 4, draw Ruins of Dale.
We get 1 progress on 2B.</li>
  <li>Travel: none, need 3 Pipe to travel, which sucks. I need to get
Magic Ring on Bilbo first thing, and eat the threat increase at the
beginning of the game.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am not losing cards any longer, but Ruins of Dale
removed 2 Progress from 3B.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Planning: Pipe to find Magic Ring, put on Bilbo. Play
Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Quest: 3B, Thalin, Bilbo, Vassal of the Windlord, Veteran Axehand
for 9, draw Bodyguard of Bolg, surge Northern Slopes. Net +1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Ruins of Dale. The forced effect is still in play.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Hail of Stones to take out Bodyguard of Bolg.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remove 2 Progress from 3B.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Favor of the Lady.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Favor of the Lady on Bilbo.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Bilbo, Vassal, Veteran Axehand, Gondorian Spearman
for 11, draw Ravenous Warg, which is bad as it's going to kill Beorn.
I don't see any way around this one. This is where I needed to use Hail
of Stones, or if I had a quick strike that would work too. Ruins of Dale
to Victory display, +3 on 3B. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Travel: Northern Slopes.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ravenous Wargs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Beorn require to defend, shadow Gundabad Climber for no
effect, Beorn succumbs to the Ravenous Warg. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>I might still be able to pull this off depending on what Stage 5B looks
like. I haven't seen it yet.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Unexpected Courage on Bilbo.</li>
  <li>Quest: 4B, Thalin, Bilbo, Winged Guardian, Gondorian Spearman,
Veteran Axehand for 10, draw Hatred Rekindled which surges for Gundabad
Climber, surges Gundbad Wolf Rider. Northern Slopes cleared, net +4
Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Gundabad Wolf Rider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Bilbo defends, draw Vanguard of Bolg to do another damage
to Bodyguard, shadow Vangaurd of Bolg which will have no effect. Bilbo
takes 1 hit. Gondorian Spearman destroys Wolf Rider. Dunhere destroys
Gundabad Climber in the staging area.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: 2B, Thalin, Dunhere, Bilbo for 5, draw Misty Mountain Eagle!
This is almost like like having a hero, super good card. Net +4 on 2B.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 12, draw Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Dunhere, Bilbo, Misty Mountain Eagle for 8, draw
Gundabad Climber, Gundabad Archer to deal 2 hits to Thalin. Net +4
and Stage 2B is ready.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Gundabad Climber. Leave the Archer in staging for now,
he's getting hammered next round.</li>
  <li>Combat: Bilbo defends, Sting draws Hidden Path which eliminates
Gundabad Climber.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 15, draw Horn of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Horn of Gondor on Thalin. If I can pull Landroval,
I'll get Beorn back.</li>
  <li>Quest: 3B: Thalin, Bilbo, Vassal of the Windlord, Veteran Axehand, Eagle
of the Misty Mountain for 13, draw Heedless of Order which is surge
Ravenhill, bummer. Choosing 4B, we have 8 for net +3 Progress on 4B
which clears it.</li>
  <li>Travel: Spend 1 Pipe for Ravenhill.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dunhere takes out the archer in the staging area.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-12">Round 12</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 17, draw Feint.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: 3B: Thalin, Bilbo, Vassal of the Windlord, Veteran Axehand,
Eagle of the Misty Mountain for 13, draw Fighting Among Friends. This
card is stupid, I'm naming Lore and finishing Stages 2B, 3B, and 4B.
Move to Stage 5B. I think I have this, I'll just need to be really
careful on the next quest stage. Actually, I don't think I need to quest
at all, I don't need to make progress, just need to kill everything
before the Threat runs out. I'll still quest with Thalin just in case.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Bolg, Bodyguard of Bolg.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gondorian Spearman defends Bolg, shadow Gundabad Wolf Rider
for no effect, Gondorian Spearman killed, Thalin gets a resource (Horn
of Gondor). Play Feint on Bodyguard, then attack with Dunhere, Bilbo,
Gondorian Spearman to kill Bodyguard.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<p>This could be the last round coming up.</p>

<h4 id="round-13">Round 13</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 20, draw Quick Strike, might be useful.</li>
  <li>Planning: Stand and Fight to pull Gondorian Spearman
back from discard.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, draw Gundabad Archer and Hatred Rekindled.
Archer damage on Gondorian Spearman. Threat 38.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Bolg is engaged, Archer is Threat 40, don't care about
him.</li>
  <li>Combat: Cannot play Feint on Bolg, we'll have Bilbo exhaust with
Magic Ring to defend. Sting deals no damage with Heedless of Order,
shadow Goblins are Upon You! Bilbo raises Threat to 41 for no damage.
Ready Bilbo, add Eagle of the Misty Mountain, Vassal of the Windlord,
Veteran Axehand and Dunhere for 14, which kills Bolg for the win.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This was a long game, many rounds, slow progress, but I believe it
was a solid win. If there are any asterisks, it's with respect to the
particular Treasure cards I included. But I don't really care as the
saga mechanics for the Hobbit are ridiculously hard, and what I used
is thematic.</p>

<p>For 3B I should be using Bearn to quest and have chumps defend. At
least once I have a board state together. Might have been able to knock
a turn or two off the play.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
