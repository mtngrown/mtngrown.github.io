<p>Back in the groove with my usual collaborator. It's been a few weeks as
first he was sick, then I was traveling, then I caught a cold. So it was
nice to get back after it.</p>

<p>We did a bit of deck adjustment to get Sneak Attack into his deck. He
hadn't played it before.</p>

<h2 id="game-194-into-ithilien-1">Game 194. Into Ithilien 1.</h2>

<p>This was an interesting in part because Gandalf got sneak attacked in on
both rounds 1 and 2, which helped move the game along pretty fast. We
ended up getting killed on stage 4, just didn't have enough chumps or
hit points to manage the number of enemies which came out. It felt like
we came close though.</p>

<h2 id="game-195-into-ithilien-2">Game 195. Into Ithilien 2.</h2>

<p>This was a more normal game than the first, with no sneak attack Gandalf
combos. We didn't clear the Ithilien Road location on the first round
though, which meant handling everything in staging. I lost Dunhere. On
the second round the boss Mumlak came out, we called the game as we
would have lost all the heroes anyway.</p>

<p>This is a doable quest, we just have not quite got it dialed in.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
