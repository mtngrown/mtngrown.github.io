LotR 196 - The Battle of Lake Town (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Oct  2 2021</time>
<p>First play of <em>The Battle of Lake Town</em>. I'm using the
<a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/300372">Free People's Army</a>
deck which punked <em>The Battle of Five Armies</em>. I don't think it's
going to do very well here, but it's the deck I have in hand, so let's
see what we get.</p>

<p>Initial Hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Horn of Gondor</li>
  <li>Gondorian Spearman</li>
  <li>Vassal of the Windlord</li>
  <li>Hail of Stones</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Blade of Gondolin</li>
</ol>

<p>Encounter: Scorching Blast for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Westfold Horse Breeder.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Westfold Horse Breeder, Blade of Gondolin, Horn
of Gondor on Dunhere.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Westfold, draw Catching Fire, which is surge in
this case, Catching Fire again, surge North Pier. Smaug targets the
staging area, brings 7 Threat. Dang. Threat 36.</li>
  <li>Travel: North Pier.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, this is going to be bona fide pretty brutal. It's either fast
threating out, or losing a character per turn, which means getting
more than 1 character per turn on average. Not quite sure where to
go with this right now. Since I'll get a new version of Smaug each
round, might as well play this out to the bitter end to see what
happens.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Gondorian Spearman.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin, Westfold, Smaug targets player, draw Smaug the Mighty,
Merchant's District for Threat 39. Smaug attacks Gondorian Spearman,
shadow FIsherman's Dock, which goes into Staging area. Dang.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Smaug</li>
  <li>Combat: Beorn defends, shadow Merchant's District for 1 hit on
Lake Town.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Landroval.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Thalin and Westfold, draw Smaug the Terrible into the staging
area for +12 Threat and game over.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>That didn't take long. Wasn't all that much fun either. Since I didn't
really get how Smaug worked, I watched the first part of a podcast which
sort of spoiled the quest with respect to how to beat it.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
