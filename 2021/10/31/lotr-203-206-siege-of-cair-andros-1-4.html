LotR 203-206 - The Siege of Cair Andros (1-4)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Oct 31 2021</time>
<p>My usual collaborator and I take on <em>The Siege of Cair Andros</em>. This
quest is rated pretty difficult by the community, right up there with
<em>Escape from Dol Guldur</em> for two-player games. We're going into it
blind, and have no idea whether our decks will manage it or not.</p>

<h2 id="game-203">Game 203</h2>

<p>We went 3 rounds on this one, with the Mumak coming out and stomping us.
The initial quest stage is Siege questing, and we just didn't have
enough to get through Stage 1 in the first couple of rounds. Looks like
aggro questing is the way to go here. Anyways, we were swarmed and
we scooped.</p>

<h2 id="game-204">Game 204</h2>

<p>One of the treacheries put all the <em>Battleground</em> locations back in the
deck, which meant we'd have to quest through all the stages unless we
got really lucky. Beregond eliminated in first or second round, we
scooped.</p>

<h2 id="game-205">Game 205</h2>

<p>We did better on this game, cleared <em>The Banks</em> location to remove Stage
2 automatically. Still had to scoop.</p>

<h2 id="game-206">Game 206</h2>

<p>This game almost went the distance. We even made to Stage 5, and if we
had not been at 49 threat, we might have been able to pull off the win.
We ended up doing some deck tuning after the previous game, with both of
us adding in various eagles and Defender of Ramma, with the notion that
we both mulligan for having at least one Defender of Ramma or Winged
Guardian, both of which defend for 4 and are excellent for siege
questing. So good in fact that we cleared Stage 1 on the first round,
then found that Stage 2 requires Willpower questing, of which we had
very little. This caused our threat to more or less +10, which is a lot
in any game, but with the amount Doomed cards, really hurts in this
quest. We were able to remove Stage 2 via clearing <em>The Banks</em> with
Legolas, but not before the threat damage was inflicted.</p>

<p>Once having Stage 2 removed, even with our threat in the mid-to-high
40s, we still blasted through getting to Stage 5 with 49 threat. So
close! We're now confident we can beat this quest, even though it may
take a few more tries.</p>

<p>Not bad for a short afternoon.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
