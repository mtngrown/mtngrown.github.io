<p>I just finished reading all of the reviews for Absolutely Aces,
including my own. It's clear that this little card game really
isn't for everyone. It really isn't. In fact, it's probably not
for very many people at all.</p>

<p>But it's for me.</p>

<p>I've logged over 100 plays now, nearly all of the them solo,
playing one side as Schlock, the other side as Kaff. I haven't
done any stats yet, so I can't say if there is a first player
advantage. It doesn't feel like it.</p>

<p>Luck is a big factor in the game. But it's not the only factor,
a player has to score 15 points to win, and that's easier said
than done. Since it's impossible to win on a single round, the
game must proceed over multiple rounds, and this distributes
the luck between players.</p>

<p>Playing against myself, I regularly go 6 rounds before one side
scores 15. Fortunately, rounds go very quickly, with experience
a minute or few minutes each.</p>

<p>Despite what seems to be pure luck of the card draw, there are usually
one or more decisions available in each hand. Do you block with, say,
the Break? Or use the Ace, or maybe the pair of Rolls? Each of these
decisions has different consequences, all of which lurk right at the
edge of my cognitive ability. I can usually see 2 turns ahead, and
that's usually not quite enough. But sometimes it is! And it's cool!</p>

<p>Absolutely Aces plays fast, like Zombie Dice fast.</p>

<p>After 100 plays, I'm still finding nuance, and looking forward to the
next 100 plays.</p>

<p>I do recommend the game to anyone willing to put in a few plays
to learn the blocking combinations, and who has an equally motivated
and competitive opponent, and who is willing to approach the game as
it is, not as they want it to be. Per Hollandspeile's philosophy,
I'd recommend most others avoid it.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
