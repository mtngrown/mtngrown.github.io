2022 Mastery Challenge
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 31 2021</time>
<p>As is lately traditional on New Year's Eve, I take stock of the
past year of games, and think about the upcoming year. I no
longer make definite plans, I have a day job for that. What is
fun is seeing how various counts and stats evolve over the
year. That said, High Frontier will likely get the most attention
through 2022.</p>

<p><strong>2022-01-16</strong>: Current average plays for count of owned games: <code>1076 / 120 = 8.75</code></p>

<p>Here are the challenges from previous years:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/2020/12/31/2021-mastery-challenge.html">2021 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2019/12/31/2020-mastery-challenge.html">2020 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2018/12/31/2019-mastery-challenge.html">2019 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017/12/31/2018-mastery-challenge.html">2018 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2016/12/31/2017-mastery-challenge.html">2017 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2015/12/31/2016-challenge.html">2016 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It's becoming quite a list! One day, probably after I retire, I hope
to return to serious mastery for one or more of these games.</p>

<h3 id="h-index">H-index</h3>

<p>I don't take H-index very seriously. It's been stalled out around 13-14
for years. I could pretty easily get it to 15 or 16, but it's going to
get pretty hard to advance it after that. So many of the games I enjoy
playing are long, time consuming affairs, which biases the H-index down
with respect to the time spent playing. It's still fun to watch it
evolve.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>209/208</code> <strong>Lord of the Rings LCG</strong> will almost surely remain my top
played game in 2022. It's just too far ahead of any others, and I have a
regular collaborator to ensure it's getting on the table on a regular
cadence. I also play it solo which ups the count.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>107/107</code> <strong>Absolutely Aces</strong> will definitely see a few plays. It's
too fast and easy not to play. That said, I didn't play it as much in
2021 as I had thought I would.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>64/64</code> <strong>Hive</strong> not anticipating serious play this year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>44/44</code> <strong>Ogre</strong> probably won't see any play this unless they
call of the plague. This game is so much more fun with a group of
people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>38/37</code> <strong>High Frontier 4 All</strong> I anticipate getting significant
number of plays in during 2022. There is no other game even remotely
like it, and I don't feel like I've yet explored much of the game
space. Prediction: at least a dozen plays, including a few super
long futures games (which is where the real fun is).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>33/32</code> <strong>Zombie Dice</strong> as opportunity arises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>PanzerBlitz</strong> might get hauled out for a solo spin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>26/26</code> <strong>Star Realms</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>21/21</code> <strong>Race for the Galaxy</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20/20</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong> I'd like to play the campaign
scenarios, which take more time and table space than I can
easily muster as far as I can see into 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>19/19</code> <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> not scheduling any plays in 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>17/17</code> <strong>6 Nimmt!</strong> might take this to Ft Wayne to play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Battle for Moscow</strong> can be played on line against an AI.
Very convenient!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>15/15</code> <strong>Cathedral</strong> will get no plays as I don't own it, and have
no plans to purchase it as the game is very tightly controlled by the
rights owner, and it's solved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>14/14</code> <strong>Ogre: Objective 218</strong> probably get a solo play in at
some point. This is a good one for doing chores between turns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>14/14</code> <a href="http://consim.local:4568/tags/starforce.html">StarForce</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/13</code> <strong>Vietnam Solitaire</strong> will hit the table if I get serious
about bumping H-index to 16. Will probably get a play in for 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Hapsburg Eclipse</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Objective Kiev</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Pandemic</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Soviet Dawn</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Target Leningrad</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>Leaving Earth</strong> I'd like to get at least one good play
in, with the Stations expansion. I've never played Stations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Flash Point</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Jump Drive</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>OCS</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong> maybe for small scenarios opening up the
Sickle Cut.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>6/6</code> <strong>Android:Netrunner</strong> probably ought to drop off this list.
My previous opponent for the game has evolved into a collaborator for
Lord of the Rings card game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>3/3</code> <strong>High Frontier 3rd Edition</strong> might get a play or two, just
for fun, to see how the rules differ from the 4th edition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>1/1</code> <strong>Other COIN</strong> probably won't get played, and might even
drop off the list. I don't enjoy these games solo, and don't have
a regular opponent for them. Probably ought to sell them as well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wargame-specific-h-index">Wargame-specific H-index</h3>

<p>My wargame-specific H-index started 2019 at 10. Wargames are so much
more time consuming that this index will increase much, much more slowly
than the overall H-index. I do not expect much progress on this list
in 2020.</p>

  <li><code>44</code> Ogre</li>
  <li><code>27</code> PanzerBlitz</li>
  <li><code>20</code> Silver Bayonet</li>
  <li><code>19</code> Fire in the Lake</li>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
