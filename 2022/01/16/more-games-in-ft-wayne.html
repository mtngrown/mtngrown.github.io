<p>My parents have started playing a fair number of board games. My
mother in particular has always enjoyed them. We used to play
quite a bit back when I was a child.</p>

<p><strong>Friday 2022-01-14</strong> Got a few games in with Jon before picking up
pizza. These are all short fast games, the idea is to figure out what he
likes which would also be popular with Stuart's kids. I left Quoridor
and 6 Nimmt! there, as I'm not playing either one of them at the moment,
and they're easy enough to replace if I decide I want them back.</p>

<h2 id="quoridor">Quoridor</h2>

<p>I've had this game for several years, but it's not really caught
my attention. For abstracts, I prefer Hive. Hive is really absorbing
so I don't play it much either, but I'd like to play more. Since I'm
not really an abstracts player in general, I figured if he liked
Quoridor, I'd just leave it here.</p>

<p>Upshot: the game is staying in Ft. Wayne. While I won our initial
game, he likes it enough to want to play it with the grandson, which
is the point. I won this game.</p>

<h2 id="nimmt">6 Nimmt!</h2>

<p>Since Quoridor is a 2 player game, I followed it up with 6 Nimmt!
as the family plays a fair number of multiplayer games. After a
bit of confusion until I remembered (reread) the rules, we played
a round to show him how the game works. It was enough of a hit to
leave in Ft. Wayne. If I need another copy I'll just buy one.
Also, I won the round.</p>

<h2 id="tantrix">Tantrix</h2>

<p>Tantrix is coming back home with me, but I did want to get his
opinion on it. We played through the most of a game, and he was
able to get a 19 tile loop for 38 points, which is really good.
I managed to get only 13 points this game.</p>

<p>All in all a pretty good time.</p>

<h2 id="another-wingspan-play">Another Wingspan play</h2>

<p>Played this with the folks. We started pretty late in the evening,
and after the first round and a bit, I suggested we just play the
mechanics of the game more than worrying about scoring overmuch.
I think we have the mechanics more or less figured out now. Scoring
is a whole different beast, and is where the complexity of the
game really emerges. I may try to set it up solitaire to figure out
scoring.</p>

<h2 id="raccoon-tycoon-saturday-jan-15-2022">Raccoon Tycoon (Saturday Jan 15 2022)</h2>

<p>This is a family favorite in Ft Wayne, I finally got around to playing
it with my mom. I went over the rules methodically and we "relearned"
the game as the house rules bear only some slight resemblance to
the actual rules of the game. The game is pretty well designed albeit
not overly complex. There is enough throttling through the market
mechanism to manage runaway leader situations.</p>

<h2 id="carcasonne-sunday-jan-16-2022">Carcasonne (Sunday, Jan 16 2022)</h2>

<p>I picked this up for the fam, and the mom cracked it open. I managed to win it,
not quite sure how that happened other than getting lucky on tile draw. This
is a good four player game, and I'm glad everyone liked it. It's also
fun for me to play a four player game once in a while, as most of my
gaming is either solitaire, or with one other person.</p>

<h2 id="wingspan-solo-monday-jan-17-2022">Wingspan solo (Monday, Jan 17 2022)</h2>

<p>Solo play going through the rules very carefully but not using the
automa bot. This was super helpful for getting the rules really figured
out. Mom worked through the rules with me, we went through ot stepwise
where she read the particular rules in question, and I moved the parts
on my board. This is a good way to learn games.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
