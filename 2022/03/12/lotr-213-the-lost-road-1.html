LotR 213 - The Lost Road (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 12 2022</time>
<p>I had intended on digging into The Battle of Laketown today,
but I found that I had misplaced my Elrond/Vilya deck. I wasn't
necessarily going to use it for the quest, but it bothered me
a lot, and I had to stop everything else I was doing to find it.
As it turned out, I had more or less torn down that deck, and
stashed Elrond, Vilya, and a few other cards in with my duplicates
and alt-art cards. By the time I figured all this out, I had
decided to start the Ninjadorg scenarios instead.</p>

<p>Starting with <em>The Lost Road</em>, the first of a sequence of 6 quests,
requires building a single hero, single sphere deck, preferably
limited to Core cards, which I've done with the deck I built
for the first scenario: <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/26344/ninjadorg-thelostroad-1.0">Ninkadorg - The Lost
Road</a>.</p>

<p>After mulligan, initial hand from a small, Leadership
deck:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>Son of Arnor</li>
  <li>Steward of Gondor</li>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
</ol>

<p>Not too bad, would like to have had Celebrian's Stone as
well, but with Steward I'll be able to play it quickly.</p>

<p>With a single hero, starting threat is 12, so I can
let some things build in the staging area for a round or two.</p>

<p>There is no initial staging set up, which is good.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 1, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Dol Guldur Orcs for no effect,
there is no one committed to the quest. Threat 14.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn will defend this one,
shadow The Necromancer's Reach for no effect. Nice to get rid of
one of those early in the game. No damage on Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 15.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 2, draw For Gondor!</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Quest: none, draw Enchanted Stream, Threat 17.</li>
  <li>Travel: none, can't draw with Enchanted Stream active.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends again, shadow Dol Guldur Beastmaster
for no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 18.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Snowborn Scout x2 clearing Enchanted Stream.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, pays 1 to ready, draw Necromancer's Pass
Threat 19.</li>
  <li>Travel: going to risk losing good cards, and travel to
Necromancer's Pass: discard For Gondor! and Faramir. No
big deal, semi-lucky</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends, shadow Forest Spider,
and I have to discard Steward of Gondor. That stings!
Aragorn kills Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 20.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Steward of Gondor, excellent.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Faramir. Expensive, but hopefully
I can get a couple more rounds from Steward and build
up my cash again.</li>
  <li>Quest: Faramir, draw Forest Gate net 0 on Threat.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 21.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn, Faramir for 4, draw Chieftain Ufthak.
I'm going to Sneak Attack Gandalf in right here committed
to the quest, and drawing 3 card: Valiant Sacrifice, Sneak
Attack, and Steward of Gondor. This clears Necromancer's
Pass.</li>
  <li>Travel: Forest Gate, which is probably not the greatest
move, but we'll see how it plays out.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 22.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Ever Vigilant.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Faramir, Aragorn, and I have forgotten that I only
stage on odd turns, so I'm not going to draw any cards this
time, and quest with Aragorn, Faramir to clear Forest Gate
and draw Gandalf and Guard of the Citadel. Where are the Celebrian
Stones!</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 23.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Aragorn &amp; pay to ready, Faramir, draw Dol Guldur
Beastmaster. Sneak Attack Gandalf committed to the quest
to put 4 damage on Dol Guldur Beastmaster and clear Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Guldur Beastmaster.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends,
shadow The Necromancer's Reach, excellent! Play Valiant Sacrifice
to draw Valiant Sacrifice and Ever Vigilant. Legolas swings
for 3, killing the beastmaster, and clearing Stage 2.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 24.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Ever Vigilant. This is going to win the
game right here. (Turns out I don't need it.)</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Gandalf, 4 hits on Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Quest: Faramir, Gandalf, Aragorn for 8, draw Forest Gate,
and that clears Stage 3 for a win.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Once in a while it feels nice to absolutely pummel a scenario.
I could have beaten this one faster, too, had I not forgotten
that staging only occurs on odd rounds. I only remembered to
<em>not</em> staging on Round 6. It might be worth playing this again
to see how fast I can beat it playing it correctly.</p>

<p>Then again, the Encounter deck definitely softballed me. Slow
pitch too. Super easy draw given there are a some moderately
nasty cards given restriction to core cards.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
