LotR 214 - The Old Forest (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 13 2022</time>
<p>Quest 2 in Ninjadorg's series of 6. Unlike Quest 1, this quest
does not require single hero, single sphere deck, so I'm going to
have to build another deck for it. I'm going for a dual sphere with
the obvious choice of Eowyn and Theodred to round it out. This is
just a power combo, even if the threat start a bit high at 29.
The longer I play this game the more impressed I am with the
power in some of the core set cards.</p>

<p>Initial hand after mulligan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Son of Arnor</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke</li>
  <li>Guard of the Citadel</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Valiant Sacrifice.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest:  Eowyn, Aragorn, Theodred for 7, draw Hummhorns.
Net 4 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: None.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wolf Rider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn takes it undefended, shadow Mountains of Mirkwood
for no effect, 2 hits on Aragorn. Aragorn kills Wolf Rider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw The Brown Lands, Threat 31.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Brown Lands, which clears.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Celebrian's Stone.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Eowyn, draw Black Forest Bats and remove
Theodred from the quest, which is fine, he adds the resource
<em>when</em> he commits, so that's done. Net 2 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Black Forest Bats.</li>
  <li>Combat: Guard of the Citadel defends Black Forest Bats, shadow
Enchanted Stream for no effect. 1 hit on Guard, Aragorn kills
the bats.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Son of Arnor, Steward of Gondor, and Celebrian's Stone.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw The East Bight. Stage 1 is cleared.
Chieftain Ufthak goes into staging area.</li>
  <li>Travel: The East Bight.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Engage Ufthak optionally.</li>
  <li>Combat: Guard of the Citadel defends, shadow Marsh Adder for
no effect. Guard of the Citadel is killed, play Valiant Sacrifice
draw Unexpected Courage and Hasty Stroke. Aragorn, Guard of the Citadel,
Son of Arnor attack for 3 hits on Ufthak.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Unexpected Courage on Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Dol Guldur Orcs, 2 hits on Eowyn, will
save Test of Will for worse cards. Net 1 Progress on East Bight.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Play Stand and Fight to bring in Guard of the Citadel,
defends against Ufthak, shadow Caught in a Web for no effect.
Guard of the Citadel defends Dol Guldur Orcs, shadow King Spider
which requires exhausting a characters under my control. I'm
going to cancel this with Hasty Stroke. Aragorn, Theodred, Son
of Arnor swing for 6 to kill Ufthak. Ready Aragorn with Unexpected
Courage, he kills Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm a bit short on allies here. Probably need to stall to get my board
state in a little bit better shape before tackling the Hill Troll, which
is for sure coming in Stage 3. Hopefully I won't find the <em>other</em> Hill
Troll before than.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Stength of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Aragorn, Theodred for 7, draw Mountains of Mirkwood,
net 4 Progress on The East Bight.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>I forgot to add +1 Will to Aragorn due to Celebrian's Stone.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 15, draw For Gondor!</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Aragorn, Theodred, draw Hill Troll. Dang.
This does clear The East Bight and put 3 Progress on
Stage 2.</li>
  <li>Travel: Can't risk traveling to Mountains of Mirkwood.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Combat: Son of Arnor defends, shadow Dol Guldur
Beastmaster for no effect. Threat 39. Uh oh.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<p>This is likely curtains for this play.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 19(!), draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gandalf to deal 4 hits to Hummerhorns, otherwise
it's game over. Stand and Fight to put Son of Arnor into play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw East Bight Patrol, Threat 41.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: East Bight Patrol.</li>
  <li>Combat: Hill Troll defended by Gandalf, shadow Driven
By Shadow for no effect, 2 hits on Gandalf. Theodred defends
East Bight Patrol, shqdaw Enchanted Stream for no effect, 1 hit
on Theodred. Aragorn takes out East Bight Patrol. Play For Gondor!
to put 4 hits on Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Sneak Attack. Would have liked to have had
this a couple of rounds ago.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Aragorn, draw Wargs for net 3 Progress.
This is looking ugly.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wargs</li>
  <li>Combat: Son of Arnor defends Hill Troll, shadow Necromancer's Pass
for no effect. Threat 46. Aragorn and Theodred put 2 more hits
on Hill Troll. If I draw a Gandalf I can save this game, otherwise,
I'm toast. Aragorn defends Wargs, shadow Forest Gate for no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 47</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm calling it here, there is no chance of me winning this thing
even if I drew a Gandalf. The troll would either kill one of the
heros or I would threat out from excess damage.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This is a pretty cool scenario, I think a bit easier than
Journey Along the Anduin, but has the same sort of risk profile
with all the bad boss enemies in play. This deck or something
pretty close to it can beat it, I'm pretty sure. I may need
to add more Leadership allies.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
