LotR 217 - Forgotten Ruins from Ninjadorg
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Mar 19 2022</time>
<p>Quest 3 in Ninjadorg's 6 quest core cycle. I'm playing it
with the same deck which beat <em>The Old Forest</em>, which I'm
calling <a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/26569/ninjadorg2-theoldforest-1.0">Ninjadorg 2 - The Old
Forest</a>.
I'll probably fork that deck to build for this quest, depending on
how this first play goes. It would be cool to beat the whole cycle
with a single deck, but that's a task to accomplish once I've played
through everything.</p>

<p>Initial hand after mulligan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>Guard of the Citadel</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>Celebrian's Stone</li>
</ol>

<p>Nothing is revealed from the encounter deck on setup.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Stand and Fight.</li>
  <li>Planning: Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Cavern Guardian, Threat 30.
Net 3 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Cavern Guardian.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends, shadow Goblin Sniper for
no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw For Gondor!</li>
  <li>Planning: Unexpected Courage on Aragorn, Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Hill Troll. Dang. Net +3 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Combat: Guard of the Citadel defends Cavern Guardian, shadow
Dungeon Jailer for no effect. Aragorn defends Hill Troll, shadow
The East Bight for no effect, Aragorn takes 4 damage. Sneak Attack
Gandalf put 4 damage on Hill Troll, Aragorn, Gandald, Theodred
swing for net 6 hits to kill hill troll.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: None.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, draw Dol Guldur Orcs, 2 damage to
Theodred, Threat 33.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Eowyn defends Dol Guldur Orcs, shadow Enchanted Stream for
no effect. Aragorn defends Cavern Guardian, shadow Necromancer's Pass
for no effect. Aragorn kills Cavern Guardian.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 10, draw Faramir.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Faramir.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, draw Despair, which is excellent as the
quest only has 3 progress on it now, postponing when Ungoliant's
Spawn comes out.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir defends Dol Guldur Orcs, shadow Hummerhorns! This
would be game end but Eowyn plays Hasty Stroke to cancel it and
Faramir takes no damage. Aragorn kills Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 35.</li>
</ol>

<p>We're in danger land now, as several enemies come out on threat 35.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, draw Enchanted Stream, Threat 36.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Ever Vigilant.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Under the Shadow for +1 Threat,
net +1 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Son of Arnor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Son of Arnor.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Misty Mountain Goblins for net 0 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Misty Mountain Goblins.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir defends, shadow Tower Gate for no effect.
Aragorn and Son of Arnor kill Misty Mountain Goblins.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Snowbourn Scout putting progress on
Enchanted Stream.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Dol Guldur Orcs which deals 2 hits
to Eowyn which kills her.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm calling the game here due to Threat, lack of progress,
and losing Eowyn too early. I do have a pretty decent board
state, but it's a little too late to matter.</p>

<p>This deck may need tuning for card draw and threat reduction.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
