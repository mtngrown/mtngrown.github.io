Vietnam 1965-1975 3 - Operation Starlite (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr  9 2022</time>
<p>This is a solo game to get reacquainted with the rules,
particularly combat resolution, which is non-standard.
While the map and counters are from my Victory Games
edition, I'm using the new GMT rules.</p>

<p>I'v been meaning to get this thing going for a couple of
weeks, but haven't been able to muster the energy to get
started. For today, I'm not going to worry about progress
overmuch, instead will focus on <em>process</em> of (re)learning
the game, starting with the turn sequence. To wit: "Who
moves first?" is the initial problem to solve.</p>

<p>Who goes first:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Support Phase: FWA only.</li>
  <li>Special Ops Phase: FWA, then NLF.</li>
  <li>Strategic Movement: FWA only.</li>
  <li>Operations Phase: NLF chooses who conducts first Operation.</li>
</ol>

<p>For Operation Starlite, for the first turn we can go straight
to Operations Phase.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>

<h3 id="us-forces">US forces</h3>

<ul>
  <li>5118: 3/3/3M, 2/4/3M, 155 mm artillery</li>
  <li>5220: 3/7/1M, 7/1M HQ</li>
  <li>4 replacement points</li>
  <li>4 air points</li>
  <li>1 air mobile point</li>
  <li>1 cruiser</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nlf-forces">NLF forces</h3>

<ul>
  <li>5219 or 5320: 1st Regiment VC, Political Section (this game, choose hex 5219)</li>
  <li>4 VC replacement points</li>
  <li>All VC movement allowances reduced by 2.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<h3 id="support-phase">1. Support Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player indicates available air, airmobile, and riverine support
on his record sheet, placing appropriate markers on the General
Record Track.</p>

<h3 id="special-operations-designation-phase">2. Special Operations Designation Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The US player notes any units on holding or patrol operations.</li>
  <li>The NLF also notes units on holding or patrol operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>US decides to do nothing here.</p>

<h3 id="strategic-movement-phase">3. Strategic Movement Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player may conduct security operations and employ strategic
and naval movement.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<h3 id="operations-phase">4. Operations Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The heart of the Vietnam <em>1965-1975</em> game is the <em>operation</em>.
The three main things to remember about operations are:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The NLF player always determines who performs the next operation,
and may choose to pass in favor of the US player performing an
operation (Section 5, page 9).</li>
  <li>Each unit may perform only one operation per turn (Section 2.2, page 5).</li>
  <li>Operations proceed as a series of <em>rounds</em> until the US declines is
unable to perform further operations. The NLF then decides to either
continue operations or end the Operations Phase (Section 5, page 9).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operations are explained in brief in Section 2.2, page 5,
and described in detail in Section 5, page 9 of the rules.</p>

<h4 id="a-designation-segment">A. Designation Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">As explained in the preface material in Section 5 (page 9), the
NLF always designates who conducts the next operation. The designated
player is the <em>phasing</em> player and commences to:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Choose the type of operation;</li>
  <li>which units participate;</li>
  <li>the <em>target hex</em> of the units (if applicable).</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="operation-1-nlf">Operation 1, NLF</h5>

<p>NLF takes the first operation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search and Destroy.</li>
  <li>Units: Both Polsec and regiment.</li>
  <li>Target hex: 5220, FWA cannot React.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-2-us">Operation 2, US</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search and Destroy</li>
  <li>Units: 3/3</li>
  <li>Target hex: 5020</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-3-us">Operation 3, US</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search &amp; Destroy</li>
  <li>Units:  3/7/1M, 2/4/3M, 7/1M, 2/12 155 Howitzer.</li>
  <li>Target hex: 5019.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="b-support-declaration-segment">B. Support Declaration Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player may:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Assign air support;</li>
  <li>Assign naval support;</li>
  <li>Declare free fire zones.</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.1 (page 9) contains details.</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>None.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-us-1">Operation 2, US</h5>

<p>None.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-us-1">Operation 3, US</h5>

<ol>
  <li>4 Air Points</li>
  <li>6 Cruiser Points.</li>
  <li>No Free Fire (per scenario rules)</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="c-movement-segment">C. Movement Segment</h4>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-1">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>VC movement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Polsec: Hex 5020</li>
  <li>Regiment: 5121</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-2-us-2">Operation 2, US</h5>

<p>3/3 moves to Hex 5020, expends 5 MPs:
- 3 MP for moving 3 hexes though cultivated terrain.
- +1 MP for crossing minor river
- +1 MP for leaving Hex 5019, which is in VC regiment's ZOC.</p>

<p>VC regiment Reaction: move to Hex 5019. This is interesting:
there is a difference in the maps. On the new map, the road
goes to 5118 instead of 5019 as shown on the VG map. Anyways,
this regiment spend 3 of 4 MP on the new map, 2 of 4 MP
on the old map.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-us-2">Operation 3, US</h5>

<ul>
  <li>3/7/1M to 4920.</li>
  <li>2/4/3M to 5120.</li>
  <li>2/12 and 7/1M to 5119.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="d-alert-segment-only-in-us-operations">D. Alert Segment (only in US operations)</h4>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-2">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-us-3">Operation 2, US</h5>

<p>VC Political Section in 5020, roll 3.
Alert movement allowance is 3  + 1 (cultivated terrain) - 2
(scenario restriction). Required is 1 for cultivated terrain + 2
for leaving enemy hex, result is no Alert movement.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-us-3">Operation 3, US</h5>

<p>VC regiment in 5019, roll 4 for alert. Result:
- +4 for die roll
- +1 for cultivated terrain
- -2 for scenario.
- Total MP: 3</p>

<p>Movement cost to 5018:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 for leaving enemy hex</li>
  <li>1 for interdiction</li>
  <li>1 for entering 5018.</li>
  <li>Total required: 4</li>
</ul>

<p>Upshot, no Alert movement.</p>

<h4 id="e-combat-segment">E. Combat Segment</h4>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-3">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>No combat.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-us-4">Operation 2, US</h5>

<p>Attack 5020, reveal Political Section which is removed
from map, 3/3 is Ops Complete.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-us-4">Operation 3, US</h5>

<p>The counter is flipped, revealing a VC regiment:
- Combat: 6
- Support: 2</p>

<p>Attacking units are 3/7/1M and 2/4/3M, with 2/12 and
7/1M in support:
- Combat: 6
- Support:
  - 2/12: 7
  - 7/1M: 8
  - Air: 4
- Total: 19 / 2 = 9.5 (no Free Fire).</p>

<p>15.5 / 8 = 3 to 2, DRM +1.</p>

<p>Roll 2 + 1:</p>

<p>VC: 6 + 9.5 = 15.5, lose 2 Replacement Points.
US: 6 + 2 = 8, lose 1 Replacement Point and 1 Air Point,
no Pursuit modifier.</p>

<h4 id="f-retreat-segment">F. Retreat Segment</h4>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-4">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="operation-2-us-5">Operation 2, US</h4>

<p>None.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-us-5">Operation 3, US</h5>

<p>VC regiment retreats to 5018, which costs:
- 1 to enter 5018,
- 2 for leaving 5019,
- 1 for being under interdiction.</p>

<h4 id="g-pursuit-segment">G. Pursuit Segment</h4>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-5">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>None.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-us-6">Operation 2, US</h5>

<p>None.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-us-6">Operation 3, US</h5>

<p>This is nuanced: Both USMC battalions have Pursuit
capability, and here's how it played out.</p>

<p>2/4/3M is going to stay where it is as it can still
attack, and its unused Pursuit value can be used as
a DRM.</p>

<p>3/7/1M is going to spend the Airmobile point and move to
hx 4919, which cost 2 MPs to land in a ZOC. I believe this
spends 2 of the 3 Pursuit MPs for 3/7/1M.</p>

<p>2/12 and 7/1M stay put and will provide support for next
combat round.</p>

<p>Combat round 2:</p>

<p>VC: 6 ground + 2 support
US: 3 ground + 25 / 2 support -&gt; 12 total b/c support
cannot exceed 3x ground combat value.
Odds: 12 / 8 = 3 / 2.</p>

<p>VC: column value 6 + 12.5 = 18.5.
US: column value 3 + 2 = 5.</p>

<p>Roll 3 + 1 (odds) + 3 (2/4/3M Pursuit) = 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC: column value 6 + 18 = 18, lose 3 Replacement Points
to eliminate the unit.</li>
  <li>US: column value 3 + 2 = 5, lose 1 Replacement Point, and
an Airmobile Point if hot LZ.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it.</p>

<h4 id="h-interdiction-removal-segment">H. Interdiction Removal Segment</h4>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-6">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="i-continuous-operations-combat-segment">I. Continuous Operations Combat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Now return to Segment and and repeat until neither player is able or
willing to conduct an operation.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This took me most of two days to play through, but I do believe
I have a complete understanding of each step. Playing the new
rules, with the new example playthrough, turned out to be both
confusing and helpful. Confusing because the playthroughs are
slightly different, helpful because the differences forced me to
really dig into what's happening.</p>

<p>I recall having a few questions after my previous (first)
experience with this example scenario, which I do not recall
resolving. These questions are sprinkled
<a href="/2015/01/18/operation-starlite-vietnam-1965-1975.html">through that playthrough</a>.</p>

<p>In that playthrough, I did a simple comparison of complexity for
this game with respect to other games. Seven years later it's time
to update that, so here's a new procedural complexity in increasing
order, as I see it.</p>

<p>Ogre &lt; PanzerBlitz &lt; "Dark" series &lt; Simonich '4x &lt; High Frontier &lt; OCS &lt; VN &lt; EFS</p>

<p>Of the games I've played, only East Front Series has more procedural complexity,
and that's debatable. While EFS has a long, complex turn sequence, VN has
multiple different procedures depending what sort of Operation one conducts.
It's like if every Operation in Fire in the Lake required throwing counters for a
full order of battle on the map, and playing it out tactically.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
