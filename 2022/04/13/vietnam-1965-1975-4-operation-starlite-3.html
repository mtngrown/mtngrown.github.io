Vietnam 1965-1975 4 - Operation Starlite (3)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 13 2022</time>

<p>Let's see if third time really is the charm. This game I'm
not going to consult the playthrough. I'm going to work
the rules and the flowcharts. I should be fine. All of the
operations in this scenario are going to be Search &amp; Destroy,
which makes it easier.</p>

<p>I have no idea how long this is going to take to play out.
The previous play occupied most of a weekend, at least mentally.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<h3 id="support-phase">1. Support Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player indicates available air, airmobile, and riverine support
on his record sheet, placing appropriate markers on the General
Record Track.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Naval: 6</li>
  <li>Air: 4</li>
  <li>Airmobile: 1</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="special-operations-designation-phase">2. Special Operations Designation Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The US player notes any units on holding or patrol operations.</li>
  <li>The NLF also notes units on holding or patrol operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>None.</p>

<h3 id="strategic-movement-phase">3. Strategic Movement Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player may conduct security operations and employ strategic
and naval movement.</p>

<p>None.</p>

<h3 id="operations-phase">4. Operations Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The heart of the Vietnam <em>1965-1975</em> game is the <em>operation</em>.
The three main things to remember about operations are:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The NLF player always determines who performs the next operation,
and may choose to pass in favor of the US player performing an
operation (Section 5, page 9).</li>
  <li>Each unit may perform only one operation per turn (Section 2.2, page 5).</li>
  <li>Operations proceed as a series of <strong>rounds</strong> until the US declines is
unable to perform further operations. The NLF then decides to either
continue operations or end the Operations Phase (Section 5, page 9).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operations are explained in brief in Section 2.2, page 5,
and described in detail in Section 5, page 9 of the rules.</p>

<h4 id="a-designation-segment">A. Designation Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">As explained in the preface material in Section 5 (page 9), the
NLF always designates who conducts the next operation. The designated
player is the <em>phasing</em> player and commences to:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Choose the type of operation;</li>
  <li>Choose which units participate;</li>
  <li>Specify the <em>target hex</em> of the units (if applicable).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Operation:</li>
  <li>Units:</li>
  <li>Target Hex:</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search &amp; Destroy</li>
  <li>Units: PolSec, 79 Reg.</li>
  <li>Target Hex: 5020.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search &amp; Destroy</li>
  <li>Units: 3/3/3M, 2/4/3M</li>

</ul>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search &amp; Destroy</li>
  <li>Units: 3/7/1M, 2/12, 7/1M HQ</li>
  <li>Target Hex: 4820</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="b-support-declaration-segment">B. Support Declaration Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player may:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>assign air support;</li>
  <li>assign naval support;</li>
  <li>declare free fire zones.</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.1 (page 9) contains details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 Air points</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="c-movement-segment">C. Movement Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The movement segment applies only during Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, Security, Naval Transport, or Strategic
Movement Operations.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">At the end of enemy Operating movement, any friendly units
in the ZOC and not the Target Hax may move their full movement
allowance in Reaction.</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-2">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>PolSec move to 5120</li>
  <li>70R to 5020</li>

<ul>
  <li>3/3/3M and 2/4/3M to 5020.</li>
  <li>VC PolSec does Reaction move to 5019.</li>

</ul>

<p>Reaction: PolSec unit moves Quang Ngai.</p>

<h4 id="d-alert-segment-only-in-us-operations">D. Alert Segment (only in US operations)</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The Alert segment only applies during allied Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, amd Bombardment Operations. The Operating
player may perform Interdiction (7.5.2); the NLF player may
Alert (4.8).</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-3">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-3">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Interdiction 1 level from Cruiser.</li>
  <li>VC roll 5, MA is 5 (roll) + 1 (cultivated terrain) - 2 (scenario) = 4 MP</li>
  <li>VC spend 2 to leave hex, +1 interdiction, +1 enter 4920.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-3">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Interdict 4820 with 4 Air and 2 Artillery</li>
  <li>VC roll 4 + 3 - 2 = 5.</li>
</ul>

with a VC win.</p>

<h3 id="game-turn-indication-phase">5. Game Turn Indication Phase</h3>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Here's the situation at the end of the game</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/vietnam-1965-1975/starlite/g4-end.jpg" alt="Game 4 Operation Starlite end" /></p>

<p>Very interesting, and very clever with the VC Political
Section, which makes it really hard to figure out where
to land the firepower. I think perhaps the example in the
Playbook was possibly the worst move by the VC coupled
with the best move by the Marines. This scenario bears
playing through a few more times to get it figured out.</p>

<p>As it also turns out, this is not that bad. It's a bit
involved like OCS, but pretty straightforward when
considering the actual conditions on the ground. The VC
<em>did</em> slip away a lot.</p>

<p>And, I knocked it out in about two and half hours.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
