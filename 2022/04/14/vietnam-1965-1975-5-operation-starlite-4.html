<p>NOTE: this game was started April 14, and concluded April 16.</p>

<p>My previous play went so well I thought I'd fire up another one.
Because there are so few VC counters in this scenario, it's super
easy to randomize them. When one is flipped, the other is known.
I will again attempt this without any recourse to the Playbook
worked scenario.</p>

<p>The goal for this game is to get a better grip on how strategy
and tactics interact between the FWA and the NLF. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NLF will attempt to evade completely, no offensive combat,
and defense only when failing Alert and Reaction rolls.</li>
  <li>FWA, in this case USMC, wants to eliminate VC combat
capability.</li>
  <li>FWA needs to find the VC regiment, and put as much
fire support on it as possible. Two keys:
    <ol>
      <li>Finding it.</li>
      <li>Ensuring enough Fire Support.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As a secondary goal, I plan on charting out the Search
&amp; Destroy Operation into a bigger, more visual flowchart
which I can use for interruptible solitaire playing. To that
end I'm resurrecting an old notebook from a seismic review
continuing education course from 2004. It's mostly empty,
will be a good use for it.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<h3 id="support-phase">1. Support Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player indicates available air, airmobile, and riverine support
on his record sheet, placing appropriate markers on the General
Record Track.</p>

<p>From the scenario rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>US: 4 Airpoints</li>
  <li>US: 1 Airmobile</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="special-operations-designation-phase">2. Special Operations Designation Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The US player notes any units on holding or patrol operations.</li>
  <li>The NLF also notes units on holding or patrol operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>No Special Operations for either faction.</p>

<h3 id="strategic-movement-phase">3. Strategic Movement Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player may conduct security operations and employ strategic
and naval movement.</p>

<p>No Strategic Movement this turn.</p>

<h3 id="operations-phase">4. Operations Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The heart of the Vietnam <em>1965-1975</em> game is the <em>operation</em>.
The three main things to remember about operations are:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The NLF player always determines who performs the next operation,
and may choose to pass in favor of the US player performing an
operation (Section 5, page 9).</li>
  <li>Each unit may perform only one operation per turn (Section 2.2, page 5).</li>
  <li>Operations proceed as a series of <em>rounds</em> until the US declines is
unable to perform further operations. The NLF then decides to either
continue operations or end the Operations Phase (Section 5, page 9).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operations are explained in brief in Section 2.2, page 5,
and described in detail in Section 5, page 9 of the rules.</p>

<h4 id="a-designation-segment">A. Designation Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">As explained in the preface material in Section 5 (page 9), the
NLF always designates who conducts the next operation. The designated
player is the <em>phasing</em> player and commences to:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Choose the type of operation;</li>
  <li>Choose which units participate;</li>
  <li>Specify the <em>target hex</em> of the units (if applicable).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Operation:</li>
  <li>Units:</li>
  <li>Target Hex:</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search &amp; Destroy</li>
  <li>Units: PolSec, 70th Regiment (70R).</li>
  <li>Target Hex: 5220.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>Now I have a decision to make. Should I go all-in on
one hex with a 50% chance it's the 70R. If it is, I can
probably win it. If not, it's a loss. Or should I attempt
to reveal the 70R first, then I will know what to do in
Operation 3. The risk is that the 70R will succeed on Alert
movement, which will be game over and NLF win, almost surely.
The NLF loses on Dispersal or Breakdown, so it's in their
interest to stand and fight.</p>

<p>I'm going to replicate the Playbook, and use 3/3/3M to
reveal the VC at 5020.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search &amp; Destroy</li>
  <li>Units: 3/3/3M</li>
  <li>Target Hex: 5020.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<p>Having suffered a severe blow by having 70R nearly
escape the battlefield, USMC goes all in for the third
operation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search &amp; Destroy</li>
  <li>Units: 2/4/3M, 2/12, 3/7/1M, 7/1M</li>
  <li>Target Hex: 4921.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="b-support-declaration-segment">B. Support Declaration Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player may:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>assign air support;</li>
  <li>assign naval support;</li>
  <li>declare free fire zones.</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.1 (page 9) contains details.</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-1">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-1">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>Decision time again: USMC could choose to use
Naval support for interdiction, in case 70R
is revealed, which would make it harder for 70R to
succeed at an Alert movement. Let's follow the
Playbook and not declare it here.</p>

<p>Upshot: no support declared.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-1">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>4 Air points</li>
  <li>6 Naval, can't use at the start of the operation,
but if a VC retreats into range, will be useful then.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="c-movement-segment">C. Movement Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The movement segment applies only during Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, Security, Naval Transport, or Strategic
Movement Operations.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operating player moves any units assigned to the current
operation; may enter ZOCs and Target Hex, may move <em>through</em>
enemy hexes (and be subject to Incidental Attacks [4.11]).
Airmobile points may be used.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">REACTION: At the end of enemy Operating movement, any friendly units
in the ZOC and not the Target Hax may move their full movement
allowance in Reaction. [4.9]</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-2">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>As I'm playing the VC blind, I do not yet know which unit
moved where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unit moves to 5020</li>
  <li>Unit moves to 5120.</li>
</ul>

<p>The USMC cannot React as its the Target Hex.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-2">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>3/3/3M moves to 5020, reveals 70R!</p>

<p>Reaction: PolSec moves to 5019.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-2">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>3/7/1M: 4921.</li>
  <li>7/1M: 5020.</li>
  <li>2/12: 5020.</li>
  <li>2/4/3M: 4920.</li>
</ul>

<p>REACTION: VC PolSec to 5119.</p>

<h4 id="d-alert-segment-only-in-us-operations">D. Alert Segment (only in US operations)</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The Alert segment only applies during allied Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, amd Bombardment Operations. The Operating
player may perform Interdiction [7.5.2]; the NLF player may
Alert [4.8].</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-3">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-3">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>Alert roll: 6!</p>

<ul>
  <li>roll: 6</li>
  <li>terrain: 1</li>
  <li>scenario: -2</li>
  <li>total: 5</li>
</ul>

<p>VC moves, spend:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leave target hex: 2</li>
  <li>enter forested hills: 3</li>
  <li>total: 5.</li>
</ul>

<p>Need 5, have 5, Alert movement successful. This is really interesting
as any other roll than 6 would have pinned the VC. So I need to play this
again with the same setup. I think perhaps with an abridged writeup to
speed up play.</p>

<p>I suspect this might be the game, as the Cruiser points are lost,
so Interdiction would come from other support. Hard to say
whether that's good thing or not, depends on whether it makes
a column shift.</p>

<p>Worth noting, during the next Operation, the Alert roll for 70R
is going to be +3 for terrain.</p>

<p>NOTE: Had I assigned Naval support, I could have called for Interdiction
at this point, and pinned the VC down.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-3">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<p>Alert roll for 70R: 3 + 3 (terrain) for 6 - 2 = 4.
Needs: 2 (leave target hex) + 1 to 5021. This may not be a great
move, as it is a worse defensive position, but it's the only
move the VC can make. The alternative is staying in the hills,
which keeps 2/4/3M in contact for combat.</p>

<h4 id="e-combat-segment">E. Combat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The Combat segment only applies during Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, Security, and Bombardment Operations.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Units ending movement in a Target Hex <strong>must</strong> have
combat; units ending movement <strong>adjacent</strong> to enemy
hexes <strong>may</strong> declare combat. If combat is not declared
after movement, the Operation ends immediately. Specifically,
Operations without a Target Hex, or when a Target Hex
cannot be declared end immediately on conclusion of
movement.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">INTERDICTION: Either or both players declare interdiction
here. [7.5.2]</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-4">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>No combat, this Operation concludes.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/vietnam-1965-1975/starlite/g5-vc-op.jpg" alt="End of VC operations" /></p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-4">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>With 1:2 odds, and the VC in advantageous terrain, I'm passing
on Combat this Operation, which concludes 3/3/3M's participation.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-4">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<p>Round 1</p>

<ul>
  <li>2/4/3M against VC 70R, odds 1:2, DRM -2.</li>
</ul>

<p>(<strong>Blunder: did not add 1/2 ground support to determine Attack
and Defense strengths.</strong>)</p>

<p>Roll 3 - 2 for 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC: 6 + 9 = 15, results, lose 2 REPL.</li>
  <li>USMC: 3 + 2 = 5, results, lose 2. Dang.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: full supporting fire up to 3x ground combat strength
used for determining losses.</p>

<hr />

<p>Round 2</p>

<p>2/4/3/M vs 70R, odds 1:2, DRM -2 for odds, -2 for terrain,
roll 1 - 4 = 3,</p>

<ul>
  <li>70R: 6 + 9 (adding naval support) = 15,  lose 1 VC REPL, -4 Pursuit.</li>
  <li>USMC: 3 + 2 = 5, lose 1 US REPL.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="f-retreat-segment">F. Retreat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Applies to Security Operations as well. Defending player
may move their full Movement Point allowance. If the FWA
are non-Operating, they may active Defensive Reserves [6.10.2].</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-5">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-5">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-5">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<p>VC retreat to 5022. Can USMC Pursue? Let's find out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Round 2, VC retreat to 4923.</p>

<h4 id="g-pursuit-segment">G. Pursuit Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operating units may Pursue (FWA and NLF).
FWA may activate Offensive Reserves if he is
the Operating player [6.10.2].</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-6">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-6">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-6">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>3/7/1M pursues to 5021.</li>
  <li>2/4/3M, need 2.5 MP to Airmobilize, with -2 Pursuit,
can't do it.</li>
  <li>No other unit can pursue.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Round 2, no pursuit possible so that's the game.</p>

<h4 id="h-interdiction-removal-segment">H. Interdiction Removal Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Remove all Interdiction markers from the map.</p>

<h4 id="i-continuous-operations-combat-segment">I. Continuous Operations Combat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Now return to Segment and and repeat until neither player is able or
willing to conduct an operation.</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-7">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-7">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-7">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<p>Rewind to combat segment and repeat for Round 2.</p>

<h3 id="game-turn-indication-phase">5. Game Turn Indication Phase</h3>

<p>Turn 1 complete and conclusion of scenario.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>VC win.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/vietnam-1965-1975/starlite/g5-end.jpg" alt="VC escaped the USMC" /></p>

<p>As it turned out, I did refer to the scenario example
playthrough to get some clarity on certain decisions
such as declaring support. The example playthrough,
however, is not explicit in some places.</p>

<p>Also, I made a blunder on the first combat round: it
should have been -4 DRM instead of -2. I forgot to
take terrain into account. Round 1 would have been the
end of the game.</p>

<p>Another blunder: I did not add the ground support fire when
determining combat odds. Given the above blunder with respect
to terrain, the outcome probably would have been the same,
<em>in this case</em>.</p>

<p>One question: what's the sequence when moving through
a VC Political Section? It has a ZOC, but 0 combat
strength. Does it induce Incidental Attack? How would
the odds be figured? Could the unit decide to not reveal
and not perform Incidental Attacks?</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
