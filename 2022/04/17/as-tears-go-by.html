As Tears Go By
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 17 2022</time>
<p>This will be my third High Flying Dice Games treatment of tactical
battles in Vietnam. As usual, the game uses a card draw mechanic,
which I find inconvenient, and not particularly compelling. However,
I'm not sure there are <em>any</em> other games treating Operation Starlite
as its own battle, so it's worthwhile for that reason alone.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>VC Artillery strikes: 2.</p>

<p>USMC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Artillery: 2 - 2 = 0.</li>
  <li>Air: 4 (roll 6 + 1 day turn)</li>
  <li>Naval: 4 (roll 6 + 1 day turn)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the start of the game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/as-tears-go-by/g1-setup.jpg" alt="Setup" /></p>

<p>I'm starting to fade, time to gear down: Who goes first? It's by
card draw activation. So let's draw: Black 3, USMC gets 1 activation
plus 1 activation for Morale 7, total 2.</p>

<h3 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Draw black 3. J/3/3, I/3/3 to I7.</li>
  <li>black 4, J/3/3, I/3/3 to J7.</li>
  <li>black 7, J/3/3, I/3/3 attack VC 3/60
  - draw 6
  - concealed -1 = 5
  - AF +6 = 11
  Score: USMC 1, VC 0.</li>
  <li>red 9, let's do some VC artillery, which is actually 0,
modifying the setup. With no artillery this turn, VC are
going to pass. Side note, I think I need to read the play
throughs for the other two games I've played in this series.</li>
  <li>red 8, 1/60 moves to Sampan.</li>
  <li>red 8, move units towards the coast to make sampan escapes.</li>
  <li>black 3, move.</li>
  <li>block 5, move 3 of the airborne units to G3.</li>
  <li>block K, combat in G3, VC 3/40 and 4/40, with attackers
E, G, H of 2/4.
  - draw 6
  - concealed: -1 for 5
  - AF: 9 for 14
  - DF: -8 for 6
  - This is a whiff.</li>
  <li>black 8, I/3/3, J/3/3 move to J8.</li>
  <li>black Q, I,J/3/3 combat in J8, 3/60 defends.
  - draw 6
  - DF: -6 for 0
  - AF: +6 for 6
  - VC with 6 DF successfully defend.</li>
  <li>black Ace, D/1/7 to D2.</li>
  <li>red Q, 1/60, 3/60 to sampan. I think I played this one wrong,
the 1/60 was already on sampan. No big deal. 2/45 to sampan.</li>
  <li>black Q, L,M/3/3 and A/3 to H5.</li>
  <li>red 7, 1/45, 3/45 to C6; 4/60 to G6. This is going to subject
4/60 to opportunity fire, which we're going to call in as Naval:
  - roll 6
  - stronghold -1 for 5
  - DF: -4 for 1.
  - Result, movement successful.</li>
  <li>black K, combat in G3, E,G,H/2/4 against VC 3/40, 4/40:
  - draw 4
  - DF: -8 for -4
  - AF: +9 for 5
  - Concealed: -1 for 4
  - USMC arty: +1 for 5
  - Result: miss.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>I'm calling the game here as work concerns are making it difficult
to pay attention to it. I'm also going to play again with my usual
opponent, in the near future. I'll need to get a spare copy of the
rules printed up before then.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>As usual for these HFD games, the rules have contrradictions, are not
clear, and also contradict the player aid card. There is needless
complexity in the combat subsystem, a lot of modifier have to be
accounted for, too many to memorize, and the writing is unclear.</p>

<p>I would normally browse forums and ask questions, but I just don't
want to get into it. If the designer posted the rules publically,
I'd consider investing some effort into cleaning them up.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
