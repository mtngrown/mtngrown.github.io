Vietnam 1965-1975; 9 - Operation Starlite (8)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  1 2022</time>
<p>At 3:30 pm, it's pretty late in the day on Sunday afternoon for me to
fire up a new game, but this is such a short scenario that I can
surely play it out over the week quite easily. In this case, I'm
focusing again on playing more or less the Playbook example. The
idea is to play until I can't get it wrong.</p>

<p>The focus this game is getting more comfortable with artillery
employment.</p>

<h2 id="turn-sequence">Turn Sequence</h2>

<h3 id="support-phase">1. Support Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player indicates available air, airmobile, and riverine support
on his record sheet, placing appropriate markers on the General
Record Track.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 Airmobile point</li>
  <li>4 Air support points</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="special-operations-designation-phase">2. Special Operations Designation Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The US player notes any units on holding or patrol operations.</li>
  <li>The NLF also notes units on holding or patrol operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3 id="strategic-movement-phase">3. Strategic Movement Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player may conduct security operations and employ strategic
and naval movement.</p>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3 id="operations-phase">4. Operations Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The heart of the Vietnam <em>1965-1975</em> game is the <em>operation</em>.
The three main things to remember about operations are:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The NLF player always determines who performs the next operation,
and may choose to pass in favor of the US player performing an
operation (Section 5, page 9).</li>
  <li>Each unit may perform only one operation per turn (Section 2.2, page 5).</li>
  <li>Operations proceed as a series of <em>rounds</em> until the US declines is
unable to perform further operations. The NLF then decides to either
continue operations or end the Operations Phase (Section 5, page 9).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operations are explained in brief in Section 2.2, page 5,
and described in detail in Section 5, page 9 of the rules.</p>

<h4 id="a-designation-segment">A. Designation Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">As explained in the preface material in Section 5 (page 9), the
NLF always designates who conducts the next operation. The designated
player is the <em>phasing</em> player and commences to:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Choose the type of operation;</li>
  <li>Choose which units participate;</li>
  <li>Specify the <em>target hex</em> of the units (if applicable).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Operation:</li>
  <li>Units:</li>
  <li>Target Hex:</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search &amp; Destroty</li>
  <li>Units: both VC</li>
  <li>Target Hex: 5220</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Operation: Search &amp; Destroy</li>
  <li>Units: 2/4/3M</li>
  <li>
    <p>Target Hex: 5020</p>
  </li>
  <li>Operation: Search &amp; Destroy</li>
  <li>Units: 3/3/3M, 2/12, 7/1M, 3/7/1M</li>
  <li>Target Hex: 4820</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="b-support-declaration-segment">B. Support Declaration Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player may:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>assign air support;</li>
  <li>assign naval support;</li>
  <li>declare free fire zones.</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.1 (page 9) contains details.</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-1">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-1">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>No support declared this operation.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>4 Air</li>
  <li>Naval is out of range</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="c-movement-segment">C. Movement Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The movement segment applies only during Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, Security, Naval Transport, or Strategic
Movement Operations.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operating player moves any units assigned to the current
operation; may enter ZOCs and Target Hex, may move <em>through</em>
enemy hexes (and be subject to Incidental Attacks [4.11]).
Airmobile points may be used.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">REACTION: At the end of enemy Operating movement, any friendly units
in the ZOC and not the Target Hax may move their full movement
allowance in Reaction. [4.9]</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-2">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>Move to 5020 and 5120. Ops complete.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-2">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>Move 2/4/3M to 5020.</p>

<p>Reaction: VC unit in 5120 moves to 5019.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-1">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<p>This is a little complex:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Airmobile 7/1M to 4721</li>
  <li>2/12 to 5020</li>
  <li>3/3/3M to 4920</li>
  <li>3/7/1M to 6920</li>
</ul>

<p>These units are 1 MP short of being able to get into the hills.
The VC Political Section ZOC is costing a lot of MP.</p>

<p>Reaction: Political Section moves to 5219.</p>

<h4 id="d-alert-segment-only-in-us-operations">D. Alert Segment (only in US operations)</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The Alert segment only applies during allied Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, amd Bombardment Operations. The Operating
player may perform Interdiction [7.5.2]; the NLF player may
Alert [4.8].</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-3">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-3">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>VC roll 4 + 1 terrain for 5 - 2 scenario, 3 MP allowed. VC Alert
moves to 4920.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-2">Operation 3. USMC</h5>

<p>VC roll 2 + 3 terrain -2 scenario -1 ZOC net 2 cannot move
anywhere better than where they are right now.</p>

<h4 id="e-combat-segment">E. Combat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The Combat segment only applies during Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, Security, and Bombardment Operations.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Units ending movement in a Target Hex <strong>must</strong> have
combat; units ending movement <strong>adjacent</strong> to enemy
hexes <strong>may</strong> declare combat. If combat is not declared
after movement, the Operation ends immediately. Specifically,
Operations without a Target Hex, or when a Target Hex
cannot be declared end immediately on conclusion of
movement.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">GROUND SUPPORT may be declared with artillery, naval, and air.
Increase Attack and Defense Factors by up to 3x ground combat
strength with either: 1/2 the amount of declared
support, or; full declared support if Free Fire is declared.
Full support strength is used when determining losses.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">INTERDICTION: Either or both players declare interdiction
here. [7.5.2]</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-4">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-4">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>No interdiction, 2/4/3M attacks VC in 4920, which is
revealed to be 70 Regiment (70R). Bad luck for USMC.</p>

<p>Combat odds: 3:8, DRM -2 (or -3?).</p>

<p>USMC roll 2 -2 DRM for 0.</p>

<p>Casualties:
- VC Defender: 6 + 0 = 6, 0 losses.
- USMC Attacker: 3 + 2, 0 losses.</p>

<p>Very lucky for USMC.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-3">Operation 3. USMC</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Round 1:
    <ul>
      <li>Attack with 6 + (19 / 2) = 15.5</li>
      <li>Defense 6 + 2.</li>
      <li>Odds: 3:2, DRM + 1.</li>
      <li>Roll 3 + 1 odds - 3 terrain for 1
        <ul>
          <li>Defender casualties: 6 + 9.5 = 15.5, lose 2 Repl.</li>
          <li>Attacker casualties: 6 + 2 = 8, lose 3. Dang. Pursuit -1.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is not looking good for USMC.</p>

<h4 id="f-retreat-segment">F. Retreat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Applies to Security Operations as well. Defending player
may move their full Movement Point allowance. If the FWA
are non-Operating, they may active Defensive Reserves [6.10.2].</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-5">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-5">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>VC retreat to 4820.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-4">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<p>VC retreat to 4720, they can just do it with 4 MP.</p>

<h4 id="g-pursuit-segment">G. Pursuit Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operating units may Pursue (FWA and NLF).
FWA may activate Offensive Reserves if he is
the Operating player [6.10.2].</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-vc-6">Operation 1, VC</h5>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-6">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>2/4/3M can pursue into 4920.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-5">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<p>Cannot do any pursuit with any units as I need
3 MP to get into the hills, and only have 2 with the -1
modifier from the combat round.</p>

<h4 id="h-interdiction-removal-segment">H. Interdiction Removal Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Remove all Interdiction markers from the map.</p>

<h4 id="i-continuous-operations-combat-segment">I. Continuous Operations Combat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Now return to Segment and and repeat until neither player is able or
willing to conduct an operation.</p>

<h5 id="operation-1-recap">Operation 1 (recap)</h5>

<p>VC just moved to try and escape the gauntlet.</p>

<h5 id="operation-2-usmc-7">Operation 2, USMC</h5>

<p>Will not continue with another round.</p>

<h5 id="operation-3-usmc-6">Operation 3, USMC</h5>

<p>Cannot continue due to lack of pursuit.</p>

<h3 id="game-turn-indication-phase">5. Game Turn Indication Phase</h3>

<p>End of Turn 1 is end of this game.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I'm playing this scenario until I "can't get it wrong."</p>

<p>It's a good scenario for learning the game. I think it's slanted to
the VC, but that may be because the VC don't really have to do much
more than bluff the USMC and hope to get lucky die rolls for Alert
movement.</p>

<p>The USMC on the other hand, has to account for spending an operation
which might either be a no op, or very bloody.</p>

<p>For the third operation, I might should have brought in
an infantry unit Airmobile into hot LZ which would pin
the VC and not allow a retreat. Then the 7/1M HQ unit
could stay in the plains and still be adjacent.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is using interdiction early.
It might whiff, but the chance of whiffing early is
better than having it surely whiff as the VC alert and
retreat out of range.</p>

<p>Need to play this again!</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
