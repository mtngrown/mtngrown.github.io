Vietnam 1965-1975; 10 - Operation Starlite (9)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  3 2022</time>
<p>Another round of Operation Starlite, this time with reduced logging.
I'm not bringing in the full turn sequence, will focus on logging
just the operations in a minimal way, with emphasis on tactics
discussion. To keep things on track, I have the Search &amp; Destroy
flowchart handy.</p>

<h2 id="operation-1">Operation 1</h2>

<p>VC move to 5020 and 5120, I don't know which VC unit is which.</p>

<p>There is nothing more of consequence to write of at the moment.</p>

<h2 id="operation-2">Operation 2</h2>

<p>USMC needs to figure out which unit is the VC Political Section
so it can bear down the regiment. Too this end, 5020 is declared
the Target Hex, 3/3/3M moves to 5020.</p>

<p>The VC in 5120 moves to 5019.</p>

<p>6 points of Naval are fired for Offensive Interdiction.</p>

<p>Alert roll, 2. VC are pinned in 5020.</p>

<h3 id="round-1">Round 1</h3>

<p>3/3/3M attacks, revealing the 70R.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attacker: 3 + 4 Air for 7.</li>
  <li>Defender: 6 + 2 support for 8.</li>
</ul>

<p>Odds 2:3, DRM -1.</p>

<p>Roll 3 - 1 (drm) for 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC loss: 1 Repl.</li>
  <li>USMC loss: 1 Repl.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not bad.</p>

<p>Retreat: +2 for enemy occupied hex, +1 for interdiction. Looks like
they can retreat 1 MP to 4920.</p>

<p>Pursuit: the USMC is going to stay where it is and apply at least 1,
possibly all 3 pursuit points to the next round of combat. Will need
to read some rules on this. From 6.7.4, there is no explicit mention
of Interdiction effects on Pursuit.</p>

<p>Offensive Reserves: Pile on! Bringing all of them in while I still
have Air support. Too bad about Naval. Here's the movements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2/12 to 5020</li>
  <li>7/1M to 4820, Airmobile</li>
  <li>2/4/3M to 4919</li>
  <li>3/7/1M to 4920</li>
</ul>

<p>Reaction: VC Political Section move to 5119.</p>

<p>Remove interdiction and start Round 2.</p>

<h3 id="round-2">Round 2</h3>

<p>We can attack again, with Offensive Interdiction of 6,
reducing potential support to 13. But this really pins
them down.</p>

<ul>
  <li>USMC: 3 AF + 6.5 support for 9.5.</li>
  <li>VC: 6 DF + 2 support for 8.</li>
</ul>

<p>DRM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Odds 1:1 no DRM.</li>
  <li>Pursuit: +3</li>
</ul>

<p>Casualties: roll 1 + 3 for 4.</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC: 6 + 6.5 = 12.5, lose 1 Repl.</li>
  <li>USMC: 3 + 2 = 5, lose 1 Repl.</li>
</ul>

<p>Retreat: VC cannot retreat having been interdicted.</p>

<p>Pursuit: +1</p>

<p>No more offensive reserves, end of Round 2</p>

<h3 id="round-3">Round 3</h3>

<p>No interdiction this round, pile on with the support to
see if we can take out the VC.</p>

<ul>
  <li>AF: 6 + 9.5 support = 12.5. This is risky, rolling a 2 reduces USMC to 0 Repl.</li>
  <li>DF: 6 + 2 support = 8.</li>
</ul>

<p>DRM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>odds: 3:2 for +1.</li>
  <li>Pursuit roll: +1</li>
  <li>Pursuit unit: +3</li>
</ul>

<p>Casualties, do not roll a 2, roll 3 + 5 = 8. Pursuit +4.</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC: 6 + 9.5 = 15.5, lose 1! Dang!</li>
  <li>USMC: 6 + 2 = 8, lose 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Retreat: VC to 5019, which removes 8 support from USMC,
but adds the cruiser back in.</p>

<p>No reserves, proceed to Round 4.</p>

<h3 id="round-4">Round 4</h3>

<p>AF: 6 + 7 (2/12) + 6 (naval) + 4 (air) = 6 + 8.5 = 14.5
DF: 6 + 2 = 8.</p>

<p>DRM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Odds: +1</li>
  <li>Pursuit roll: +4</li>
  <li>Pursuit unit: +3</li>
  <li>Total: +8</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, any roll will take out 1 Repl of VC, the only
question is how many USMC are lost. With +8, I don't think
any.</p>

<p>Casualties: roll 2 + 8 = 10.</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC: lose 4 Repl.</li>
  <li>USMC: lose 1 Repl.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a win for the USMC.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The VC failed the Alert roll in Operation 2. What would have happened
if they succeeded in the Alert roll? This is worth gaming out.</p>

<p>USMC should have put 2/12 in the hills, big blunder. However, the
only retreat route puts the VC right back into Naval gunfire range.</p>

<p>Here's the situation at the start of Round 4:</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
