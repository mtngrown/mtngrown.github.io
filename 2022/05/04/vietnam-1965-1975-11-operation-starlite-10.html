Vietnam 1965-1975; 11 - Operation Starlite (10)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May  4 2022</time>
<p>Operation Starlite continues to entertain. In the previous play
I brought in Offensive Reserves, and it was awesome. I did not
do a hot LZ airmobile operation, which is something I want to
do, perhaps in this game. I'll be doing reduced logging again
with the Search &amp; Destroy flowchart in hand. Let's get on with
the show.</p>

<h2 id="operation-1-vc">Operation 1, VC</h2>

<p>VC make their usual move to 5020 and 5120. As usual I do not
know which unit is which, the USMC will have to mount a Search &amp;
Destroy operation to determine that.</p>

<p>Since the VC do not want to fight, they are Ops Complete.</p>

<h2 id="operation-2-usmc">Operation 2, USMC</h2>

<p>Search &amp; Destroy by 2/4/3M with Target Hex 5020.</p>

<p>Move: 2/4/3M moves to 5020.</p>

<p>Reaction: VC in 5120 moves to 5019.</p>

<p>Support: Naval, I want to interdict, and willing to spend the
points to trap the unit if it's a regiment.</p>

<p>Interdiction: 6 points of Naval for 1 Interdiction level.</p>

<p>Alert: roll 5 - 2 scenario - 2 enemy - 1 interdiction = 0. This is
interesting as had I not interdicted, the alert move would have
succeeded.</p>

<h3 id="round-1">Round 1</h3>

<p>Attack: 2/4/3M reveals 70R again.</p>

<p>DRM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Odds: 3:8  is 1:3, which is -3 DRM, which is not good. I didn't
bring any Air support in on this operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Casualties: roll 4 - 3 for 1, pursuit -1.</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC: 6, lose 1 repl</li>
  <li>USMC: 5, lose 2 repl. Rolling a 4 wasn't the worst roll,
but it wasn't bad either.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe should have had 1-2 Air points to get the odds to 1:2.</p>

<p>Retreat: 6 - 2 scenario - 2 enemy in hex - 1 interdiction = 1,
70R moves to 4920.</p>

<p>Pursuit: carry forward +2 pursuit into next round.</p>

<p>Activation Reserves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2/12: 4820 Airmobilized.</li>
  <li>3/3/3M: 4919.</li>
  <li>3/7/1M: 4920.</li>
  <li>7/1M HQ: 5020.</li>
  <li>Cruiser: 5218.</li>
</ul>

<p>Interdiction removed.</p>

<h3 id="round-2">Round 2</h3>

<p>I need to get a little bit luck with the die rolls, or the USMC will lose.</p>

<p>No offensive interdiction.</p>

<p>Combat factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>USMC: 3 + 21 / 2 support = 12.5 = 12</li>
  <li>VC: 8</li>
</ul>

<p>DRM</p>

<ul>
  <li>odds: 3:2, +1  DRM</li>
  <li>pursuit: +2</li>
  <li>total: +3</li>
</ul>

<p>Casualties, roll 3 + 6 for 6, +2 Pursuit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC: loses 2.</li>
  <li>USMC: loses 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tie game.</p>

<p>Retreat: 70R to 5019.</p>

<p>Pursuit: 3/7/1M pursues to 5019.</p>

<h3 id="round-3">Round 3</h3>

<p>3/3/3/M attacks.</p>

<p>Factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>USMC: 3 + 21/2  =&gt; 12.</li>
  <li>VC: 6 + 2 = 8.</li>
</ul>

<p>DRM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>odds: +1</li>
  <li>unit pursuit bonus: +3</li>
  <li>pursuit bonus from die: +2</li>
  <li>total: +6</li>
</ul>

<p>Casualties, roll 4 + 6 for 10, pursuit +6</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC: 6 + 12.5 = 18.5 lose 4 repls.</li>
  <li>USMC: 3 + 2 = 5, lose 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>USMC wins again!</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I've blundered in the past by not moving the cruiser to
stay in range. That was dumb.</p>

<p>Winning looks like being able to trap the VC, then driving
up the DRMs with pursuit modifiers.</p>

<p>I'd really like to see how it plays out when a Political
Section is the first encounter. Without it being completely
random, very difficult for me to play a realistic decision.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
