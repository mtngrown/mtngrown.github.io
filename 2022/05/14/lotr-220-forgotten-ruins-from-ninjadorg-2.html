LotR 220 - Forgotten Ruins from Ninjadorg (2)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>May 14 2022</time>

<p>Another play using the <a href="http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/26569/ninjadorg2-theoldforest-1.0">Ninjadorg Old
Forest</a>.
I don't think this deck works that well, but it was too long ago that I
played the first time. I'll use the results of this game to tweak it.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Son of Arnor</li>
  <li>For Gondor!</li>
  <li>Steward of Gondor</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Ever Vigilant</li>
  <li>Ever Vigilant</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Valiant Sacrifice.</li>
  <li>Planning: Steward on Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Despair for no effect.
Net +5 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Galadhrims's Greeting.</li>
  <li>Planning: Galadhrim's Greeting, threat 24. Play
Son of Arnor.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, draw The Brown Lands, Threat 28.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Brown Lands.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: nothing, no allies.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, Aragorn, draw Wargs, net +1
Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wargs</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends, shadow Goblin Sniper, 1 hit on
Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: This is going to be an interesting round.
I'm going to use Sneak Attack Gandalf on this one if
I can quest through to get Ungoliant's Spawn in play.
The idea is do 4 hits direct, use as defender, then
Ever Vigilant to ready Gandalf to help with attack.
The bummer would be if I don't clear the quest. I'll
use Eowyn and Aragorn. I may have to use Son of Arnor
to deal with Wargs.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Aragorn, Theodred, draw Dol Guldur Orcs,
2 hits on Theodred. Stage 1B with 9 progress, Ungoliant Spawn
comes into play.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Wargs, Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Combat: Aragorn defends Wargs, shadow Dol Guldur Orcs
for 2 hits on Aragorn. Son of Arnor defends Dol Guldur Orcs,
shadow Enchanted Stream for no effect, Son of Arnor is
destroyed. Play Valiant Sacrifice to draw Snowbourn Scout
and A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31</li>
</ol>

<p>Looking pretty dicey, but who knows what will happen? This
game could end next turn, or I could get a win.</p>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 19, draw Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Unexpected Courage on Aragorn. Play Snowbourn
Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Tower Gate. Now, do I want to pitch a card
to keep Ungoliant's Spawn in the staging for one more turn? Or
bring Ungoliant Spawn out this turn? Pitching one of the Ever
Vigilants, Ungoliant's Spawn stays in Staging.</li>
  <li>Travel: none. (Watch what I do with Stand and Fight)</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends Wargs, shadow Misty Mountain
Goblins to remove 1 progress from quest. No big deal. Snowbourn
Scout is dead. Play Stand and Fight to bring Snawbourn Scout
back, place 1 progress to remove Tower Gate, and defend against
Dol Guldur Orcs, shadow The East Bight for no effect, Snowbourn
Scout is dead. Aragorn and Theodred kill Wargs, Aragorn kills
Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ungoliant's Spawn coming out next turn, I don't have any way
to reduce threat.</p>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 19, draw Son of Arnor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Son of Arnor and engage Ungoliant's Spawn
to get it out of the staging area so it won't contribute
threat.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Wolf Rider, surge Endless Caverns surge
King Spider, exhaust Son of Arnor. Threat 33 from Endless Caverns.</li>
  <li>Travel: Endless Caverns.</li>
  <li>Encounter: King Spider, Wolf Rider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Sneak Attack Gandalf to defend Ungoliant's Spawn, shadow
Dungeon Jailer for no effect. Aragorn defends King Spider, shadow
Goblin Sniper for no effect. Theodred defends Wolf Rider, shadow
The East Bight for no effect. Play Ever Vigilant to ready
Gandalf, Aragorn and Gandalf swing for 7 to kill Ungoliant's
Spawn.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 19, draw Faramir.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Faramir. Play Gandalf for cards, draw
Steward of Gondor x 2 and Guard of the Citadel. Play Guard
of the Citadel</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Hill Troll. Dang. Net +3 progress to
clear Endless Caverns. Let's stay in this location
until Hill Troll is cleared out.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gandalf defends Hill Troll, shadow Iron Shackles.
Gandalf takes no hits. Aragorn defends, shadow Under the Shadow
for Threat 37, takes no damage. Faramir defends King Spider,
shadow Marsh Adder for no effect. Son of Arnor takes out
Wolf Rider. Aragorn and Guard of the Citadel take out King
Spider.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 38.</li>
</ol>

<p>I could have canceled the King Spider "When Revealed," and
maybe should have as Son of Arnor would be ready and able to
kill Wolf Rider.</p>

<p>I'm not in a too bad of a state, but the game is getting long
and I haven't advanced.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Iron Shackles. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Planning: none. Hopefully no surge.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Tower Gate, which is ok, it's
going to force net +2 which clears 1B, and puts
Shadow Key in play with Necromancer's Reach! Excellent.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Hill Troll already engaged.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir defends, shadow Wargs, Faramir is killed.
Aragorn, Theodred, Son of Arnor, and Guard of the Citadel
attack for 8, play For Gondor! for 12 which kills the
Hill Troll.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 39.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 18, draw Celebrian's Stone.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Aragorn, Theodred for 9, draw Mountains
of Mirkwood. Throw a Steward of Gondor to Eowyn for 10 Will,
net +6, take Shadow and Attach to Eowyn.</li>
  <li>Travel: Mountains of Mirkwood, reveal Caught in a Web
which A Test of Will cancels.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 40. Eowyn takes 1 hit.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to need healing to beat this quest I'm pretty sure.</p>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 20, draw Strength of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Aragorn, Theodred for 9, draw Eyes of the
Forest, discard all Event cards, no big deal. This clears
Mountains of Mirkwood and Stage 2b. Shadow Key is removed
from play. Excellent.</li>
  <li>Travel: Tower Gate.</li>
  <li>Encounter: "Orc Guard"</li>
  <li>Combat: Guard of the Citadel defends, shadow Mountains of
Mirkwood, 1 hit. Aragorn kills it.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 41.</li>
</ol>

<p>I might be able to win this, really depends on what the
Encounter deck throws at me. I'm hurting for card draw
really badly.</p>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 25, draw Son of Arnor, excellent.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Son of Arnor.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Great Forest Web. Throw
Steward of Gondor to Eowyn for 3 Progress, clearing
Tower Gate.</li>
  <li>Travel: Great Forest Web.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 42.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-12">Round 12</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 27, draw Hasty Stroke, which might be a game winner,
just depends on the Encounter deck now.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Aragorn, draw (this is it…) Hill Troll!
But it might not matter! It's going to matter…unless I
pull Gandalf next turn (and maybe not then) , it's done.
Just checked the deck, not Gandalf, calling it here.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Both games of this have been big boss fights. Tactics, Lore,
Spirit might be the way to go with this quest. This deck will
almost surely beat it, eventually, but it shouldn't take 12
rounds to do it.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
