Silver Bayonet 21 - Operation All The Way (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  3 2022</time>
<p>My usual Vietnam opponent and I revisited GMT's Silver Bayonet to
finally dig into a campaign scenario, in the this case Operation
All The Way which kicked off Operation Long Reach in the Ia Drang
valley in late October 1965.</p>

<p>This was a two day effort, starting yesterday July 2.</p>

<p>We've played Silver Bayonet many times in the past, but the most recent
was three and half years ago, so we're both rusty on the rules. Also, we
only a campaign scenario for a couple of turns. So it was a slow start,
finishing up Turn 1 around noon (from a 9:00 am start). Subsequent turns
went faster, and we finished off Turn 5 right after 4:00 pm. I believe
we'll be able to finish or come very close to finishing today.</p>

<p>Today we picked up at the top of Turn 6 and played through Turn 13,
where I managed to acquire an automatic victory by dint of destroying
20 steps of NVA, getting supplies to Doc Co, and eliminating an HQ.
The HQ was particularly troublesome. It took me at least 5 turns to
eliminate it. I rolled multiple 9s and 10s on both bombardment and
manuever combat, which produced no effect results for turn after
turn. Pretty crazy!.</p>

<p>We did get better with the rules today. We were playing some of it
wrong yesterday, and both of us ended up with more casualties than
we should have.</p>

<p>And as usual, the turns went faster the further into the game we got.
I suspect the campaign game would play pretty quickly once the rules
were internalized.</p>

<p>Given the full campaign is roughly double the number of turns, I believe
we could likely do a full campaign in three days. Would probably be good
to do both the other smaller campaigns first, though.</p>

<p>Here's the state at the end of the game:</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
