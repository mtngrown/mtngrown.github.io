Ho Chi Minh Trail 1
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jul  9 2022</time>
<p>I've finally done it. I'm designing my first game, with the
tentative title <em>Supply Lines of the American War: The Ho
Chi Minh Trail</em>. The title is a blatant rip off of an existing
series of games, and I won't publish it with that title, but
it's a good working title. The notion is moving enough supplies
to launch Tet '68.</p>

<p>Here's the result of the first game.</p>

<h2 id="jan-1967">Jan 1967</h2>

<p>Trail level: 6.
Budget: 6</p>

<p>Actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spend 2 for upgrade trail, level now 8.</li>
  <li>Move 4 + 8 supplies for 12. On track more or less.</li>
</ol>

<p>Response: Bombing, Level back to 6</p>

<p>Supplies: 12</p>

<h2 id="mar-1967">Mar 1967</h2>

<p>Actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spend 6 to build base.</li>

</ol>

<p>Response: Raid, destroy base</p>

<p>Supplies: 24, not looking good.</p>

<h2 id="apr-1967">Apr 1967</h2>

<p>Trail level: 6.
Budget: 6</p>

<p>Actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build base.</li>

<p>Supplies: 31.
Bases: 2.</p>

<h2 id="jun-1967">Jun 1967</h2>

<p>Trail level: 5
Budget: 6.</p>

<p>Action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>upgrade Trail to level 7.</li>
  <li>move (5 + 4) / 2 = 4 (<strong>Notes</strong> this should be (7 + 4) / 2 = 5, I'm
leaving is as-is because it's too much trouble to change everything
following without making even more errors, and it doesn't affect the
game result that much anyway.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Response: Raid</p>

<p>Supplies: 35.
Bases: 1.</p>

<h2 id="jul-1967">Jul 1967</h2>

<p>Trail level: 7
Budget: 6.</p>

<p>Actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Upgrade trail: 9.</li>
  <li>Move (9 + 4) / 2 = 6</li>

Bases: 1.</p>

<h2 id="oct-1967">Oct 1967</h2>

Budget: 6</p>

<p>Actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>upgrade trail to 12</li>
  <li>Move 16.</li>
</ul>

<p>Response: Bomb, trail level reduced to 11 because Base protects 1 level
of trail.</p>

<p>Supplies: 71
Bases: 1.</p>

<h2 id="nov-1967">Nov 1967</h2>

<p>Trail level 11.

</ul>

<p>Response: Search &amp; Destroy, roll 2 d6 for 8, Supplies now 80.
(<strong>Note</strong>: there was an error recorded here in the initial playthrough.
Supplies were subtracted from the previous turn of 88 instead of
this turn's 104.)</p>

<p>Supplies: 96 (was 80).
Bases: 1</p>

<h2 id="jan-1968">Jan 1968</h2>

<p>Trail level: 10.
Budget: 6.</p>

</ul>

<p>Response: Bomb, trail level 9.</p>

<p>Supplies: 112 (was 96).
Bases: 1.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>That was interesting. I made a couple of mistakes, as noted later.</p>

<p>The rules:</p>

<p>The game is played in 13 turns spanning January 1967 to
January 1968 inclusive. Per turn, take 2 of the following
actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build a base for 6 resources.</li>
  <li>Upgrade trail capacity by 2 for 2 resources.</li>
  <li>Once per turn, move resources to Supplies.</li>
</ol>

<p>Suffer one of the following Responses by drawing a card:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bombing:
  - with Base reduce Trail Capacity by 1.
  - without Base reduce Trail Capaity by 2.</li>
  <li>Raid: remove 1 base</li>
  <li>Search &amp; Destroy: Roll 2d6 and destroy resulting amount of supplies.</li>
</ol>

<p>Victory condition: have 100 Supplies by the end of January 1968.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Bombing reduces Trail level by 2 without a base, by 1 with a base.</li>
  <li>Bases cost 6 to build, maybe too expensive.</li>
  <li>May through Sep, Trail capacity is halved due to rainy season.</li>
  <li>Search &amp; Destroy: roll 2 d6 and subtract from total supplies.</li>
  <li>Raid destroys a base</li>
  <li>Upgrade trail: spend 2 to upgrade Trail by 2 as an action.</li>
  <li>0, 1, or 2 actions per turn.</li>
  <li>Start with Trail at level 8.</li>
  <li>Budget is 6 resources per turn.</li>
  <li>Resources not spent on base or upgrade can be moved as supplies.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is version 1.0.0 of the rules. It will increment semantically.
Micro increments will be adjustments to values. Minor increments will
be modifications or additions to actions. A major increment to the
rules version will be a substantially different game.</p>

<p>Can I computerize this to examine balance?</p>

<p>Here's the current version of the game:</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
