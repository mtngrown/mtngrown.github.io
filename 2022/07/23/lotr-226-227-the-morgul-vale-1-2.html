<p>My usual collaborator and I are back after it, attempting to wrap up
Against The Shadow with the last quest <em>The Morgul Vale</em>. We haven't
played in a month or so, it felt a little cold jumping back into it.</p>

<p><em>The Morgul Vale</em> has a reputation for being a difficult quest, and
from our two plays today, it seems warranted.</p>

<h2 id="game-1">Game 1</h2>

<p>First round loss, too many enemies, too few allies. We scooped it.</p>

<h2 id="game-2">Game 2</h2>

<p>We managed to get a good way into Stage 2 on this game, after a start
where one of the shadows put everything back into the enncounter deck
on Turn 1. This was somewhat beneficial as it allowed us build a bit
of board state before advancing to Stage 2.</p>

<p>Stage 2 went pretty well for a while, then we went under with too many
enemies and not enough allies.</p>

<p>I'm running a pretty decent tri-sphere deck, and I think I'm
going to change to a pure Tactics deck to proceed further. No progress
needs to be put on quest stages, just kill the "Captain" at each
stage to progress. Seems like the fast this can be done the better
the game is going to go.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
