LotR 234 - Ungoliant's Lair (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 25 2022</time>
<p>Continuing my play through Nonjadorg's quests, now coming into the
fifth, <em>Ungoliant's Lair</em>. I'm using my <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/30607/ninjadorg3forgottenruins-1.0">Ninjadorg 3 Forgotten Ruins
deck</a>.</p>

<p>I wasn't going to log this play, but my initial turn looked so good
I figured I'd be really mad if I didn't. As will be shawn, I have
Beorn, Stand and Fight, and Steward of Gondor in hand first turn, which
is slightly ridiculous.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>Northern Tracker</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Gleowine</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Beorn</li>
</ol>

<p>Play Gandalf's Map on Eowyn.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, draw Old Forest Road.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Beravor draws Lore of Imladris, Steward of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 28.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Steward of Gondor on Eowyn, exhaust to collect
then play Nothern Tracker, play Gleowine. I need to get a chump out.</li>
  <li>Quest: Theodred, draw Great Forest Web.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Exhaust Beravor to draw Faramir and Stand and Fight,
Gleowine draws For Gondor!</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Under The Shadow, net +1 Progress
on location.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Beravor draws Steward of Gondor and Hasty
Stroke, Gelowin draws Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I should have gotten Ungoliant into the staging area this turn,
hard to say. Probably should have pitched Beorn to Eowyn regardless.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: Unexpeted Courage to Theodred, Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker draw Old Forest Road.
The deck is softballing me. Toss Beorn to discard. Net +4 Progress,
Ungoliant's Spawn comes out.</li>
  <li>Travel: Old Forest Road, ready Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ungoliant's Spawn.</li>
  <li>Combat: Sneak Attack Gandalf for 4 direct damage, Snowbourn Scout
defedns, shadow Necromancer's Reach for no effect. Gandalf, Northern
Tracker, Theodred swing for 8 killing Ungoliant's Spawn. Beravor draws
Gandalf, Unexpected Courage; Gleowine draws Henamarth Riversong.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Henamarth Riversong.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker, draw Dungeon
Jailor, net +5, toss Faramir for +6. Old Foest Road cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Beravor draws Gleowine, Miner of the Iron Hills,
Gleowine draws Sneak Attack. Henamarth scries Iron Shackles, don't
care.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 17, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: Unexpected Courage on Beravor. Stand and Fight to
get Beorn in as I have no idea what's coming on the next quest
card.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, draw Iron Shackles, clear Stage 1 reveal <em>Twisted
Caverns</em> which prevents allies from being played or put into play!
Good call with Beorn.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Beravor draws Iron Shackles and Unexpected Courage,
Gleowinw draws Snowbourn Scout. Scry Dol Guldur Orcs.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pity I didn't play Faramir as well. This next turn will be a holding
pattern.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Miner of the Iron Hills.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker, draw Dol Guldur Orcs,
net +4, toss Steward of Gondor to make it +5 and bring out Ungoliant's
Spawn again. Better to take it down now as I have no idea what's coming
next. 2 hits on Theodred.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Dol Guldur Orcs, Ungoliant's Spawn.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends against Ungoliant, shadow Forest Gate
for no effect. Beorn defends Dol Guldur Orcs, shadow Eyes of the Forest
for no effect. Sneak Attack Gandalf for 4 damage on Ungoliant Spawn.
Ready Theodred, Beravor, with Gandalf kill Ungoliant's Spawn. Ever
Vigilant so Beorn can kill Dol Guldur Orcs. Gleowin draws The
Galadhrim's Greetings. Scry Hummerhorns, whatever.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 34.</li>
</ol>

<p>Encounter deck is definitely softballing me.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 18, draw Steward of Gondor</li>
  <li>Planning: The Galadhrim's Greetings, Threat 28.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker, draw Hummerhorns,
toss Steward of Gondor net +5, cleared Stage 2. Ok, can't
put allies or attachments in play. I'm good though, I've got
this in 2 turns no problem.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none. Beravor draws Erebor Hammersmith and Northern
Tracker, Gleowine draws The Galadrhim's Greetings. Scry King Spider,
which is going to come out.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-9">Round 9</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 20, draw Guard of the Citadel.</li>
  <li>Planning: The Galadhrim's Greetings. Threat 23.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Northern Tracker, draw King Spider
exhaust Beravor. Net +3 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: King Spider.</li>
  <li>Combat: Beorn defends, shadow Mountains of Mirkwood for no effect.
Theodred and Beravor ready and kill King Spider. Gleowine draws Guard of
the Citadel, scry Enchanted Stream.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 24.</li>
</ol>

<p>This just turned into a slog.</p>

<h4 id="round-10">Round 10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 20, draw Forest Snare. This will be helpful.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Norther Tracker, draw Enchanted Stream
for net +3 tossing Steward to Eowyn.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Ungoliant's Spawn.</li>
  <li>Combat: Beorn defends, shadow Forest Gate for no effect.
Theodred readies, with Beravor put 2 hits on the nasty spider.
Beravor readies, draws Guard of the Citadel and Henamarth Riversong.
Scry Necromancer's Reach, which I'll cancel.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 25.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-11">Round 11</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: More than I can spend.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn (toss Gandalf), Theodred, Beravor, Northen Tracker,
draw Necromancer's Reach, cancel with A Test of Will, net +6, just 1
short of clearing, dang.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gleowine defends, shadow Forest Gate for no effect.
Beravor and Theodred ready, play For Gondor! with Beorn deal 10
hits to Ungoliant, she's dead. Scry Forest Spider, doesn't matter.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 26.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-12">Round 12</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: load of resources, draw Faramir.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Beravor, etc. and we're done.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I got lucky on the draw, the encounter deck softballed me, and
I got really lucky putting Beorn into play in Stage 1. I would not
have been able to win it otherwise.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
