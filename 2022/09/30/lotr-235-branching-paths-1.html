LotR 235 - Branching Paths (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Sep 30 2022</time>
<p>(Note: The quest card had an icon on it which I did not recognize
and wasn't in the core set, so this game was played without that
set of encounter cards. As it turns out, it was the <em>Hunt for
Gollum</em> encounter set. Given the power of this deck, I believe
I would have stomped it anyway, but it does provide an excuse to
play it again.)</p>

<p>The sixth and final quest in Ninjadorg's Core set extension quests.
I'm going into it blind with the <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/30607/ninjadorg3forgottenruins-1.0">Ninjadorg 3 Forgotten
Ruins</a>
deck. If it beats this quest it will have 4 of 6 quest for the Ninjadorg
quests.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Several of these quests reward turtling to build board state. This
won't serve me well in upcoming quests. But I'm glad I played them
and I think they're really worthwhile for new players who only
have a core set.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
