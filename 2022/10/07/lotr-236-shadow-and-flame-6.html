LotR 236 - Shadow and Flame (6)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Oct  7 2022</time>
<p>(Note: I did the set up incorrectly, the initial reveal is
"one less than the number of players in the game.'")</p>

<p>I'm bringing an <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/194974">Elrond/Vilya deck</a>
to the party. Dwarves just can't manage it, which is how it played out
"historically," so we'll just regard this as a counterfactual.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Henamarth Riversong</li>
  <li>Gildor Inglorion</li>
  <li>Light of Valinor</li>
  <li>Sneak Attack</li>
  <li>Imladris Stargazer</li>
  <li>Northern Tracker</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a good hand, I'm just unlikely to get it going because
I won't have time to set up Elrond.</p>

<p>Initial Encounter: Fiery Whip.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, draw Many Thonged Whip for no effect.
Net 3 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none</li>
  <li>Combat:</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 1.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Unexpected Courage.</li>
  <li>Planning: Light of Valinor on Elrond, Henamarth,,
scry Fires in the Deep.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, Theodred, draw Fires in the Deep and
cancel with A Test of Will. Net 4 progress, need 2 more.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Durin's Bane</li>
  <li>Combat: Elrond defends, shadow Goblin Scout for no effect.
Elrond takes 3 hits. Randomly discard Northern Tracker.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 2.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 8, draw Imladris Stargazer.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Great Cave Troll.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Elrond, draw Great Cave Troll, net 2
progress to clear Stage 1.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Durin's Bane.</li>
  <li>Combat: Sneak Attack Inladris Stargazer to defend, shadow Goblin
Swordsman which goes into staging area. Random discard Unexpected
Courage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't have Vilya, and that's probably the game at this point. I need
to draw it this next round.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 11, draw A Test of Will. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Goblin Swordsman. Play Imladris Stargazer.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Elrond, draw Goblin Swordsman.
Net 0 threat increase, add 4 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Imladris Stargzer defends, shadow Chance Encounter for +1
attack, Imladris is dead. Random discard Gildor Inglorion.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 4.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 13, draw Light of Valinor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Second Hall. Ugh. Play Imladris Stargazer.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, draw Second Hall, threat +8 to 12.
Add another 4 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Imladris Stargazer defends Durin's Bane, shadow Fiery Sword.
Random discard A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 13.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 16, draw Gleowine.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Goblin Tunnels, play Gleowine.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Elrond, Theodred, draw Goblin Tunnels
for +6 threat, now 19. Add 4 progress to quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: Goblin Tunnels.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Durin's Bane.</li>
  <li>Combat: Gleowine defends, shadow Whip Lask and discard all
attachments which is Light of Valinor. Bummer. Discard Light
of Valinor as it's the only card in my hand, which is now
empty.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 20.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to get to Stage 3, which I dont' think I've done before.
I think I'm doing pretty good given I don't have Vilya. Also,
I think I could manage a dwarf deck with this now that I know
how Stage 2 operates.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource:  17, draw Sneak Attack. No help.</li>
  <li>Planning: none, Henamarth is going down.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Watchful Eyes to Theodred,
net threat +7 which is game, but Stage 2 is cleared so let's
take a look at Stage 3. Ok, this is <em>Dark Pit</em> with 11 progress
required, but clearing that sends the balrog into the pit,
with a win if 1 progress is placed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since too many enemies are going to come out this round, I'm
scooping here. But good game overall. This is totally winnable.
Will need some luck of the draw to be sure.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
