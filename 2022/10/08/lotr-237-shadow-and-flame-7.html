<p>Another round, with an updated <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/194974">Elrond/Vilya deck, version
0.10</a>. Gildor Inglorion
and a Northern Tracker were swapped out for Snowbourn Scout.
Hopefully this game will get a little further than last game,
although I didn't do too badly last game.</p>

<p>Initial Hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Northern Tracker</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Daughter of the Nimrodel</li>
  <li>Vilya</li>
</ol>

<p>Keeping it.</p>

<h2 id="game-7">Game 7</h2>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, draw Second Deep, threat
3, which means Durin's Bane comes out. Hrm.</li>
  <li>Travel: Second Deep.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Durin's Bane.</li>
  <li>Combat: Elrond defends, shadow Inner Flame which gives
Durin's Bane +3, killing Elrond and that's the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, that was fast. I could have played Gandalf with Sneak
Attack to keep the threat at 0, but I was going to do that
next round.</p>

<p>One thing is clear: Henamarth is a huge help
in this scenario, possibly the single most important card.</p>

<h2 id="game-8">Game 8</h2>

<p>Let's try again. I haven't done multiple tries like this in several
years, which is probably why my progress has slowed. The last time I
recall it was grinding through <em>Into the Pit</em>.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Henamarth Riversong</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Daughter of the Nimrodel</li>
  <li>Stand and Fight</li>
  <li>Imladris Stargazer</li>
  <li>Steward of Gondor</li>
</ol>

<p>Excellent even without Vilya.</p>

<h4 id="round-1-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Vilya.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Henamarth Riversong, scry Chance Encounter,
which is going to surge.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Theodred, Eowyn, draw Chance Encounter, surge
Mant Thonged Whip, cancel with A Test of Will. Awesome.
Net 4 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 1</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Miner of the Iron Hills</li>
  <li>Planning: play Steward of Gondor on Elrond, play
Miner of the Iron Hills. Scry The Mountain's Roots.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, Theodred, draw The Mountain's Roots,
net +3 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: The Mountain's Roots.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Durin's Bane.</li>
  <li>Combat: Miner of the Iron Hills defends, Inner Shadow
for no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 2.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 7, draw Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>Planning: play Snowbourn Scout to clear The Mountain's Roots.
Scry Ranging Goblin. Play Imladrid Stargazer and Daughter of the
Nimrodel. Stargazer scry player deck Daughter of the Nimrodel on top.
Play Vilya, exhaust Elrond/Vilya to put Daughter of the Nimrodel
in play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred 2x Daughter of the Nimrodel, draw Ranging
Goblin, toss Stand and Fight to Eowyn. Stage 1 cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Durin's Bane.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends, shadow Goblin Scout for
no effect, Ranging Goblins and The Mountain's Root shuffle
back in with a damage on Theodred.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 3.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FscCaBXgM4">According to this
playthrough</a>, I could have
put 4 progress on Stage 2 immediately.</p>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 9, draw Gandalf.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Inner Flame. Elrond/Vilya draw Faramir into play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, 1x Daughter, activate Faramir for 9 Will,
draw Inner Flame for net 5 +4 progress. Excellent.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Durin's Bane.</li>
  <li>Combat: Daughter of Nimrodel defends, shadow Many Thonged Whip
for no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 4.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-5">Round 5</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 14, draw Sneak Attack.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Second Hall, nasty. Stargazer scrys Stand and Fight
on top. Some fancy business coming up.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Daughter, Sneak Attack Gandalf, Faramir
activates for 14, Gandalf takes Threat to 0. Exhaust Elrond/Vilya to
acquire Stand and Fight, play Snowbourn Scout to put 1 progress on
Second Hall. Stage 2 cleared. Durin's Bane attacks, Snowbourn Scout
defends, shadow Great Cave Troll for no effect.</li>
  <li>Travel: Dark Pit, let's go for it.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 1.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-6">Round 6</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 17, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry The Mountain's Roots. Stargazer scry Unexpected
Courage. Play Gandalf, draw Unexpected Courage, Henamarth, Steward
of Gondor.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, Gandalf, Faramir activates for 16, throw
Steward of Gondor to Eowyn for 17, draw The Mountain's Roots.
Net 17, need 20 to win. Next round.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Durin's Bane.</li>
  <li>Combat: Daughter defends, Counter Spell for no effect.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's not won yet, things could still go very sideways. Really
depends on the next card draws.</p>

<h4 id="round-7">Round 7</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 16, draw Vilya.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Ranging Goblin. Stargazer scry Gandalf,
activate Elrond/Vilya to bring in Gandalf, threat 0.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Gandalf, activate Faramir and
pitch Vilya to Eowyn for 13 Will. Draw Ranging
Goblin. Damage on Theodred. Need 15, so will be going another
round.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 1. Ranging Goblin shuffles back in.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a slight retro as I blundered with putting UC on Faramir
forgetting (conveniently) that Unexpected Courage only goes
on heroes. Oops. I should have put Unexpected Courage on Elrond
which would have given me the win in this round.</p>

<h4 id="round-8">Round 8</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 18, draw Light of Valinor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Scry Second Deep. Stargazer Scry Snowbourn Scout,
we're good now. Play Light of Valinor and Unexpected Courage on Elrond. Exhaust
Elrond/Vilya to play Snowbourn Scout, clear Second Hall.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, Theodred, Snowbourn Scout, activate
Faramir and pitch Hasty Stroke to Eowyn for 13 Will, draw
Second Deep for 8, and that's a win.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I made a big blunder not putting Unexpected Courage on Elrond
in Round 7, it would have been a win. Also, had I been a little more
observant, I might have been able to get through Stage 1 on 2 rounds
instead of 3 rounds. I could see this quest playing out in 5 rounds
with a bit of luck on the card draw.</p>

<p>Another blunder: When moving to Stage 2, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FscCaBXgM4">apparently I could have put
4 progress on the quest
immediately</a>, which seems
pretty wack to me.</p>

<p>Also, Stargazer is not unique, and I could have brought a second
one in to chump.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
