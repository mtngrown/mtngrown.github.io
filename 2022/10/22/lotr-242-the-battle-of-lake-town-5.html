</ul>
<p><em>The Battle of Lake-Town</em> remains one of the tougher quests in
the entire game, even after 11 years. Playing progression style
let's me relive what the original players experienced.</p>

<p>From previous losses, some lessons learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don't give up too soon. Just because it's hard doesn't
mean it can't be won.</li>
  <li>Exploit Elrond's ability to pay for any sphere allies.</li>
  <li>Use Hasty Stroke when faced with an immediate loss.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Light of Valinor</li>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Light of Valinor</li>
  <li>Gleowine</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
</ol>

<p>Encounter: Great House, which is 6 Threat and resolves Burn Damage.
By the Grim Rule, I'm going to count it's Burn value of 3 as well.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<p>Because I have A Test of Will in hand, I'm going to keep the
Spirit resource available for spending.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Planning: Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Elrond for 8 Will. Draw Smaug the Mighty.
Draw South Pier for 14 total, net +6 Threat, toss the extra Light of
Valinor to Eowyn for +5 for Threat 35.</li>
  <li>Travel: South Pier.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: none.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 36.</li>
</ol>

<p>Survived Round 1, not bad. Can I survive Round 2?</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Vilya.</li>
  <li>Planning: play Vilya, Light of Valinor on Elrond. Play Gleowine
and draw Stand and Fight. Play Snowbourn Scout. This leaves me with
one resource for A Test of Will if necessary.</li>
  <li>Quest: Elrond, Eowyn, Theodred for 8. Engage Smaug the Terrible
defending with Snowbourn Scout with 5 Burn damage, shadow <em>Scorching Blast</em>
to add 5 more Burn. Draw Scorching Blast for 5 more Burn, could
cancel but I think I have room for it. Net +2 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Smaug.</li>
  <li>Combat: Snowbourn Scout defends, shadow Esgaroth Wharf for +2 and an additional attack.
Let's exhaust Elrond/Vilya and what turns up: Sneak Attack, which I'd
like to use with Gandalf as a defender but I don't have any Leadership
resources. I do have a Stand and Fight, I'll bring back a Snowbourn
Scout. This would otherwise be a loss. Shadow North Pier for no effect.
Snowbourn's progress goes on South Pier which clears it.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 37.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<p>This is as far as I've gotten on this quest so far.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Gleowine.</li>
  <li>Planning: Gleowine draws Snowbourn Scout, which goes into
play.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Theodred, Elrond for 8 Will. Engage Smaug the
Magnifent, Snowbourn Scout defends, excess damage is 7 hits to
Lake-Town. Draw Close to the Flame which deals one hit to
each character in play. Net +2 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: Great House.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Smaug.</li>
  <li>Combat: Stand and Fight to bring in Snowbourn Scout,
shadow Esgaroth Wharf for +1 and an additional attack
after adding +6 Burn to Lake Town.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's the game.</p>

<p>Whoops, let's see what Elrond turns up: A Test of Will which
is not useful, bottom of deck with it.</p>

<p>Basically, I need to be able to chump 3 allies per turn
to keep Smaug out of staging.</p>

<p>For this game, having Great House as the initial reveal really
hurt, 6 Threat is really a lot given Smaug's high threat.</p>

<p>Given my goal was to simply get through the first round,
I'm pretty happy how this game turned out.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
