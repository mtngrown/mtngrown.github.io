<p>Another successful Game Day with my usual collaborator for Lord of the
Rings card game progression play through. <em>To Catch An Orc</em> stymied us
on our previous session, so after a deck rebuild from mono Leadership to
a Leadship, Lore, Spirit deck, we try again.</p>

<h3 id="game-245">Game 245</h3>

<p>This was a first turn scoop with two Orc Skirmishers appearing.
Not an auspicious beginning. I was inclined to swap my deck out
completely, but we decided to continue on, this time ensuring we quested
successfully no matter what.</p>

<h3 id="game-246">Game 246</h3>

<p>This game started out better than any of the three previous games, first
turn successful questing is really important, and there could be a lot
threat coming out. However, we got through the first turn pretty well,
then ended up treading water for  long, long time.</p>

<p>This went really, really long, 12-15 rounds. We cycled the Encounter
deck twice, and both ran out of cards. The orc Mugash turned out to be
2d from bottom of JL's out of play deck, it took a really long time to
find it, then we ended up in location lock, where the "Deal One Damage
to Each Exhausted Character" treachery cleared the board. Brutal.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
