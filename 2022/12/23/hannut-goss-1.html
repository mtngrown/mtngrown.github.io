Hannut - GOSS 1
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 23 2022</time>
<p>Finally, time to get my first Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS)
game on the table. This game started Dec. 23, 2022, with the playthrough
posted at the end of the game.</p>

<p>Hannut is a "GOSS-Lite" having arrived as part of World At War
magazine #80. The full GOSS rules (2020 edition) are around 80 pages.
Hannut rules are 16 pages.</p>

<p>Since I sorted all the counters by unit when I clipped the corners, set
up was easy. Even easier as I have no idea what I'm doing, so I just
spread the counters on the map and will see how the game plays out.
It's going to be pretty ugly but that's ok.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<h3 id="command-phase-am-gt-only">Command Phase (AM GT only)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The supply status of all their HQs and units.
I'm going to assume everything is in supply at the start of the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The night activity markers they will place in the Night GT Box for that GD.
None for the first turn, make it easy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The movement status for their sideâ€™s HQs.
Mobile for both HQ.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The receipt of air points (AP).
Added markers to track on the map.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The receipt and assignment of barrage points (BP) to HQs.
Barrage points:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>4th Pz: 9 + 0 Corps BP</li>
      <li>2d DM: 7 + 2 Corps BP</li>
      <li>3d DM: 7 + 5 Corps BP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="german-player-turn">German Player Turn</h3>

<h4 id="active-player-movement-phase">Active Player Movement Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) (French phasing player only) The French player may flip any IP under
construction markers so that their IP completed side shows.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) The active player may place or remove the below markers on any
eligible friendly units. If a unit is marked with an Exp, CR, or IP
under construction marker, that unit cannot move during this Movement
Phase.</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Exploitation (Exp)</li>
  <li>Prepared Assault (PA): Units marked with PA marker may move.</li>
  <li>Combat Reserve (CR)</li>
  <li>Improved position (IP): Under Construction (French only)</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) Place reinforcements due to arrive during the GT. They may move in
Step 3.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">4) Move eligible active units in any order.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">(<strong>Special German Exploitation Phase</strong>): The German player may move any friendly units
marked with an Exp marker up to one-half of their movement allowance.
They may conduct overrun combat (13.13).</p>

<p>Here's what we have after the Germans make their move:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/goss/hannut/g1-t1-german-movement.jpg" alt="End of Turn 1 German
movement" /></p>

<h4 id="active-player-combat-phase">Active Player Combat Phase:</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) The active player places tactical assault (TA) markers on top of
friendly units that will attack without using PA.</p>

<p>Added 3 to the Germans.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">2) The active player conducts Air FS missions.</p>

<p>Germans will not commit any Air this attack.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">3) The non-active player
conducts artillery, then Air FS missions.</p>

<p>The French do not respond this attack.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">4) The active player conducts artillery FS missions.</p>

<p>Not this turn.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">5) The active player may remove attack markers (both TA and PA) as
necessary or desired.</p>

<p>Keeping all of them on since no fire support (FS) missions conducted.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">6) The active player conducts all TA and
PA ground assaults. After completion of all GAs, remove all AS markers.</p>

<p>And off we go.</p>

<h5 id="ground-assault-ga-1">Ground Assault (GA) 1</h5>

<p>Many hours of reading rules for both Hannut and the full GOSS rules set.
I'm going to end up printing out some player aids for sure.</p>

<p>The following combat rounds are <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_AY-GlG1ByEy-Nl2wEVNYrL0UxxpYGNoOf9FLEf33Zo/edit#gid=0">tracked on a Google
Sheet</a>.
An Excel file can be made available.</p>

<p><strong>Combat 1</strong>: 5707 to 5607, result is German retreat, the way I read the
rules is that I need to make a maximum retreat unless making and
passing a proficiency check. Since this is a mech stack, retreat 1
hexes as there is only 1 discretionary hit.</p>

<p><strong>Combat 2</strong>: 5705 to 5605, result is attacker with 1 discretionary hit,
defender takes 2 discretionary hits. The German attacker passes a PRC
and takes a step loss on the lead unit 1./7 Auf. The defender chooses
to make PRC and fails with a valid retreat path. Since the artillery
unit isn't even supposed to be in this game with these rules, going
to eliminate it.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/goss/hannut/g1-t1-c2.jpg" alt="Second combat" /></p>

<p><strong>Combat 3</strong>: 5703 to 5604, the result is a German <code>1(2)</code>, which is
terrible for the Germans, but no big deal, learning games are usually
laughably bad. Since the II/35 was the lead unit, it will take the step
loss, the German PRC passed so the stack retreats to 5903. The French
got a <code>*</code> result and passed PRC yielding no effect.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/goss/hannut/g1-t1-c3.jpg" alt="Second combat" /></p>

<p>And that's enough for this weekend. The game is moved to the back room
where I'll play it out over the next couple of months.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
