End of year wrapup with small games
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Dec 26 2022</time>
<p>My usual hex and counter opponent stopped by. I wasn't really feeling up
to a big, heavy game for which we would only finish a turn or two, so
small games went on the table.</p>

<p><strong>Absolutely Aces</strong>, two games:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dave 18, Al 9: introductory game to learn the rules.</li>
  <li>Dave 18, Al 0. This second game may have been more luck than not.</li>
</ol>

<p>One thing I got out of this is sometimes it's good to hold the Joker
back. It is a risk, but the opportunity is getting it into the other
person's hand, where it might get stuck.</p>

<p><strong>Star Realms Colony Wars</strong> first game in ages. I managed to win this
with a Bot strategy, grinding down his authority slowly while thinning
my hand. I didn't have much of a resource engine, so it would have been
a losing strategy had the game gone more than a couple more turns.</p>

<p><strong>A Study In Emerald</strong> for either my 5th or 6th play, depending on
whether I actually played it last year. I recall playing it for at least
a couple of games last year but nobody else recalls it. Very strange. In
any case, we played a short-ish game and declared a tie, but it was
looking like I was on track for losing. Good game, would like to play it
a lot more often.</p>

<p><strong>Zombie Dice</strong>, a couple of plays first time in a long time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Amazingly, I wan this 13 to 7. I usually lose at this game.</li>
  <li>Even more amazingly, I won twice in a row, which I can't recall ever
doing before, 16 to 12.</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all a pretty good day with 6 games played. No new games, but
that's ok. Plenty of unplayed games aren't going anywhere.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
