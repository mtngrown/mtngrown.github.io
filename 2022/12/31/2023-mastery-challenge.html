<p>2022 went by in a bit of a blur. I managed to get in some decent game
play, although not much mastery play. Work consumed the majority of
my intellectual effort. Again.</p>

<p>Work will be an overriding concern 2023, and trump game time to at least the
extent of 2022, and possibly more. 2022 is the one of very few years on record
where stocks and bonds moved down together. This has happened once or twice in
the last 100 years, and that's with an economy which isn't in a recession. As
retirement approaches, I'm gainfully employed and mean to stay that way at
least until the market is a bit more stable.</p>

<p>For 2023, if I have any goal at all, getting to H-index 16 seems like
an attainable goal. If I get serious about it I'll create an epic on my
personal Jira account and ticket up the plays. Which I just did.</p>

<p>Here are another few aspirations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Work through the Heirs of Numenor, Against the Shadow cycle in Lord of
the Rings LCG, I've been stuck on Battle of Lake Town, which is a really,
really hard quest. It has me stalled out. It might be worth bailing out
on this for now, and revisiting it later. <strong>The Battle of Lake Town defeated
<a href="/2023/06/17/lotr-258-the-battle-of-lake-town-9.html">June 17, 2023</a></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Raise my play count to 5 for either Winter War or Year of the Rat.
I'm leaning towards Year of the Rat for this one, but Winter war is
a close second. These are both very early and very good wargames which have
stood the test of time well. Getting Phantom Leader to 10 plays is another
good goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn some new games. Specifically, I have Hannut on the table right
now as a learning game for the GOSS system. I'm intending on diving
pretty deep into the game. It's 15 turns, and while I'll be surprised
if I take to conclusion, I should be able to play out 5 or 6 turns.
My usual wargame opponent really enjoys playing new games, and he has
<a href="/2023/04/30/cataphract-1-the-catalaunian-fields.html">Cataphract</a>,
MBT, and <a href="/2023/06/18/next-war-taiwan-1.html">Next War: Taiwan</a> more
or less in queue. I should also play through one of the HFD Vietnam
games. We'll see how it plays out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something exotic, such as Chad The Toyota Wars, Liberia, or The Chaco War.
Not sure which one, but I really ought to pick one of these and play it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue work on Viet Nam, or Dien Bien Phu rebuilds. I also have four
other vintage, 1970's games in PDF form only which I would also like
to rebuild.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We'll see how it plays out. As usual, work is liable to trump any plans
I make. That's just how it goes.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<p>From time to time over the course of the year I'm liable to post updates
of how the year has been going to date. These are informal and unscheduled,
and on no particuler cadence.</p>

<h3 id="november-25">November 25</h3>

<p>Probably a little late for this update as it's getting close to the end
of the year. Upshot so far is I'm a little behind where I'd like to be
with LotR, and didn't get as many High Frontier games in as I'd have
liked. For High Frontier, I had originally planned on getting several
plays in with Contracts and M4 module which was scheduled for Q3 of
this year, but has been pushed back to Q2 of next year (which probably
means even later, but whatever).</p>

<p>Aspirationally, I might just get through Heirs of Numenor by the end of the
year. I have a few plays of Blood of Gondor, and would only lack Siege
of Cair Andros to polish it off.</p>

<h3 id="august-27">August 27</h3>

<p>Game 16 of Starforce brings H-index to 16.</p>

<h3 id="june-22">June 22</h3>

<p>I'm more than half way through a week of PTO, and have been able to play some
games during this time. I finally beat The Battle of Lake Town, then followed
up with a win against Peril in Pelargir, so I'm back on track with LotR. Doubtful
I'll finish the whole cycle this year, but I will make progress. I'm two plays
closer to H-index 16, and have some new games played including Cataphract, Next
War: India-Pakistan, and Next War: Taiwan. Work has eased off a bit, but I've
also put a fair amount of Saturday energy into plants and chore. So far, I've
been able to get in at least 1 game per month.</p>

<h3 id="march-31">March 31</h3>

<p>It's been a very busy Q1 for me. I've worked one or both days almost every
weekend. I know that common knowledge is working weekends leads to burnout
and inefficiency over time, and perhaps that's true, but the sitation at
work demanded a deadline, so no time to be burnt out. The economy is going
to crap right now, and AI is coming on strong. I suspect what programming 
looked like last year will never look like that again. With the AI wave
looming, I need to retrain more than I need to play games. Hence, work as
much as I'm able, picking up new skills best I can.</p>

<p>My new target is playing at least one game per month. I'm going to leave my
aspirations posted and we'll see how the year plays out.</p>

<p>There is a bright spot: I've been slowly getting the Nguyen Hue rules
transcibed. The rules scan is really not very good, so it's much
more tedious than Game Science Viet Nam was. I'm about half through
the main text body of the rules. Game Science Viet Nam is also moving
forward, but I have not put any serious work into Dien Bien Phu. The
rules formatting for that will be much more difficult than any of
the other games so far.</p>

<p>Here are the mastery challenges from previous years:</p>

  <li><a href="/2015/12/31/2016-challenge.html">2016 Mastery Challenge</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is getting to be quite a collection.</p>

<h2 id="h-index-and-plays">H-index and plays</h2>

<p><strong>2023-12-31</strong>: Current average plays for count of owned games: <code>1316 / 130 = 10.00</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>304/248</code> <strong>Lord of the Rings LCG</strong> I average about 50 plays
per year to date, so I expect that's about what I'll get in
for 2023.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>115/110</code> <strong>Absolutely Aces</strong> will likely get a few intermittent
plays. I have introduced the game to a few people, but I always win
which makes it no fun for them probably. And it's fast and fun to
play solitaire as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>71/11</code> <strong>Jump Drive</strong> I believe will be a perennial climber.
I figured out a decent solitaire mode for it which will play
very quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>64/64</code> <strong>Hive</strong> not anticipating serious play this year.
This game is too addictive, interferes with work as I only
play it online.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>55/51</code> <strong>High Frontier 4 All</strong> I intend on at least a
half dozen games this year, maybe more if Module 4 ships.
This is also very addictive, but the play time is long
enough that I don't ever have it out when I'm at work,
and I won't play it online. I'd like to get 2-3 Futures
games in as well. Those generally eat a whole weekend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>44/44</code> <strong>Ogre</strong> no plans for Ogre this year, but we'll
see what happens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>35/35</code> <strong>Zombie Dice</strong> might be going back into rotation,
my usual opponent and I have missed it. We used to knock out
a game or two at the end of a Game Day, and got out of the
habit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>PanzerBlitz</strong> no plans for PanzerBlitz this
year, but who knows?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>Star Realms</strong> going back into rotation for
2023.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>22/22</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong> saw plays in 2022, and is likely to
see some plays in 2023. I'd like to continue on my theorycrafting
on Scenarios 6a and 6b, and there is still the full campaign to play.
My usual opponent and I have played almost every other scenario.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>21/21</code> <strong>Race for the Galaxy</strong> no plans for 2023, this is
another which I typically play on line, hence, don't want the
distraction right now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20/18</code> <strong>6 Nimmt!</strong> is out of my collection at the moment as
I left it in Ft. Wayne. I might get some plays there, so I'm leaving
it in the list for now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20/20</code> <strong>Ogre: Objective 218</strong> will likely see some solitaire
action. From the last few solo games, I'm thinking there are
more combos to find. Sometimes it's hard to figure there out
playing solitaire, playing opposed provides exposure to different
playing styles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>19/19</code> <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> will almost surely find some play time
with the new Fall of Saigon scenario.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>16/15</code> <strong>Battle for Moscow</strong> is on my list for getting to H-index 16,
the Jira ticket is already written.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>16/14</code> <a href="/tags/starforce.html">StarForce</a> is on the
list for 2023 H-index 16. Jira tickets have already been created. It's
almost surely coming off the H-index after the 16-th play. I like the
game, a lot, but not enough to commit to pursuing mastery at this time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/13</code> <strong>Vietnam 1965-1975</strong> will likely climb in the rankings. I'd
like to do some theorycrafting on the Starlite scenario, and some solo
plays of the Silver Bayonet scenario.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/13</code> <strong>Vietnam Solitaire</strong> is on my list for H-index 16. Jira tickets
have already been created.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/7</code> <strong>GBOH</strong> will almost surely get a game or two in, possibly
Cataphract or Caesar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Hapsburg Eclipse</strong> not anticipating plays this year, considering
selling it anyway.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Objective Kiev</strong> no plays this year, but will be back in rotation
in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Pandemic</strong> might play in Ft. Wayne.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Soviet Dawn</strong> no plays anticipated, but will be the next States
of Siege game I play, and likely the only one I'm inclined to keep.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Target Leningrad</strong> probably not in 2023, but will definitely
be back on the table in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>Leaving Earth</strong> I'd like to get one play in 2023. Even
just the base game would be fine. It consumes pretty much an entire
weekend of intellectual activity, not a game I can solitaire lightly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>Flash Point</strong> no plans for 2023.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10/10</code> <strong>OCS</strong> aspirational for 2023, given a goal of
getting H-index to 16. Perhaps after that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong> an aspirational entry, would like to
play this more often.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>Pax Porfiriana</strong> has its first appearance on this list in 2023.
No plans to play this year, but I really enjoy playing this online at
yucata,de, and I do anticipate playing a lot more of it in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>5/5</code> <strong>Phantom Leader</strong> has not appeared on this list until this
year, which is an oversight. The game plays quickly, and lends itself
to campaign play. No specific plans for 2023, but it will be a fast
climber once it gets back on the table.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>3/3</code> <strong>High Frontier 3rd Edition</strong> Might take it back out
for a spin, it would be interesting to see how the rules differ
from HF4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>1/1</code> <strong>Other COIN</strong> Unlikely to play, based on last several years
experience, but I'm leaving it here as a reminder.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wargame-specific-h-index">Wargame-specific H-index</h3>

<p>My wargame-specific H-index started 2019 at 10. Wargames are so much
more time consuming that this index will increase much, much more slowly
than the overall H-index. I do not expect much progress on this list
in 2023.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>44</code> Ogre</li>
  <li><code>27</code> PanzerBlitz</li>
  <li><code>22</code> Silver Bayonet</li>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
