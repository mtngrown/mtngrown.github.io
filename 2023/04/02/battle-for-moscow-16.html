<p><strong>Update 2023-04-03</strong> The Germans do not get a Special Movement
phase during Turn 1. This really matters a lot, and it's why
this game went so poorly for the Soviets.</p>

<p>Back to the old classic, which is also on my H-index list to get
me to 16. I have it set up on the table, first time in several
years.</p>

<p>Turn 1 massive breakthrough, and at the end of Turn 2 I have the
panzers cutting off Soviet supply/communications. So they can't
acquire replacements. Just in time for mud turn. Also, this was
a punch right through the middle. But the Soviets were able to
get the southern edge open. Let's see if they can hold it.</p>

<p>Calling it at Turn 6. I may have misplayed something as that
was too easy as the Germans. Game went less then 2 hours. Reading
through previous games, I've done these around an hour or so,
90 minutes counting write and posting, etc.</p>

<p>Here's what it looked like, total carnage.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
