Cataphract 1 - The Catalaunian Fields
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Apr 30 2023</time>
<p><em>Cataphract</em> is another GBoH title, for which this was our first play. It's not
clear how much difference between this and Alexander and SPQR
there is, but having played those games, it was not difficult to
get going in this one. We chose Catalaunian Fields for our first
play, feeling we had enough experience with GBoH to manage the
number and variety of forces brought to battle.</p>

<p>I played the Romans, which set up on the west side, with the
Huns to the east. North is to the left. Here's what the setup
looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/cataphract/catalaunian-fields/g1_setup.jpg" alt="Catalaunian Fields setup" /></p>

<p>We went five or six rounds, with my Romans pushing back hard on the Huns, but
the Huns making a number of spectacular rallies. They were really favored by
the dice this game in that respect.</p>

<p>Contrary to my normal more cautious play, with this game I spent just a turn
or two getting forces positioned, than went straight into it, charging the
Huns line head on.</p>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Huns: 31 RP withdraw.</li>
  <li>Romans: Theodoric II killed, 25 RP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what it looked like at the end of Turn 5 (or so) when
we wrapped it up:</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Notable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Shock combat differs only in one places, which is a
step after the shock resolution. Alexander puts an extra step
here which is not present in Cataphract.</li>
  <li>Don't let leaders get killed!  I mmanages to get Theodoric II killed.
From Section 12.11, eliminated leaders are worth 5x their initiative in RP.</li>
  <li>Rally rolls can be game changers! The Huns managed to rally at
least 25 RP, which is a really big deal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the situation where we called the game for time:</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
