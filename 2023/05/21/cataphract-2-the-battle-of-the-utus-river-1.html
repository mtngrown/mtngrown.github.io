<p>Another game of Cataphract, again with Attila, this time against
the eastern Romans.</p>

<p>There were a lot of counters on the map, perhaps not as many as
at Hydaspes, but still a lot.</p>

<p>Up is north.</p>

<p>Atila, to the east, is about to go mano a mano with the Romans. How will it go?
Attila's light cavalry is reknown, and he's bringing a heftly contingent of
heavy cav.  The Romans are bringing cataphracts.</p>

<p>How will it play out?</p>

<p>Maybe not so well for Attila. While in the north, his forces managed to slow
down and heavily damage the Roman cataphracts, down south, the Roman heavy cav
is executing a picture perfect wheel, is almost completely undamaged, and is
positioning well to charge up the rear of Attila's light cav. Which is being
kept very busy by Roman heavy infantry.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/cataphract/the-battle-of-the-utus-river/g2-end.jpg" alt="Turn 3 and game end" /></p>

<p>Further south, that purple line (more Roman heavy infantry) has yet to engage,
and will form the anvil to the hammer of Roman cataphracts who will come in
from the east.</p>

<p>As can be seen, a fair number of Huns have already figured this out and are
rapidly exiting (Routing) east to safety. Bad day at the RIver Utus.</p>

<p>Great Battles of History!</p>

<p>Final rout points at Game end:</p>

  <li>Al: 24,,</li>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
