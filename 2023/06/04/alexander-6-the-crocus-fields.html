<p>Back to the Macedonians, with Philip II going at the Phocians.
Philip II (Alex's dad), The Champion of Apollo,
was bent on giving the sacrilegious Phocians a punch in the snoot
after those bastards defiled the temple at Delphi and carted off
all the loot. This battle is part of what is apparently called
"The Sacred War," pitting multiple Greek states against each
other.</p>

<p>Here's the setup at the start of the game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/alexander/crocus-fields/g6-start.jpg" alt="Crocus Fields start" /></p>

<p>For this game, I attempted to dictate game play using iPhone notes.
It did not go as well as I had hoped, in part because the dictation
software seems to operate at about a 5th grade level. It was unable
to correctly transcribe enunciated names, and would correct the names
to ridiculous character strings.</p>

<p>Here's part of the first turn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>phocian Lycophron OK I would also be at your work for which puts me in a yeah
you can go next overlay or OK you don’t go next dragon eye I have a four so I
just went so you can go OK with initiative, three kicks off by moving to the
LM mercenarys to the northwest and following him roll nine for momentum
reroll is five on momentum so he’s finished.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Macedonian Antipater moves west to activate Sitalces, who issues individual
orders to Calvary, which moves to engage the previously move Phocians in
shock combat.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>All units past troop, quality, check.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>All right, let’s see Ellen so I’ll see is attacking to OK so there’s no
there’s no shock superiority and then we go to our class is spears LC 2LN is
column 7.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>size ratio is eight on attack 10 on defense. no column shift for the
attacker. I shock results are three and two and two and two.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antipater rolls for momentum and fails.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sitalces advances his skirmishers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phocian Neeses issues like him out to move all the skirmishers rose momentum
passes momentum like him out to move up all the medium infantry and he’s
finished. I have a five piece finished.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is for Parmenoion OK I’m gonna issue a command activate and then I’m
going to move all these guys forward. OK OK so he has arranged in definitely
move. 12345 OK 12345 OK and who is this guy was a palm Armenian OK. Also
activate Attalus who will move three units.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parmenian gets momentum,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>oh no marches (Onomarchus) issues individual orders to move Greek mercenary
hoplites into shock combat Raz momentum issues individual orders to move
Argus hoplites into shock come back with my Pastis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I attempted to correct it as we went, but it was time consuming and broke
the flow of the game so I gave up half way through Turn 1. I think there
is some potential here, but it's going to take serious work to figure it out.</p>

<p>Here's the end of Turn 1, followed by Turns 2 &amp; 3.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/alexander/crocus-fields/g6-t1.jpg" alt="Crocus Fields start" /></p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/alexander/crocus-fields/g6-t2.jpg" alt="Crocus Fields start" /></p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The Macedonions are just really, really strong in this game, with both Phalanx
units and average higher troop quality. The Phocians really have to do a lot more
manuevering to try to get position on the Macedonians, which is tough. The Greeks,
my side, had more skirmishers, but I did not employ them well. In future games,
both of us agreed to work more on effectively deploying skirmishers.</p>

<p>This game would go to Al playing the Philip II, the Macedonians. His forces
were closer to my retreat edge, and had less cohesion hits overall due to my
super crappy dice rolling. With his better troop quality, attrition would
rout the Greeks first. And since his forces were closer to my edge of the map,
his forces had a longer retreat route.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
