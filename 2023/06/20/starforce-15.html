StarForce 15 - The Colonization War (1)
</h1>
<time class='updated' pubdate=''>Jun 20 2023</time>
<p><strong>Update: 2023-08-27</strong>: I don't believe I played combat correctly.
There should have been more CBR losses than I recorded.</p>

<p>From contributor John Garrett, a solitaire scenario:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel that the major drawback of the Starforce game is that there is only
the one solitaire scenario (Rescue Mission 38.0) even though the basic game
utilises a simple CRT. Therefore, the following scenario came into being.
(42.0) The colonisation war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the accompanying rules.</p>

<h3 id="the-colonization-war">(42.0) The Colonization War</h3>

<h4 id="introduction">(42.1) Introduction</h4>

<p>In 2227. before the advent of the Solar Hemogeny and the
L'Chal-dah, Rare starships had explored and colonised many of the surrounding
star systems. However, there was a great deal of dissent against the
home-orientated government (C.B.R.) and in 2229, incensed by the high level of
taxation on mineral exploration, a committee of a new colonial rights council
(C.R.C.) was established on HR 7703. Terrified at the unity this group had
achieved, the C.B.R. asked for a delegation to be sent to discuss terms. The
C.R.C. however unwittingly sent all their major leaders to the conference in a
single starship as an act of good faith and the perfidious C.B.R. destroved the
ship and taking advantage of the C.R.C.'s mornentary disunity, attacked at once
and in a short campaign ruthlessiv subdued the revolt.  However, the loss of so
many telesthenics was a severe setback to colonisation plans, the government
itself being overthrown in the people's war the following year.</p>

<p>Explanation For everv starforce a chit is drawn individually and is cross
referenced on the table with its starting point to find the I.D, code of its
new position. The chit is then replaced and another one drawn for the next
starforce. If the stargate at the point of destination has been neutralised the
starforce stays put.</p>

<h4 id="rationale">(42.6) Rationale</h4>

<p>This game was devised to be played quickly and simply yet still provide a
challenge to a more experienced player. It is also intended to present a
position not unlike standard 2-D with a few diversified strategies.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here's the setup:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/starforce/g15-setup.jpg" alt="StarForce Colonization War setup" /></p>

<p>The player takes the role of the CBR faction, shown as the green counters,
and moves first. They need to neutralize all the CRC stargates in 6 turns.
Given the distance, I think this might be difficult.</p>

<p>The CRC is shown with yellow counters with the chart above governing
the movement of the CRC.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>Moved everything, but it's hard to keep track of which starforces
moved where, and which systems are called what. Had to take some time
to figure out how to log it, and made some map markers.</p>

<p>Combat will be at Locations 2 and E.</p>

<p>Location 2: This is a bare stargate with strength 5 after the first round.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Round 2: SG defend 3, attack 2, CRC B attack 3, defend 0. SG roll 2
for elimination of B, who cannot damage SG as it needs a result of 2
to be neutralized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Location E: There are 4 CRC units and 1 CBR.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First round: CBR defend 5, attack 3; CRC attack 2, defend 0.
CBR roll eliminates D automatically, CRC roll 0 for no effect.</li>
  <li>Second round: CBR 8 defense, 4 attack; CRC SG 5 attack 0 defense.
CRC roll 4 for no effect, CBR roll 7 for 3 which neutralizes Stargate
at Location E.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it for Turn 1.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Moves are much smoother this turn. Combat at Locations 2, 4, and E.</p>

<p>Location 2: With the Stargate, there is no first round combat.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Round 2: SG defend 3, attack 2; starforce F attack 3 defend 0.
No effect from CRC attack, CBR roll 3 to eliminate F.</li>
</ul>

<p>Location 4: defending starforce present.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Round 1: CBR attack 0, defend 2; CRC attack 2, defend 0.
CBR roll 0 for no effect, CRC roll 7 to eliminate Z.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Round 2: SG defend 3, attack 2; CRC unit C attack 3 defend 0.
CRC roll for no effect. CBR roll 2 elininate unit C.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Location C: There is a defender and a stargate.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Round 1: CBR defend 3, attack 3; CRC attack 3, defend 0.
CBR roll 0 eliminate J. CRC roll 5 for no effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Round 2: CBR defend 8, attack 4; stargate attack 5, defend 0.
CBR roll 3 to eliminate stargate, CRC roll 5 for no effect.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Two stargates down, three to go. I think it's going to require
overshifting to get to the remaining.</p>

<p>Let's try another turn.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>I've been Doing It Wrong. It costs 4 movement to enter a hostile
stargate, which means overshifting, or stopping right next to it
then shifting in next turn. Will continue the play doing it correctly
from here out.</p>

<p>There is only combat at Location 2, with only a stargate there.</p>

<p>Location 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Round 2: Defend 3, attack 2; CRC H attack 3, defend 0. CBR roll 2
which eliminates.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's Turn 3. Onward.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>I'll be lucky if I can get my starforces close enough for next
turn, otherwise it will come down to the last turn.</p>

<p>Location 1: CRC ships A and K defended by CRB Y.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Round 1: CRB attack 2, defened 0; CRC attack 4, defend 0.
CBR roll 8 eliminates both A and K, CRC roll 9 eliminates Y.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is interesting, as there is a chance of getting 2 more CRC
ships at 1, which would be very bad news for the stargate there.</p>

<p>But that's the turn. Onward.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>I could still lose this game.</p>

<p>Location D: 2 CBR take on a stargate, and probably lose.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Round 1: stargate defend 5, attack 0; CBR attack 6, defend 0.
CBR roll 8, stargate eliminated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's crank it out.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>Location A: no enemy starforces, proceed to round 2.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Round 2: Stargate defend 5, attack 0; CBR attack 6, defend 0.
CBR roll 2, no effect. This continues until rolling 7, 8. 9, which
took two more rolls.</li>
</ul>

<p>Location B:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Round 2: stargate defend 5, attack 0; CBR attack 9, defend 0.
This is an auto kill.</li>
</ul>

<p>A notional win, but I played movement wrong. This was interesting
enough to play again, at least one more time.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Here is a conundrum. Suppose I have two starforces who shift into
an lz with only a hostile stargate. Combat will ensure, starting "round 2."
Suppose the stargate declares defense 5 and attack 0, and my starforces
declare attack 6 and defense 0.</p>

<p>On the face of it, no problem.</p>

<p>However, the CRT states "Attacking Strength Points less Defending Strength Points."</p>

<p>0 - 0 = 0.</p>

<p>Examining the 0 column, the stargate can whittle down the attackers.</p>

<p>I'm probably missing something in the rules, but I don't see it, and it's
odd and entertaining enough I thought I'd toss it out to see what anyone
might think.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2023-08-27</strong>: See <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3103888/crt-0-column-conundrum">the discussion here</a>,
and Case 8.53 in the rules.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
