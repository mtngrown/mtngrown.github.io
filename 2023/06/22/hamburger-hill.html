<h2 id="day-turn-1">Day Turn 1</h2>

<h4 id="i-replacements--reinforcements-phase-1">I. Replacements &amp; Reinforcements Phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Both sides receive replacements and rein-forcements. See 12.0. The NVA Player

<p class="turn-sequence">The US Player rolls and die and refers to the Random Events Chart to determine
what random event will take place that day.</p>

<p>Not end of day.</p>

<p><strong>B. US Player Turn</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Artillery / Air Preparatory Bombardments ("Prep Fires") Phase</li>
  <li>Movement Phase
    <ul>
      <li>Check for mines in bunker hexes</li>
      <li>NVA Player commits his snipers to slow movement</li>
      <li>NVA units conduct defensive fire or retreat on contact</li>
      <li>Resolve NVA static situations (8.8)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Combat Phase
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct Artillery / Air Fire Support.
Resolve effects on NVA targets and adjacent U.S. units</li>
      <li>Conduct offensive fire against adjacent NVA units</li>
      <li>Roll for pin removal from all units</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Prep fire: Put 7 Support on the NVA on Hill 916 side. Roll 1 + 1 for 2,
<code>Pin/Casualty</code>. This is a Dummy unit!</p>

<p>All companies move adjacent to NVA bunkered units, all of whom will
conduct defensive fire:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>A/3/187</code>: roll 2 - 1 (from bunker) for <code>Pin</code>.</li>
  <li><code>B/3/187</code>: roll 6 for no effect.</li>
  <li><code>C/3/187</code>: dummy</li>
  <li><code>D/3/187</code>: dummy</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no static situation this round.</p>

<p>Not going to do Support for this round, so it's A and B companies
firing into a bunker with 15, +1 into bunker, -1 for strength
greater than 14, automatic <code>P/C</code>.</p>

<p><strong>C. NVA Player Turn</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Movement Phase
    <ul>
      <li>Resolve US artillery / air strikes against moving units</li>
      <li>US units conduct defensive fire or retreat on contact</li>
      <li>Resolve US static situations (8.8)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Combat Phase
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct offensive fire against adjacent US units</li>
      <li>Roll for pin removal from all units</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Moved some NVA towards US to try and get some casualties. US did some supporting
interdiction fire. US defensive fire was ineffective. NVA offensive fire:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>A/3187</code>: roll 2 - 1 for <code>P/C</code>.</li>
  <li><code>B/3187</code>: roll 4 - 1 for <code>P</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>US is declaring day's end.</p>

<h4 id="iv-days-end-1">IV. Day's End</h4>

<p>Check for NVA Withdrawal. The NVA player declares if his forces will stay for
another day of combat or withdraw that night to Laos. If he decides on
with-drawal, play ends immediately and victory is determined according to 14.0.
If the NVA will stay for another day, unpin all pinned units, then go on to the
Night procedures given below.</p>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>US: 2</li>
  <li>NVA: 2</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="v-night-1">V. Night</h4>

<p><strong>A. US Movement.</strong> US Player receives 10 support points. US units may return
to LZs, no limit on movement factors.</p>

<p>This will be interesting.</p>

<p>All US back to LZ.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/hamburger-hill/g1-lz-surround.jpg" alt="US at LZ" /></p>

<p><strong>B. NVA Movement and Assault.</strong> NVA Player receives 5 support points. NVA
units may move, no limit on movement factor. Conduct night attacks.</p>

<p>NVA will move 3 stacks of 3 platoons surrounding LZ. US gets defensive Support,
will put all 10 points onto middle stack, roll 2 which is a <code>P/C</code>. Now for
defensive fire with strength a lot firing from an LZ, this is a guaranteed
<code>P/C</code>, roll to determine which unit takes it: low and middle.</p>

<p>NVA offensive fire is guaranteed <code>P/C</code>, top US unit takes it.</p>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>US: 4</li>
  <li>NVA: 4</li>
</ul>

<p>Going into next turn, the US will get replacements to bring 3/187 back to 8-8 strength.
It makes sense to put reduced units "perimeter" given they can only be brought back to
8-8. This means putting a 10-10 on perimeter is a dumb move, risks losing that step
permanently for no gain.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This seems like a pretty decent little game. I'm not sure situations like the above
are game-breaking, but it should be easily remedied if so.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is how replacements are managed. Both sides just fed troops
into a meatgrinder, day after day. Seems plausible given what I've read about the
battle.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
