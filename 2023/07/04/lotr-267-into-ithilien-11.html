<p>Apparently this is one of the harder quests in the game. FFG ranks
it pretty easy. Rereading a previous set of articles where I did a
set of first round trials, here are some guidelines I came up with
to determine whether I should scoop on the first round or continue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Celador undamaged OR with 1 damage from e.g., Forest Bat and remaining criteria fulfilled AND</li>
  <li>Ithilien Road cleared OR no enemies in play with a chump on the table and a chump in hand AND</li>
  <li>No hero destroyed AND</li>
  <li>Low or no threat in the staging area AND</li>
  <li>Round 2 is viable with a chump on the table, a playable chump in hand, progress on Ithilien Road if not cleared.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are a little bit flexible depending what I also have in my hand. These are also
tuned to the deck I am playing through this quest, which doesn't have healing (and
really needs it).</p>

<h2 id="aar-from-5-plays">AAR from 5 plays</h2>

<p>I finally got a win on the 15th play, of which maybe 8 of those were solitaire
having played it collaboratively in the past. I didn't recall much of the previous
play though.</p>

<p>As noted above, the conditions for advancing are somewhat dependent on the deck.
In this case, the deck did not have healing, so it was critical to avoid getting
damaged as much as possible.</p>

<p>I finally eked out a win in 15 rounds detailed in play 15 below. This has
two known asterisks, neither of which would have been game breakers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Celador should probably have come out a round or two before he did, and</li>
  <li>I forgot to put archery damage from Southron Mercenaries a couple of turns.</li>
</ol>

<p>I had enough characters in play to deal with the archery damage, very confident
about that. Not quite as confident about Celador, but I believe I would have been
able to manage without him a couple of turns earlier, just would have been
potentially riskier.</p>

<h2 id="game-play">Game play</h2>

<p>Let's give it a go.</p>

<h3 id="game-26711">Game 267/11</h3>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dwarven Tomb</li>
  <li>Vilya</li>
  <li>Daeron's Runes</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke</li>
  <li>Dunedain Watcher</li>
  <li>Vassal of the Windlord</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Light of Valinor.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Daeron's runes drawing Imladris Stargazer and
A Test of Will, discard Dunedain Watcher. Play Light of Valinor
on Glorfindel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Celador, Elrond, Glorfindel for Will 7, reveal Morgul Spider. Scoop</li>
</ol>

<p>I played Vassal of the Windlord and not committed to the quest, I might have
a chance dealing with spider. But not clearing Ithilien Road just puts me two
steps back. Checking the shadow card, it adds 1 hit to the attack, which is
already swinging for 5. Because Ithilien Road wasn't cleared, Southron
Company would also engage.</p>

<p>I might be able to handle this with a different set of heros, this set can't
manage it.</p>

<h3 id="game-26812">Game 268/12</h3>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dori</li>
  <li>Light of Valinor</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>Light of Valinor</li>
  <li>VAssal of the Windlord</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Imladris Stargazer</li>
  <li>Planning: Light of Valinor on Glorfindel, play Vassal of the Windlord.</li>
  <li>Quest: Celador, Vassal of the Windlord, Glorfindel, Elrond for 11 Will, reveal 
Watcher in the Woods, Threat 30, surge Morgul Spider. Ithilien Road is cleared.</li>
</ol>

<p>Morgul Spider will be swinging for 6, which kills a hero, scoop.</p>

<p>I need to have a chump out on the first round. In this case Vassal of the Windlord
would have been the key to surviving it. The spider would have survived the round,
but would not have gotten the attack bonus on the second round.</p>

<p><strong>BIG MISTAKE: I should have canceled that treachery with A Test of Will!</strong></p>

<h3 id="game-26913">Game 269/13</h3>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
  <li>Daeron's Runes</li>
  <li>Arwen Undomiel</li>
  <li>Faramir</li>
  <li>Elrond's Counsel</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-1-2">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: Daeron's Runes drawing Gandalf and
Light of Valinor, discard Faramir. Light of Valinor
on Glorfindel.</li>
  <li>Quest: Celador, Elrond, Glorfindel for 7 Will, reveal Lost Companion
and play A Test of Will to cancel. Otherwise Ithilien Road won't clear
and we'll have to engage Southron Company.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dunhere puts 2 hits on Southron Company.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 27.</li>
</ol>

<p>Successful first round! Let's see how it plays out. I think the key
now is going to be building the board state before advancing, and
ensuring Celador doesn't leave play. I think this deck needs healing.</p>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Vassal of the Windlord.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Vassal of the Windlord and Elrond's Counsel,
Threat 24.</li>
  <li>Quest: Celador, Vassal of the Windlord for 5 Will, reveal Overgrown
trail. Threat 26</li>
  <li>Travel: Overgrown Trail.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Dunhere adds 2 more hits to Southron Company.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 27.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw A Test of Will.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Celador, Glorfindel, Vassal of the Windlord for 8 Will.
Reveal Blocking Wargs which surges to Mumak and scoop.</li>
</ol>

<p>I was going to cancel Blocking Wargs, but the surge on that cannot be
canceled.</p>

<p>Mumak has 4 Threat, really hard to get around that one. It's pretty much a
game breaker in solitaire progression, there is no way to cancel the text
box on it.</p>

<h3 id="game-27014">Game 270/14</h3>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Asfaloth</li>
  <li>Unexpected Courage</li>
  <li>Vilya</li>
  <li>Imladris Stargazer</li>
  <li>Erebor Hammersmith</li>
  <li>Bofur</li>

<h4 id="round-1-3">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw The Galadhrim's Greetings.</li>
  <li>Planning: Unexpect Courage on Elrond.</li>
  <li>Quest: Celador, Elrond, Glorfindel (threat 27), Dunhere for Will 9,
reveal Haradrim Elite, which attacks immediately and will also engage.</li>
</ol>

<p>Scoop, will lose a hero round 1.</p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Vilya</li>
  <li>Daeron's Runes</li>

  <li>Planning: Daeron's Runes draw Vilya and The Galadhrim's Greetings,
discard Vilya. Play Daeron's Runes draw Hasty Stroke and Gandalf, discard
The Galadhrim's Greetings. Play Elrond's Counsel Threat 23.</li>
  <li>Quest: All for Will 9, reveal Forest Bat to remove Dunhere and deal
2 hits to Glorfindel. Also, Threat 24. Ithilien Road cleared.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Forest Bat.</li>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.

The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
