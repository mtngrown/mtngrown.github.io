<p>After "winning" Game 24, I'm stoked to play more. I want to concentrate on getting
both VP and card draw out of the gate, with a bias towards card draw, and when
it makes sense, trade VP for military points.</p>

<p>Here's Game 25:</p>

<table class="center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Turn</th>
      <th>Score</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>18</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>34</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>59</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Turns 1 through 4 are triangular numbers, which aren't quite enough
to get a win in 6 turns.</p>

<p>This was a Alien (green) play, it just started a little bit slow.</p>

<h2 id="game-26">Game 26</h2>

<p>This play was notable for having both many yellow worlds, but also
military worlds as well. Slow start, but once it got going really
took off.</p>

<table class="center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Turn</th>
      <th>Score</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>13</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>27</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>47</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>80</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="game-27">Game 27</h2>

<p>This one ended with a 9 cost eye development, and a 9 cost
development development, both of which were pulling 8-12 VPs
per turn at the end. I don't recall ever playing either of these
in the past.</p>

<table class="center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Turn</th>
      <th>Score</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td>2</td>

    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>18</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>36</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>64</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="game-28">Game 28</h2>

<p>Another win, this time with Galactic Survey: Ceti, and Galactic Imperium.
A couple of things are coming out of the last few games. First, get something
big on the table as early as possible, let that drive the card play. Second,
playing two cards per turn as often as possible, balanced with keeping enough
cards in hand for paying cost. Also, military is crazy stupid powerful if you
can get enough of it down early enough.</p>

<p>Here's how it scored:</p>

<table class="center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Turn</th>
      <th>Score</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>27</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>51</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>A "win!"</p>

<h2 id="game-29">Game 29</h2>

<p>Didn't get going early enough.</p>

<table class="center">

    <tr>
      <th>Turn</th>
      <th>Score</th>

    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>

      <td>4</td>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
