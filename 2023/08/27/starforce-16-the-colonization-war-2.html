<p>Returning to StarForce to acquire H-index 16. I came close to deleting
this from this year's play, as I'm not interested in deep mastery of the
game. My interests have shifted over time, and I'm becoming more cognizant
of how little time I have left to play. I have a lot of unplayed games,
and several other games where I am interested in mastery.</p>

<p>In any case, I already made a Jira ticket for this, and I put into this
week's FINISHING board sprint, so let's get it on.</p>

<p>I added the <a href="/2023/06/20/starforce-15.html#the-colonization-war">rules to the initial play</a>..</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>The CBR player (that's me) moves first, then rolls on the table for the
CRC moves. I'm tracking on the usual simov sheet, analog.</p>

<h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>

<p>I moved pretty agressively, and now faced with having 3 CRC ships at
one of my locations which is defended by only two starforces along with
the stargate. Could be a short game.</p>

<h3 id="combat">Combat</h3>

<p>Combat will be at Locations 1 and E.</p>

<h4 id="location-e-bd-4">Location E: BD +4</h4>

<p>This will be interesting as SF K, a CRC unit, stayed in the LZ hence
has 3 strength points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Round 1: CRC attack 3 defend 0, CBR defend 3 attack 5, this is an
autokill of SF K, it has no chance and can do no damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Round 2: CRC attack 5 defend 0, CBR defend 5 attack 7, which is an
autokill of the Stargate. (I should have played this the opposite for
the CRC SG.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="location-1-70-ophiuchi">Location 1: 70 Ophiuchi</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Round 1: Since both my Starforces moved in, I am forced to defend at
Strength 2 each for defend 4 attack 0. CRC attack 6, defend 0. Roll 5
to eliminate CBR SF Z. Bummer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Round 2: CBR defend 5 attack 3, CRC attack 9 defend 0. CRC roll 2 for
1 step loss, CBR SF Y is eliminated. Bummer. CBR roll 6 for 2 step losses.
CRC SF H and J eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Round 3: CBR defend 3 attack 2, CRC attack 3 defend 0, which is a kill
for CBR, CRC SF G elininated..</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<h3 id="movement-1">Movement</h3>

<p>CBR to Location C, and shore up Location 1. CRC moves a starfoce to
Location 1, and defends a C as well.</p>

<h3 id="combat-1">Combat</h3>

<p>There is a weakness in this scenario with respect to combat: the
CRC do not have a combat table so I can as the CBR player always
choose what's most favorable to myself.</p>

<h4 id="location-c-altair">Location C Altair</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Round 1: CRC attack 3 defend 0, CBR defend 3, attack 3. CBR roll 9
which elminates CRC SF F. CRC roll 1 for no effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Round 2: CRC attacks 5 defends 0, CBR defends 5, attacks 4. CBR roll 1
for no effect. CRC roll 9 to eliminate CBR SF V. This went badly for CBR.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Round 3: CRC attacks 5 defends 0, CBR defends 3 attacks 3. CBR roll 4
for to eliminate Stargate C at Altair. CRC roll 8 to eliminate CBR SFs
T and U. Which is pretty much the game and 5 of 8 CBR Starforces are
eliminated.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="location-1-70-ophiuchi-1">Location 1 70 Ophiuchi</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Round 1: CBR S and X defend 2 attack 2, CRC attack 2. CRC roll 7
to eliminate S. CBR roll 7 to eliminate C.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="location-2-cd---21">Location 2 CD - 21</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Round 1: CRC attack 2 defend 0, CBR defend 3 attack 0. CRC roll 8
which eliminates X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Round 2: CBR defends 3 attack 2, CRC attack 3, defend 0. CBR roll 3
to eliminate E. CRC roll 1 for no effect.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm calling the game here as a loss as I only have 1 Starforce remaining
and CRC still has 3. I don't see any way to win it.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I am going to have to read the previous play as I "won" that game, but
I'm not seeing how from the results of this game. I am curious whether
I've played both of these correctly, and if not, which play is in error.</p>

<p>For example, I can see on <a href="/2023/06/20/starforce-15.html#turn-2">Turn 2 Location C Round 2</a>,
I should have taken a CBR Starforce loss, but I logged it as no effect.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
