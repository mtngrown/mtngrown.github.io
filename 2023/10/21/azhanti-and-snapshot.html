<p>An awesome game day as 2023 winds to a close. My usual vintage game
opponent stopped by for an afternoon of GDW goodness with Snapshot
and Azhanti High Lightning, both set in the Traveller universe.
I haven't actually played the RPG despite owning it for decades,
but my opponent had played it back in the day. I'm toying with the
notion of getting a small campaign going one day. We'll see.</p>

<h2 id="snapshot">Snapshot</h2>

<p>We have mutiny scenario with AS playing the mutineers and myself playing the
crewmembers. I set up on the bridge with a powerful captain and his trusty
stinger animal companion positioned outside the bridge. The scum mutineers
lurked in their staterooms arming and ready to rush forward, but are
unfortunately blocked by a loyal crewmember, who impeded the mutineerâ€™s
progress, unfortunately dying in the attempt. As the scum mutineers rush
towards the bridge, the trusty companion things them all to death, except for
one last mutineer who tries to infiltrate the bridge from the ship's locker and
was met by the brave captain who with his pistol shot the mutineer full of
holes, thus securing the ship.</p>

<p>Here's the end of the game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/traveller/snapshot/g1-end.jpg" alt="Snapshot end" /></p>

<p>Fast game, fairly intuitive with only a couple of rules issues.</p>

<h2 id="azhanti-high-lightning">Azhanti High Lightning</h2>

<p>Next up: Azhanti High Lightning, a game which has piqued my curiosity
since I became aware of it. Sadly, I am a little less enthused than I
wanted to be, primarily due to scale issues with the map. 1.5 meter
resolution is simply not plausible to me. It doesn't make sense. It
should be at least double that, if not 5 meter squares.</p>

<p>In any case, we pounded on the rules for a while to figure out how the
action steps worked, which is also a bit wonky. I get what they were
trying to do, but I'm not convinced they got to a plausible solution.
We did manage to get through about 4 turns, with no clear winner, and
we're intent on getting back to the table in the future. Traveller
material is likely to go into rotation, it's in our interest area.</p>

<p>Here's the setup for the Hanger scenario:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/traveller/azhanti/g1-start.jpg" alt="Azhanti High Lightning start" /></p>

<p>After about 4 turns, this is where we ended up, with one fighter destroyed, but
no clear winner.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
