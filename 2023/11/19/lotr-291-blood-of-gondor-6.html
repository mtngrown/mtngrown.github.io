<p>Taking <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/42217/basicoutlands-3.0">Basic Outlands 3.0</a>
up against Blood of Gondor again. We'll see how it works out. I like this quest so far,
and it may go into rotation.</p>

<p><strong>Update: I forgot to add The Cross-Roads to the staging area, rendering this
play moot. Since that is a Siege quest while it's in play, there are two
options: 1. get it out of play as fast as possible, or leave it in
and focus on Siege questing through Stage 1. The Threat value is only 1 for 1
player, so it's potentially an avenue of approach. Might do some deckbuilding
to deal with it instead, replace the Spirit cards with Tactics cards.</strong></p>

<p>Initial hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Steward of Gondor</li>
  <li>Hasty Stroke</li>
  <li>Daeron's Runes</li>
  <li>A Test of Will</li>
  <li>Parting Gifts</li>
  <li>Men of the West</li>
</ol>

<p>Not bad, let's try it.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Planning: Daeron's Rune, draw Hunter of Lamedon and Warrior
of Lossarnach, discard Hasty Stroke.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, reveal Evil Crow. Net +2 progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Evil Crow.</li>
  <li>Combat: Exhaust Faramir to show Orc Arsonist, which takes 3
hits and is eliminated. Hirluin defends Evil Crow shadow Lying in
Wait for no effect. Lord Alcaron kills Evil Crow. Beravor draws
Anfalas Herdsman and Knights of the Swan.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 29.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Ethir Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Planning: Steward of Gondor on Hirluin, Hunter of Lamedon,,
Warrior of Lossarnach.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, reveal Orc Rabble.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Orc Rabble.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir exhausts to find The Dark Woods which is discarded. 
Flip Brutal Uruk.  Hirluin defends Orc Rabble, shadow Scourge of Mordor
which I'm canceling with Hasty Stroke, Hirluin takes 1 hit. Hunter
of Lamedon defends Brutal Uruk, shadow Eastern Road with no effect.
Warrior of Lossarnach and Lord Alcaron kill Brutal Uruk. Beravor
draws Knights of the Swan and Ethir Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 30.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 6, draw Men of the West.</li>
  <li>Planning: Knights of the Swan x2, Anfalas Herdsman.</li>

card from start of quest.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Orc Rabble.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir exhausts to flip Orc Arsonist which is
killed with 3 hits. Hirluin defends, shadow Orc Ambusher for +1
putting 3 hits on Hirluin. Bad news. Knights of the Swan defends,
shadow Mordor Looms which whiffs as there are no hidden cards.
Beravor and Lord Alcaron kill one of Orc Ambushers, Warrior of
Lossarnach, Anfalas Herdsman and Knights of the Swan kill the other.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<p>Asterisk: I swapped in Knights of the Swan for Anfalas as that
would have been the game, and I'd like to just continue, will
revisit later. I like this quest.</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p><strong>Update: this is an invalid play: I did not put The Cross-Roads
into the Staging Area at the start of the game, which renders the
whole game moot as it requires Siege questing. I was wondering
why this felt so much easier than previous plays!</strong></p>

<p>I know Outlands is pooh-pooh'ed by the community, but I've found it's
not been the easiest deck for me to pilot, and piloting it well requires
getting through the first couple of turns. From previous experience, if
I can't get the deck firing by Turn 4, it's probably going to fail.</p>

<p>For Blood of Gondor, I think the key is dealing with Hidden Cards right
away. Don't let them build up. Remember that Faramir is going to do
3 damage where most of the enemies are 3 hits. The Brutal Uruk's are
5 hits, but only 2 defense, so if Faramir can put 3 hits on one, it's
not too difficult to knock them out same turn. Also, there are a fair
number of Treacheries and Locations in the deck, all of which whiff
when exposed as Hidden cards.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
