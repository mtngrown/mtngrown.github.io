<p>After that previous debacle where I played <a href="/2023/11/19/lotr-291-blood-of-gondor-6.html">Blood of Gondor
completely wrong from the setup</a>,
this time I am reading the set up cards really carefully. In that game, I
neglected to add The Cross-Roads to the staging area, which forces Siege
questing while it's active, which sucks in this deck.</p>

<p>Initially hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>Knights of the Swan</li>
  <li>Snowbourn Scout</li>
  <li>Warrior of Lossarnach</li>
  <li>Anfalas Herdsman</li>
  <li>Gandalf</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd like to have Steward of Gondor, which would be thematic
here (for a change), but the Snowbourn Scouts can clear The
Cross-Roads for free. So I'm keeping the hand.</p>

<p>Setup: reveal Mordor Looms, surge Orc Arsonist and take a
hidden card.</p>

<h4 id="round-1">Round 1</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 3, draw Ethir Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Snowbourn Scout.</li>
  <li>Quest: Lord Alcaron, Eowyn, Beravor, draw hidden card and reveal
Southern Road for net +3 Threat for 30 which means Orc Arsonist is coming out
and this could be the game.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Orc Arsonist.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir exhausts to find Orc Rabble which is killed by 3 hits.
Other hidden card is The Dark Woods, got some luck here. Snowbourn Scout
defends, shadow Orc Ambusher.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 31.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-2">Round 2</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Daeron's Runes.</li>
  <li>Planning: Daeron's Runes draw Gandalf and Sneak Attack,
discard Gandalf. Play Snowbourn Scout to clear The Cross-Roads.
Play Ethir Swordsman.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Hirluin, Ethir Swordsman for 8 Will, draw hidden
card, reveal Lying in Wait, reveal Mordor Looms and take another hidden
card. This is a net zero except it clears some nasty treacheries, so
kind of a win for me. Net +5 Progress.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: none.</li>
  <li>Combat: Faramir flips Orc Ambusher and discards. Flip The
Dark Woods. Snowbourn Scout defends Orc Arsonist, shadow Conflict
at the Crossroads for an additional hidden card.
defends Orc Arsonist. Beravor draws A Test of Will and Unexpected
Courage.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 32.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-3">Round 3</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 5, draw Forling. I need Steward really badly. Will
save up for it.</li>
  <li>Planning: Play Anfalas Herdsman.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Hirluin, Ethir Swordsman, draw Orc Ambusher.
Net +2 Will, throw Forlong to Eowyn for +3. I'm tempted to Sneak
Attack Gandalf in to finish the quest stage, but it would put me
in a really bad position for Stage 2.</li>
  <li>Travel: none.</li>
  <li>Encounter: Orc Arsonist, discard Anfalas Herdsman.</li>
  <li>Combat: hidden card draw, Faramir flips Evil Crow, flip
Orc Arsonist and The Dark Woods. Beravor defends Orc Arsonist,
shadow Mordor Looms and Brutal Uruk for 1 hit. Beravor takes
next Orc Arsonist undefended shadow The Dark Woods and Brutal
Uruk, dies. Lord Alcaron defends Orc Ambusher, shadow Brutal
Uruk and Ithilien Road, takes 1 hit.</li>
  <li>Refresh: Threat 33.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="round-4">Round 4</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Resource: 4, draw Forlong.</li>
  <li>Planning: none.</li>
  <li>Quest: Eowyn, Hirluin, Ethir Swordsman for Will 8, reveal
Brutal Uruk.</li>
</ol>

<p>Calling it here, too many enemies.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The general strategy here is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build the board state in Stage 1, either clearing all the hidden
cards or having the capacity to clear them. Then</li>
  <li>Power quest through Stage 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Outlands should be really good for this quest, provided it gets
going. Card it the usual thing, need to get as many of them out
as possible as fast as possible. In this game, Steward of Gondor
would have really helped. I think I should rebuild the deck with
Beregond, Defended of Rammas, and Winged Guardian and leave The
Cross-Roads in staging as it's only 1 threat.</p>

<p>Also, I forgot (again) to raise my threat by the number of hidden
cards in the play area resulting from the Black Numenorean.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
