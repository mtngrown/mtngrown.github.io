<p>As it turns out, I've only played LZ Mary a couple of times, and that
once solitaire, and once opposed. If I've documented it correctly, it
was <a href="2016/11/22/silver-bayonet-25th-anniversary-edition.html">first play of Silver Bayonet</a>.
Part of my interest for this game is to dig a bit deeper
into Vassal, which I can use at least for screenshots. This is also a
good opportunity to extend the Freeplane mindmap I started a while back.
I took a look at it and it's good to go. Will be fun adding to it.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>The scenario-specific instructions state that the FWA
made a night ambush against PANV than retreated back to
the LZ as their whole turn. Game play follows with the
PAVN turn.</p>

<h3 id="fwa-turn-1">FWA Turn 1</h3>

<p>With no artillery or air support, FWA conducts an Assault combat,
roll a 5 with per-scenario -2 DRM and no terrain modifiers, resulting
in a step loss for PAVN A/8/66. There is no Defender response here.</p>

<h3 id="pavn-turn-1">PAVN Turn 1</h3>

<p>PAVN takes exception to this state of affairs and intends
on marching to the LZ and evicting the invaders.
To this end, B/8/66 reinforces at the PAVN camp.
Then both PAVN units move to LZ. (See screen capture.)</p>

<p>Both PAVN units intend on Assaulting.  FWA is not going to refuse (cannot,
[6.2].  PAVN is coordinated by specification in the rules.  Since there is no
maneuver, assault proceeds with the defender FWA rolling 4, for no effect.
PAVN rolls 5, no effect. Second round Efficiency check rolls:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FWA: roll 8, fail ER.</li>
  <li>PAVN: roll 9, fail ER.</li>
</ul>

<p>Combat is over for this turn.</p>

<p>Here's the PAVN responding and the situation at the end of Turn 1:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/silver-bayonet/lz-mary/g23-t1-panv.png" alt="Turn 1 PAVN" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>The PAVN made a tactical mistake last turn by not at least attempting
maneuver combat. They have the coordination for it, and there is no
way to occupy the LZ without getting a retreat result, which is not
possible with Assault combat.</p>

<p>The FWA will in the meantime bombard the crap out of them before they
get a chance.</p>

<h3 id="initial-phase">Initial Phase</h3>

<p>FWA get 9 Air Points for this turn. There are no Fire markers down,
no units with Fatigue, and no HQs need replacing.</p>

<h3 id="fwa-turn-2">FWA Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">First player's plans for this turn.</p>

<p>As noted, the FWA is going to use all the Air Points available
to defang the PAVN. Have to get the reinforcements in first.
The US A/1/8  gets flown into the action to reinforce:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ADF: roll 3 miss.</li>
  <li>Hot LZ: roll 1 ER check passed, no Fatigue on reinforcement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless the PAVN gets lucky, nobody's moving anywhere, all units are staying at
the LZ.  They are, however, going to assault PAVN A/8/66!  First, need to
soften them up.  Since the Bombardment value is 9, and there are only two steps
in the target unit, there is no ADF. For the result:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Roll 3 for <code>3F</code> which is a step loss and Fatigue
for the PAVN, and another VP for FWA.</li>
</ul>

<p>The PAVN are not going to refuse combat, and there is
no reaction force. The FWA does, however, need to make
a coordination roll:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EC: roll 5 for CIDG as lead unit with ER 7, pass.</li>
</ul>

<p class="turn-sequence">1) Defender allocates and resolves air and/or artillery for Defensive
Bombardment [10.2]</p>

<p>The PAVN have no defender bombardment, so it's straight to combat:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PAVN A/8/66 roll 9, hard whiff.</li>
  <li>FWA roll 8 on column 4-6 another hard whiff.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's roll for another round:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PAVN roll 4 pass EC check.</li>
  <li>FWA roll 3 pass EC check.</li>
</ul>

<p>Second round of combat:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PAVN roll 3 which is one step loss for a VP.</li>
  <li>FWA roll 8 which is another whiff.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it for the FWA. On to PAVN,</p>

<h3 id="pavn-turn-2">PAVN Turn 2</h3>

<p>FWA has 5 VPs as it stands right now, and PAVN has 1. It's
probably impossible for PAVN to even get a draw, but we're
going to play it out and see what happens. If they can
reduce FWA by a couple of steps, I'll consider that well-played.</p>

<p>PAVN C/8/66 and the A/66 mortar unit enters play in hex 1021.</p>

<p>Once reinforcements are in play, all move except the Fatigued
B/8/66. The LZ is surrounded on 4 hexes, which will be a nice
bonus for the Manuever combat. Here's what they do:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/silver-bayonet/lz-mary/g23-pavn-t2.png" alt="End of game" /></p>

<p>Next, lob some mortars into the LZ:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A/66 fires (roll) 8, no effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>The FWA is going to hold the LZ, and not refuse combat
despite having no reaction forces available.
Since the PAVN are stated to be coordinated in the scenario-specific
rules, skip the EC check and go right to odds.</p>

<ul>
  <li>PAVN: attack with 8 (B/8/66 is Fatigued).</li>
  <li>FWA: defend with 8</li>
</ul>

<p>1-1 odds.</p>

<p>Lead units:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PAVN: C/8/66 with ER 6.</li>
  <li>FWA: A/1/9 with ER 7.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shift column 1L.</p>

<p>Neither side has any supporting fire.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">5) Attacker rolls on Maneuver Combat Table applying DRMs appropriately.</p>

<p>DRMs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From 3-4 hexes: +1</li>
  <li>LZ TDV: +2</li>
  <li>Net: +1</li>
</ul>

<p>PAVN rolls 8 + 1 which ia really bad for them, <code>A1F2</code></p>

<p>And that's this game. Here's the final situation, with
[A,B,C/8/66] all Fatigued:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/silver-bayonet/lz-mary/g23-end.png" alt="End of game" /></p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PAVN: 1.</li>
  <li>FWA: 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a really tough situation for the PAVN to get even close
to winning. There is some discussion on a forum that a better
balance for this scenario would be good to have, but no concrete
proposal as to how that may be achieved. I do think the PAVN
could have done better by manuever combat on Turn 1, but that's
something I should game out and see what happens. I will definitely
have this back out at some point.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
