<p>I'm thinking about trying to beat <em>To Catch an Orc</em>
this weekend playing solo. I don't intend on logging
all the plays, maybe not any, we'll see how I feel
about it later. I intend on using a few different
decks to get a feel for the quest, starting with the
Killer Deck.</p>

<p>I've played <em>To Catch an Orc</em> 9 times previously, but all
of those plays were cooperative.</p>

<h2 id="game-31410">Game 314/10</h2>

<p>Starting out with the <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/58832">Killer Deck</a>
just to get oriented with the quest. Right away I played it
wrong by not advancing directly to Stage 2, which I figured out
getting the loss on Round 3 when a shadow induced a second
attack which took out Theodred. I did not use Theodred for
questing in this play, which is probably an oversight. The
next game I'm going to use the same deck, but read the
quest cards more carefully and try to play it correctly.</p>

<h2 id="game-31511">Game 315/11</h2>

<p>Again with the <a href="https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/58832">Killer Deck</a>,
this game went 4 rounds and turned into location lock
with 2 enemies engages, only Henamarth out as an ally. Not
so great, scoop.</p>

<h2 id="game-31612">Game 316/12</h2>

<p>Went with a <a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/20426/singlecoreseriesmorgulvale-1.0">Mirlonde</a>
deck which starts at Threat 19. Sadly, I forgot that Rivendell
Minstrel can find Song of Wisdom for me which would really help
with resources. This deck might be hard to operate though,
given that 20 cards are out of play right from the start. If</p>

<p>Anyway, went about 5 rounds and location locked really bad.
Always seemed to end up 1 Will short of breaking even,
so the time counters chewed me up. Turns out Mugash was at the
bottom of the deck, which probably would have been a good thing!</p>

<p>Maybe Outlands next. Or Vilya.</p>

<h2 id="game-31713">Game 317/13</h2>

<p>Using the Lake Town Vilya deck did not do a lot better, arguably
worse. Location locked again, time counters filled up the staging
area, resulting in 20 Threat for 9 Will. This means all the enemies
are coming outâ€¦let's just fucking play it, someone beefed me
about scooping at some point. Everyone is exhausted except
Glorfindel, so undefended attacks. Yep. Location locked with 4
enemies engaged, Elrond is killed on the first attack which
triggers another time counter effect. A good Vilya deck should
beat this quest, maybe not progression though.</p>

<h2 id="game-31814">Game 318/14</h2>

<p>Location locked again in 3 rounds, with 3 enemies coming
out all at once with only Glorfindel ready. Scooping now.
I think the key to this scenario is questing successfully on
the first round. If that doesn't happen, I think the odds
are pretty poor for catching up.</p>

<p>Methedras stacks, so getting two of them in staging with
even one other location, it's an almost sure location lock.
Broken lands prevents placing progress on staging locations.</p>

<p>A first round success would require pretty much getting a
non-surge treachery.</p>

<h2 id="game-31915">Game 319/15</h2>

<p>Vilya deck again. This time I'm going to use Denethor to
cycle Methedras to the bottom of the deck, and hope there
aren't two in a row.</p>

<p>That worked pretty well, cycled locations down after getting
Methedras into the staging area from a surge train. Was able
to quest successfully on every round. Having Arwen out first
round certainly helped. However, I ended up getting Mugash out
on the 4th round, whereupon he killed Denethor, which is a
scoop. I wonder what else I'm missing here?</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
