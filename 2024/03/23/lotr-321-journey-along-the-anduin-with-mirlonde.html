<p>After getting hammered too many times in a row, I decided to take
<a href="https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/20426/singlecoreseriesmorgulvale-1.0">Chad's Morgul Vale Progresson
Deck</a>
for spin to see how it worked against Journey Along the Anduin. In short,
it's pretty good at turtling for board state. In this game, I got Light of
Valinor out first turn, East Bank came up early, and Denethor and Henamarth
turned it into a "Win More" fiesta pretty early. And to be honest it felt
pretty good after getting stomped so much lately between To Catch and Orc
and The Antlered Crown. A proper rage quest. I can still play the game.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-play-it">How to play it</h2>

<p>The main cards are getting Light of Valinor on Glorfindel as fast as possible,
and keeping threat super low. Here are some other tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Get the Ranger Bows in play to pick off Goblin Sniper
when it can't be engaged. This deck has a <em>lot</em> of 1 hit
point allies, and the snipers are super annoying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you get 2+ Ranger Bows out early enough, you can chip
away or even clear the Hill Troll.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leverage the East Bank hard, and be really careful about
losing it as a shadow card. Leverage action windows for
direct damage to prevent engagement when possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use Denethor at the end of combat to scry. You can get nasty
cards cycled down and he'll come back up on the refresh where
you can choose to use him again or wait to scry later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mirovor on Glorfindel and Mirlonde.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unexpected courage on Glorfindel for the extra attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shadows never deal more than +2 when undefended. With a
Warden of Healing, it's survivable in a pinch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With Gleowine out early enough, and Mithrandir's advice,
it may be possible to draw most of the deck before needing
to advance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Song of Wisdom on Glorfindel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may not need to play Gandalf at all, and he may be
of better use in a sideboard.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
