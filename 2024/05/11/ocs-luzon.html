<p>I haven't played any OCS since Burma <a href="/2020/12/26/ocs-burma-2.html">Black Cats White
Tigers</a> in 2020. The events
of 2020 (covid, puke) put me off of a lot of games in
general, and haven't mustered the time or energy to deal
with OCS since then. But I like the OCS system a lot,
and would really like to get at least one OCS game in per
year, so let's take a look at Luzon.</p>

<h2 id="game-turn-1-december-22-1941">Game Turn 1 December 22, 1941</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the upcoming turn for both sides.</p>

<p>It's December 22, 1941. The Japanese have landed at Lingayen Gulf,
a bay northwest of Manila on the island of Luzon, The Philippines.</p>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Weather determination (2.3, probably on map)</li>
  <li>First player determination, roll d6 highest has initiative, reroll for
tie (2.3).</li>
</ul>

<p>Weather roll 6 for clear weather.</p>

<p>The Japanese have the initiative for Turn 1 by the game-specific rules.</p>

<h3 id="japanese-turn-1">Japanese Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Japanese goal this turn.</p>

<p>This is split between the 48th division (Sea) in the north
landing at Lingayen, and the 48th division (Hedge) landing
at Lamon Bay in the south.</p>

<p><strong>Lingayen Gulf</strong> forces primary objective is getting everyone
as far south as possible to ensure the remainder of the forces
will be able to land unimpeded on Turn 2.</p>

<p><strong>Lamon Bay</strong> forces pursue a similar strategy, get everyone
out of the way to allow Turn 2 landings by the remainder of the
force.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>No reinforcements Turn 1.</p>

<h4 id="movement">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>48th division</strong> All onshore and moving south to contact.</p>

<p><strong>16th</strong> division, onshore and moving to Pagbilao since the
defenders there are not in position (defenders are in Move mode).
This will be a 1-1 fight, but the morale difference will matter.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>Will hold off on Air barrage this turn in favor of attempting to
get some Exploit results from combat, which would allow further
movement.</p>

<h4 id="trace-supply">Trace Supply</h4>

<p>Japanese are in trace on the first turn.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase">Reaction phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Non-phasing player releases Reserves (5.7), destroy dumps (12.11).</li>
  <li>Non-phasing player barrage (all types, 10.0) and transport.</li>
</ol>

<p>US forces have nothing in Reserve.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase">Combat phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Artillery barrage (10.1, no Air or Naval barrage)</li>
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>
</ol>

<p>Starting from the south:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The 16/16 attacks the 51/51 and 52/51 east of Pagbilao.
Odds are 1-1 with 4 shift on Action Rating. Terrain is Close
due to defenders being in a Hill hex. Surprise roll is 7 + 4
which is Surprise, roll 1 for right shift. Bummer. Roll 3 + 4
for 7 (dang!) for <code>AL1o1</code> and <code>Do1</code>. This is an attacker
eliminated result. The defenders take the retreat anyways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dagupan: Odds 4:1 in Open terrain, Surprise roll 5 + 4
for no Surprise, roll 4 + 4 = 8 with result <code>Ao1</code> and <code>D1Lo1</code>.
Really crap rolls! Chewing through supply for no benefit!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rosario: Odds 12-1, defender in hills, but the Action Ratings
are both 4. Surprise roll 7 for no surprise. Combat roll 11
(finally!) for <code>Ae3</code> and <code>DL2o2DG</code>, which is of course an
elimination for the Philippine scouts, but they'll be back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naguilian Field: Odds 5:1 with defenders in hills which is
Close terrain. Surprise roll 10 + 4 which is surprise with
a 5 shift right. This will be on the 15:1 column, roll 7 + 4
(Action Rating) which is 11, result <code>Ae3</code> and <code>D2L2oDG</code>.
Excellent results, this is what I've wanting, lots of Exploit
results.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="exploitation-phase">Exploitation phase</h4>

<p>Binalonan: the forces at Rosario advance, will engage a
defender in the village, which is Close terrain. Odds are 12:2
which is 6:1, roll 6 + 4 for Attacker Surprise, with shift 6 right.
This is column 18:1. Dang. Roll 10 + 4 for <code>Ae2</code> and <code>DL2o3DG</code>. 
I don't think I've ever been this far to the right on the OCS
CRT before. That's an elimination of course. Chewing down that
supply, will be interesting to see how far it goes.</p>

<h4 id="japanese-clean-up-phase">Japanese clean Up phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove DG and Exploitation markers.</li>
  <li>Flip or remove Fueled markers.</li>
  <li>Remove train-busting placed by Allied player.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h3 id="us-turn-1">US Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allies goal this turn.</p>

<p>Per the historical situation, Allies will start the "fighting retreat,"
attempt to protect Manila from the south as best as possible, and delay
Japanese entry to Manila from the north until after Turn 3. They might
try to get some of the southern forces over to Bataan while it's still
possible. We'll see how it plays out.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-1">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>No reinforcements Turn 1, but might be able to score some
Replacements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Luzon-specific rules: Combat and attrition elimination goes
into Recovery Pool, whence a unit may be drawn randomly. In this
case, draw 26 Scouts regiment, which is exactly what I wanted.
Place in 16.17 2 hexes north of Manila.
Remaining units go to Dead Pool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Replaments roll 8 for 1 replacement unit, will rebuild the 23/21.
Place in Hermosa 9.19, 2 hexes north of Balanga.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is awesome.</p>

<h4 id="movement-1">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Southern units moved towards Manila, with some moved beyond
Manila try and get as far north as possible to slow down the
Japanese advance.</li>
</ul>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>No Air barrage this turn, will save supply and there no
adjacant units useful for spotting.</p>

<h4 id="trace-supply-1">Trace Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">This phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Determine which units are in or out of Trace Supply (12.6)</li>
  <li>Replenish low or exhausted internal stocks (12.10)</li>
</ul>

<p>All Allied units are in Trace.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-1">Reaction phase</h4>

<p>The Japanese need to consider putting some units
in Reserve next turn.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-1">Combat phase</h4>

<p>No combat, it's a fighting retreat! Might stay engaged next
turn, we'll see.</p>

<h4 id="exploitation-phase-1">Exploitation phase</h4>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="us-clean-up-phase">US clean up phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove DG and Exploitation markers.</li>
  <li>Flip or remove Fueled markers.</li>
  <li>Remove train-busting placed by Axis player.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing to do.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-1">End of Turn 1</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly recap the turn for both sides.</p>

<p>Overall, not too shabby for the Allies considering they
pulled an excellent Scout regiment back from the dead pool,
and got lucky on the die rolls to rebuild another unit.</p>

<p>The Japanese had a bit more of fitful start, rolling stupid
bad on the first few combats, which induced both losses and
retreats when the expected outcome was Exploit.</p>

<p>Here's what the end of Turn 2 looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ocs-luzon/g1_t1.jpg" alt="End of Turn 2 Luzon" /></p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h2 id="game-turn-2">Game Turn 2</h2>

<p class="turn-sequence">Briefly summarize the upcoming turn for both sides.</p>

<p>The Allies will continue to protect Manila vigorously
for this next turn, leaving just enough forces to prevent
an easy capture in the next turn.</p>

<p>The Japanese need to shake a leg, or they will time out.</p>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase-1">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Weather determination (2.3, probably on map)</li>
  <li>First player determination, roll d6 highest has initiative, reroll for
tie (2.3).</li>
</ul>

<p>Weather roll 4 clear to fly.</p>

<p>Japanese go first again on Turn 2.</p>

<h3 id="japanese-turn-2">Japanese Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Japanese goal this turn.</p>

<p>Close in on Manila as fast as possible from the South
and north. Worry less about destroying weak units,
just ensure that any Allied units behind the Japanese line
do not endanger trace or throw supply.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-1">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-2">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>Roll 5 for replacements, fail.</p>

<h4 id="movement-2">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>All done, concentrating around Carmen Field in the north.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<p>Fly Lily, Ann, and MixB with strength 5 barrage defender at
Carmen, roll 7 - 1 for no effect.</p>

<h4 id="trace-supply-2">Trace Supply</h4>

<p>All Japanese are in Trace.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-2">Reaction phase</h4>

<p>None.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-2">Combat phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Artillery barrage (10.1, no Air or Naval barrage)</li>
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Barrage Carmen with 18 spending 3T, roll 8 - 1 for <code>DG</code>, which is
good as it will halve the defender strength.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Carmen: Roll 8 + 5 for Surprise, right shift 6 (!), roll 4 + 5 for
result <code>Ae3</code> and <code>DL2o2DG</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>East of Carmen, odds 3:1, roll Surprise 8 + 4 with shift 3 right
gives 7:1 column, roll 6 + 4 = 10 which is <code>Ae4</code> and <code>DL1o2</code>. Excellent.
Chewing through the supply!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Going to need to get as many Philipinne units off the map as possible,
otherwise they're going to be pests on the supply line.</p>

<h4 id="exploitation-phase-2">Exploitation phase</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Exploitation mode is defined in Section 5.9, with Exploition Phase
details defined in Section 11.0.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0), overruns cost 3 MP (8.1a, 8.1e prohibits
Exploitation result).</li>
  <li>Barrage segment</li>
  <li>Combat segment</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>92/91 hex 10.32 defending in a swamp (which they probably should not be in
because they didn't have enough movement, but whatever), so they will
defend Very Close.  Supply is in Tarlac, hex 11.68. As I read the rules,
hex 10.31 is prohibited as it's EZOC'ed by 9/46 regiment, and 9.32 is
prohibited for truck movement, hence 92/91 regiment is out of supply
and defending at 1. Odds 15:1, roll 2 + 4 = 6 no surprise, roll combat 6 + 4
resulting in <code>Ae4</code> and <code>DL1o2</code>. Since that's a swamp hex, will decline
to advance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>91/91 at Tayug hex 13.35, which I'm also treating as out of combat
supply as it's not in the throw range of Tarlac. The two Hill hexes
spoil the fun here for the defending unit. Odds 11.5:1.5 &gt; 7.6 = 8:1
in Close terrain. Roll surprise 8 + 4 with 1 shift right to 10:1 column,
combat roll 6 + 4 resulting in <code>Ae4</code> and <code>DL1o2</code>. Defender eliminated,
excellent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ocs-luzon/g1_t2_je.jpg" alt="Setting up Japanese Turn 2 Exploitation" /></p>

<h4 id="japanese-clean-up-phase-1">Japanese clean Up phase</h4>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove DG and Exploitation markers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Done.</p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h3 id="allies-turn-2">Allies Turn 2</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allies goal this turn.</p>

<p>Pull back! Pull back! Pull back! After losing 3 units to
Japanese aggression, the Allies need to pull back hard to
ensure the Japanese advance is slowed enough to protect Manila,
and allow holing up on the Bataan Peninsula.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-2">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft
(15.1B)</p>

<p>Not worrying about aircraft this turn.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-3">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Random draw 13/11.</li>
  <li>Roll 11 to rebuild 12/11.</li>

<p>Both placed at Manila.</p>

<h4 id="movement-3">Movement</h4>

<p>All units moved, and nothing to barrage.</p>

<h4 id="trace-supply-3">Trace Supply</h4>

<p>All units in Trace.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-3">Reaction phase</h4>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h4 id="allies-clean-up-phase">Allies clean Up phase</h4>

<p>Remove tile markers, etc.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-2">End of Turn 2</h3>

<p>Both sides did pretty well I think, at least for me
playing solitaire, with first time with Luzon, and first
OCS since 2020.</p>

<p>The Japanese probably aren't progressing fast enough,
and they aren't yet able to cut off Allied supply, which is what
they really need to do to better provision the dead pool.
Likewise with their own supply, stopping to bang away at
every pissant unit is slowing them down too much.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Allies are starting to lose units
which they will have a hard time replacing, and they are
also burning through supply. They may need to time it just
right such that the last defensive combat pretty much proceeds
from exhausted stocks. The odds won't be good, but the terrain
could be.</p>

<p>Here's what it looks like at the end of Turn 2:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ocs-luzon/g1_t2.jpg" alt="End of Turn 2" /></p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h2 id="game-turn-3-december-29-1941">Game Turn 3, December 29, 1941</h2>

<p>This is probably going to be a make or break turn
for the Japanese. They need to get to the middle of
the map this turn, and it's going to be hard.</p>

<p>The Allies seem to be in a pretty good place, they
just need to keep holding on.</p>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase-2">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

<p>Weather, roll 2 bad weather.</p>

<p>Initiative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allied: roll 8</li>
  <li>Japanese: roll 5</li>
</ul>

<p>Initiative to US!</p>

<h3 id="allied-turn-3">Allied Turn 3</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allied goal this turn.</p>

<p>This is going to hurt the Japanese really badly as all
the Allied forces in Move mode can flip to Combat mode,
move just a little bit forward to ensure the Japanese
cannot Overrun, and sit tight.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-3">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Cost 1T to refit any air base regardless of level or number of aircraft

<h4 id="reinforcement-4">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>There are no units in the Recovery Pool, which makes sense
as the Initiative creates a double turn, and units not

column 8:1 roll 4 + 4 result <code>Ao1</code> and <code>D1Lo1</code>. Take the

for no surprise, combat roll 5 + 4 result <code>Ao1</code> and <code>Do1</code>.
Attacker retreats, defenders stands.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baloc: Odds 10:3 which is 3:1 in the clear, but the Japanese
have an LT unit as well, and a Mech unit, so the odds are 14:3
which is 5:1. Surprise roll 11 + 4 with 3R for 7:1, combat
roll 7 + 4 result <code>Ae3</code> and <code>D2Lo2DG</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guimba: Odds 2:1 close, not great but whatever. The defending
unit will draw supply, this could really hurt the attacker. Surprise
roll 2 + 5 (high AR) for no surprise, combat roll 11 + 5 for
result <code>Ae3</code> and <code>DL2o2DG</code>.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allied goal this turn.</p>

<p>Very fortunate to get the initiative this turn,
as it will definitely continue to slow the Japanese
advance. Had the Japanese gotten initiative, it could
have been pretty ugly for the Allies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Los Banos, odds 7:2 is 4:1, Close terrain, roll 7 for no
surprise, combat roll 4 ugh <code>AL1</code> and <code>Do1</code>. Which is fine,
I can advance onto the supply dump. Hope I can use it, roll
5 for 50%, so 2T which will mandatory replace internal stocks.
The defending unit will attrit away most likely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>14.28 odds 15:2 is 8:1 in the Open, surprise roll 8 + 4

<p>Done.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn-4">End of Turn 4</h3>

<p>This turned out sort of ok for the Japanese, other than
losing another unit from a low adds attack. That really hurt
because the remaining Philippine units can still move back
into Trace. Having the one unit would have kept at least one
the remaining units from being in Trace.</p>

<p>End of Turn 4 situation (maybe Turn 3?)</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ocs-luzon/g1_t4.jpg" alt="Luzon Turn 4" /></p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h2 id="game-turn-5">Game Turn 5</h2>

<p>The Japanese really have no hope of winning, and I don't
think they can even get to a draw at this point. It's worth
playing it out, it will go fast, and it cool to actually
finish an OCS scenario regardless of outcome.</p>

<h3 id="pre-turn-phase-4">Pre-Turn Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Weather determination (2.3, probably on map)</li>
  <li>First player determination, roll d6 highest has initiative, reroll for

<p>Weather roll 1 bad weather.</p>

<p>Initiative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allies: 7</li>
  <li>Japanese: 8</li>
</ul>

<p>Japanese have the initiative.</p>

<h3 id="japanese-turn-5">Japanese Turn 5</h3>

<p>Hard to say what can be done with the Japanese.
They aren't <em>quite</em> close enough to get to Manila, and
don't have <em>quite</em> enough supply to do anything there
if they did. Let's see if they can move to force
the northern Philipinne forces to attrit.</p>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-7">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p>No air.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-8">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<p>Roll 10, replacement 47/48 regiment at Agoo. Move mode is
8, which is a lot on the secondary roads.</p>

<h4 id="movement-8">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<p>Turns out the Japanese can get to Manila, and within thow range too.</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Don't have enough supply to barrage Manila.</li>
  <li>11.29, barrage 18 for 3T, roll 5 for no effect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="trace-supply-8">Trace Supply</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">This phase does:</p>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Determine which units are in or out of Trace Supply (12.6)</li>
  <li>Replenish low or exhausted internal stocks (12.10)</li>
</ul>

<p>Stocks replenished, but I don't think the forces south of Manila
are in Trace due to the Scout regiment which is EZOCing the road.
One more turn and this Scout should attrit, maybe, it's AR 4.
Roll 11 and both Japanese 20/16 and 22/16 attrit. The Engineer
in Los Banos roll 11 again, dang, attrits. This puts the fucking
Scout back into Trace from Manila, at least at the moment.</p>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-8">Reaction phase</h4>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-8">Combat phase</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Artillery barrage (10.1, no Air or Naval barrage)</li>
  <li>Combat segment (9.0, artillery units strength [1] per 13.4b)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Manila: odds 4:1 in Extremely Close. Surprise roll 2 + 3 is
defender surprise shift 2L, combat 11 + 3 for <code>Ao1</code> and <code>D1Lo1</code>
so Manila falls. At least temporarily.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="exploitation-phase-8">Exploitation phase</h4>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h4 id="japanese-clean-up-phase-4">Japanese clean up phase</h4>

<p>Done.</p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h3 id="allies-turn-5">Allies Turn 5</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">Brief summary of Allies goal this turn.</p>

<p>Two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get as many units as possible back into Trace.</li>
  <li>See if Manila can be retaken.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="aircraft-refit-8">Aircraft refit</h4>

<p>No air.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-9">Reinforcement</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Per scenario specification or reinforcement track.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recovery: 89 Arty.</li>
  <li>Replacement roll 8, rebuild the 1/1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bring both in at Balanga.</p>

<h4 id="movement-9">Movement</h4>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Movement segment (6.0): 1/2 for DG (5.10), 1/4 for Reserve (5.7)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Can't get enough to Manila to make much difference, will still
roll to see what happens.</li>
  <li>Got a couple of units back into supply.</li>
</ul>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Air/Naval Barrage segment (10.2, 10.3)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>86 Arty barrage the shit out of 7 LT, roll 7 for DG.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="trace-supply-9">Trace Supply</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Units at Cabanatuan consume remaining supply,
eat off the map, 1T get 2 RE, since there are 3 RE,
requires 2T.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reaction-phase-9">Reaction phase</h4>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h4 id="combat-phase-9">Combat phase</h4>

<p>I'm calling the game here, I don't see any point in going
further. It was good enough to have the Japanese actually
capture Manila albeit pretty late in the game. Retaking
Manila would be at best 1:2 odds in Extremely Close terrain
with a -4 DRM for action differential. Every result is an
attacker loss with no effect on defender. Pointless.</p>

<p>Here's the situation at the end:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ocs-luzon/g1_end.jpg" alt="Luzon game 1 end" /></p>

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<hr class="fancy-rule" />

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>The Allies still have some small amount of supply remaining,
and this could have been effectively used had artillery been
put into Reserve.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
