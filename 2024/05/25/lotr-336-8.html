<p>Won't be much here as I'm writing the day after. But these
were good games and a nice change of pace as you will see.
Recapping the previous cycle, <em>The Ringmaker</em>, we struggled
mightily from almost the beginning, and were stumped by
several quests including <em>To Catch An Orc</em> and <em>The Antlered
Crown</em>. Both took multiple sessions to beat. It was a bit
tiring.</p>

<p>Kicking off after a several week break…</p>

<h2 id="intruders-in-chetwood">Intruders in Chetwood</h2>

<p>As usual with new quests, we rolled into this one blind
expected to get our asses kicked. As mentioned that has
been our usual experience lately. However, we found the
FFG rating of "4" matched our experience, blowing through
the quest in 6 or 7 turns. A welcome win!</p>

<p>Since that went so well, we jumped into the…</p>

<h2 id="the-weather-hills">The Weather Hills</h2>

<p>Flush with a first play win, we roll right into <em>The Weather
Hills</em> intent on exploiting as much of our lucky streak as
the cards will allow.</p>

<p>We didn't get a first play win with this quest as we botched
up the rules and did a reset on round 3 or 4. We were too deep
to easily retcon the current state.</p>

<p>The second time through we managed to get all the rules
correct for the scenario, and worked out a win in 8 or 9 turns.
Not quite a first play win, but maybe a first <em>correct</em> play win.</p>

<p>What is notable about these games is that neither of our decks
really worked as designed. My Vilya deck never really got
going, and Josh's Galadriel deck started really slow. These
were fairly easy quests, and to be sure, we did get lucky
on Encounter card draw all day long. It could have gone much,
much worse, as evidenced by previous games.</p>

<p>In all a great start to Angmar Awakended.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
