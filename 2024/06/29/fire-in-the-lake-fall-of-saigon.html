<p>It's 8:05 am, and I'd like to crank through a very large chunk
of this game today. To that end, I'm going to randomize the
turn activities with a 5 card deck of ordindary playing cards,
specifically, Ace through 5 of diamonds.</p>

<p>This will be the first Fire in the Lake game I've played since
<a href="/2019/11/24/fire-in-the-lake-19.html">November 19, 2024</a>. I think
both myself and my usual opponent have been passively avoiding it.
We have probably played a dozen games against each other over the
years. The Covid debacle did not help anything, and for whatever
reason it never got back on the table. In any case, I've been
reading a lot of Vietnam history in the last 5 years, and I'm
currently reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14611055-vietnam-from-ceasefire-to-capitulation">Vietnam from Ceasefire to
Capitulation</a>,
which goes into detail during the time period which this
game covers, to wit, the <em>Black April</em> scenario.</p>

<p>Here's the setup:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/fire-in-the-lake/g20-start.jpg" alt="Fall of Saigon set up" /></p>

<p>Let's get going!</p>

</ul>

<p>So many Aces, so much passing, at least it's making the game

card now.</p>

<h4 id="turn-19">Turn 19</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Event Card: Coup! Nixon Resigns</li>
  <li>First Eligible: ARVN</li>
  <li>Second Eligible: NVA</li>
</ul>

<p>It's 12:43 pm. I'm definitely slowing down a lot.
Getting this done today is going to be a tough one.
I think I can do it. I was wanting to play the factions
directly on the last round without using the randomizing
card draws. Not sure how I feel about that right now.
I'm 17 cards into the game, 9 more to go after the current
Coup card is resolved.</p>

<p>Check for Victory conditionw:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ARVN: 41.</li>
  <li>NVA: 6. Need to deal with War Weariness.</li>
</ul>

<p>No winner yet.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sabotage: Route 13 from An Loc.</li>
  <li>Degrade Trail: N/A.</li>
  <li>ARVN Earnings: Aid 20 + 14 Econ + 41 = 75.</li>
  <li>Insurgent Earnings NVA: 13 + 19 = 32.</li>
  <li>Insurgent Earnings VC: N/A.</li>
  <li>Casualties and Aid: N/A.</li>
  <li>Pacification: Pacify Quang Tin, Pleiku x2 for Passive Support,
Saigon to Active Support.</li>
  <li>Agitation: None.</li>
  <li>ARVN Redeploy: Police to LoCs, ARVN Troops out of Quang Nam.</li>
  <li>NVA Redeploy: Troops to Qung Tin to flip it.</li>
  <li>Adjust Control: Quang Tin flips to NVA control.</li>
  <li>Commitment: N/A.</li>
  <li>Reset: Move 5T ARVN from Casualties to Available.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="round-3">Round 3</h3>

<p>Now we're into the 1975 deck and I'm going to play both side
instead of having the cards dictate the play. This will slow
down the game a bit, but since I've worked through some of the
mechanics already, shouldn't be too bad. The cards really
helped reduce the analysis paralysis.</p>

<h4 id="turn-20">Turn 20</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Event Card: S51 VNAF</li>
  <li>First Eligible: ARVN, Event, Train Saigon,
then Armor in Saigon, Hue, Quang Tin, and Da Nang.
Air lift 4 to Quang Nam, Air Strike 4 hits on Quang
Tri.</li>
  <li>Second Eligible: NVA, OpsSA. Rally: 1A to North Vietnam,
1A to Quang Nam, Improve Trail, Infiltrate 5T to Central
Laos, Infiltrate 2G in The Fishhook.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-21">Turn 21</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Event Card: S50 Last Aid Request</li>
  <li>First Eligible: ARVN OpsSA Train 1A to Saigon. Spearhead 2A
and 4T from Saigon to Tay Ninh, remove 6T NVA from Tay Ninh.
Spearhead 1A Da Nang to Quang Tin, remove 3T NVA. This is
actually too much given the current posture, bring back the
Quang Tin pieces.</li>
  <li>Second Eligible: NVA, Event degrade US Posture to 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm starting to slow way, way down.</p>

<h4 id="turn-22">Turn 22</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Event Card: S49 The Final Dagger</li>
  <li>First Eligible: NVA, OpsSA: March to Tay Ninh, Quang Tri.
Spearhead into Quang Tri remove 3T ARVN, Quang Tri to
NVA Control.</li>
  <li>Second Eligible: ARVN Patrol, load up the LoCs with Police
units to slow down NVA movement.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-23">Turn 23</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Event Card: S52 Montagnards</li>
  <li>First Eligible: ARVN OpsSA: Assault in Tay Ninh remove
2T NVA with ARVN Troops, 1T NVA wirh Armor, and 1 Armor
with NVA Armor. Assault in Quang Nam to remove 1T NVA.
Both are now Uncontrolled. Transport 1A from Saigon
to Tay Ninh for Free Assault (Armored Cav Capability)
to remove 1A.</li>
  <li>Second Eligible: NVA LimOp Rally 5T NVA to Tay Ninh.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-24">Turn 24</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Event Card: S53 WSAG</li>
  <li>First Eligible: NVA OpsSA March, Saigon now under NVA control.
Quang Nam now under NVA control. Spearhead into Hue with 2T and 1A.</li>
  <li>Second Eligible: ARVN LimOp, move units from Tay Ninh and Binh
Tuy to regain Saigon control.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coup card very close…</p>

<h4 id="turn-25">Turn 25</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Event Card: S56 Warrior H3</li>
  <li>First Eligible: ARVN OpsSA Assault Saigon, wipe 'em out.
Raid into Kien Phong and Kien Hoa to remove 4T NVA total.</li>
  <li>Second Eligible: NVA LimOp Rally 5T into Tay Ninh. Back to
NVA control.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-26">Turn 26</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Event Card: S55 Deception</li>
  <li>First Eligible: NVA OpsSa March Kien Phong, Kien Hoa, 
Quang Tinm, Hue. Spearhead Quang Tin, NVA control.</li>
  <li>Second Eligible: ARVN LimOp Sweep Kien Phong.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="turn-27">Turn 27</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Event Card: S54 Congress Visit</li>

  <li>Second Eligible: NVA LimOp Attack Hue, NVA control.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="turn-28">Turn 28</h3>

<p>It's 3:44pm, this last round took a lot longer, as anticipated.</p>

<p>Check for Victory conditionw:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ARVN: 47.</li>
  <li>NVA: 11 control + 9 bases - 15 War Weary is 5. Something
doesn't seem right here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what it looks like:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/fire-in-the-lake/g20-end.jpg" alt="Fall of Saigon end of Game 1" /></p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>First: the War Weariness feels like a kludge. There does not
seem to be a way to reduce it, which raises the bar for the
NVA by an enormous amount.</p>

<p>Given how ARVN really cleaned up on the last couple of cards,
I'm pretty sure I wasn't paying enough attention to the US Posture
track, especially early on. I suspect I would not have gotten as
much armor on the map had I been playing that track correctly.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Black April seems pretty similar to plain old Fire
in the Lake with maybe a bit more Attack and Assault than
the base game gets, at least in proportion to total game
play. Will be playing it again soon, this next time opposed.</p>

<p>Looking forward, I think there is room for another another
scenario, which would be 1 round of 12 cards from the 1975
deck, with the Coup card shuffled into the bottom 4. This
could be a lot of fun and play very quickly, maybe even in
an hour or so. Future solitaire plays will be exploring
this game space.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
