<p>A few years ago, I decided I would play All The (Vietnam) Games.
This of course meant acquiring those games. At that time, there
did not seem to be all that many, perhaps 40 or 50, of which due
to existing interest I'd already acquired and played a significant
fraction.</p>

<p>(I'll address the situation as the date of writing in 2024 some
other time.)</p>

<p>Along the way I discovered 1. there were more games on Vietnam
than I had initially reckoned; and 2. close to a majority of
these games are not commercially or otherwise formally published,
or exist as DTP or PnP titles only. For this second point, it
means that at least some titles would require some personal
arts and crafts.</p>

<p>Some titles, such as Guild of Blades Vietnam we're covering today,
are formally published, but sold as a PnP.</p>

<p>The natural first question for any of these games including
this article's subject is "Is the game worth printing and playing?"</p>

<p>The answer: It depends.</p>

<p>For me, yes, as I have an interest in both the history of the
Vietnam War, and history of games about the war. That said, there
are varying degrees of commitment to both "printing" and
"playing."</p>

<p>For reasons I'll make explicit below, this article will focus
on game play mechanisms and intent, and not concern itself
with a full play through. And that should be sufficient.</p>

<p>One last thing: I'm fitting in this article on "chores day,"
so it's not like I'm wasting time better spent on better
games. It's my perfect time to scrape away at this and similar
obscuratica.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>

<p>Setting up is relatively simple, with not very many pieces
on the map.</p>

<p>First thing to notice is we're in alternate history or counterfactual country
immediately: the Vietnam player has access to Soviet helicopters. Cambodian
units are explicitly represented, but not Laotian units.  There is no
explanation or rationale given in the rules, we'll roll with it.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/the-vietnam-war-gob.jpg" alt="Setting up" /></p>

<p>As can be seen, everything is the same color!</p>

<h2 id="game-play">Game play</h2>

<p>Vietnam player goes first, then the US player in the
usual IGO-UGO fashion. Let's step through each phase
in detail.</p>

<h3 id="turn-1-vietnam-player">Turn 1 Vietnam player</h3>

<h4 id="phase-1-political-options">Phase 1: Political Options</h4>

<p>Both opponents have a politic events table with a number of
activities listed. Among the Vietnam player's activities,
spurring <strong>Political Unrest in South Vietnam</strong> seems like the
most appropriate. This needs to succeed before the Ho Chi
Minh Trail comes into play. Roll D10 for 3 with 1-5 being
success. Follow up rolls 50% chance of US Support dropping
1 point (fail), 50% chance of placing a VC unit in South Vietnam
(also fail).</p>

<p>This is good for North Vietnam, they can open the Ho Chi Minh
Trail next turn.</p>

<h4 id="phase-2-naval-movement">Phase 2: Naval Movement</h4>

<p>N/A for North Vietnam.</p>

<h4 id="phase-3-air-movement">Phase 3: Air Movement</h4>

<p>N/A on this turn.</p>

<h4 id="phase-4-air-combat">Phase 4: Air Combat</h4>

<p>N/A on this turn.</p>

<h4 id="phase-5-land-movement-and-combat">Phase 5: Land Movement and Combat</h4>

<p>Movement costs are provided in a table
rather than on a counter, which is fine.
Vietnam will not move anything this turn.</p>

<p>Combat is attritional, and proceeds until
there is only one faction present in the space.
Since no movement, no combat.</p>

<h4 id="phase-6-building-new-units">Phase 6: Building New Units</h4>

<p>Each turn, the Vietnam player acquires resources
based on the number of cities and towns under
control. The game starts with 12, which are not
carried over from turn to turn. This seems right.</p>

<p>For Turn 1, build:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build 4 VC for 8 RP. Place these in South Vietnam
unoccupied cities.</li>
  <li>Build 4 INF for 4 RP. Place these in Hanoi for convenience.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's it for the top of Turn 1. Let's turn to the US player.</p>

<h3 id="turn-1-us-player">Turn 1 US player</h3>

<p>The US going second feels like having to be more reactive
than proactive, at least at the start, which seems plausible.</p>

<h4 id="phase-1-political-options-1">Phase 1: Political Options</h4>

<p>Install <strong>Puppet Regime in South Vietnam</strong> seems like the best
option. Put the free infantry unit in a northern town in South
Vietnam. Roll 7, no Entry increase.</p>

<h4 id="phase-2-naval-movement-1">Phase 2: Naval Movement</h4>

<p>None this turn.</p>

<h4 id="phase-3-air-movement-1">Phase 3: Air Movement</h4>

<p>None this turn.</p>

<h4 id="phase-4-air-combat-1">Phase 4: Air Combat</h4>

<p>None this turn.</p>

<h4 id="phase-5-land-movement-and-combat-1">Phase 5: Land Movement and Combat</h4>

<p>Move 1 US to a town where there is a 1-4 VC unit.</p>

<p>Fight it out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>US rolls 7 for no hits.</li>
  <li>VC rolls 1 to destroy US unit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, that was interesting.</p>

<h4 id="phase-6-building-new-units-1">Phase 6: Building New Units</h4>

<p>I'm going to save the resources for Turn 2, but really,
I'm going to write up more of my thoughts from a play
of this first turn, then decide if I want to continue.</p>

<h4 id="phase-7-political-effects">Phase 7: Political Effects</h4>

<p>Both sides reconcile any Political Effects incurred during
the game turn. In this case there are none.</p>

<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>

<p>I think there is a game here, or perhaps close by, and possibly even something
interesting. The game's closest cousins would be <a href="/2015/08/09/viet-nam-for-interested-americans.html">Viet
Nam</a> and <a href="/2017/04/23/fall-of-south-vietnam-2.html">The Fall
of South Vietnam</a>,
both relatively light games, both of which don't quite
meet the mark. The contribution Guild of Blades Vietnam brings to the table is
the attempt to integrate politics as a top level concern for the player.
Comparing to <a href="/">Fire in the Lake</a>, here the politics are proactive rather
than reactive. In Fire in the Lake, players choose whether to respond to
political events represented by the cards. Here, the Politics are
chosen by the players, and game play results.</p>

<h3 id="the-good-stuff">The Good Stuff</h3>

<p>The game is simple. There are 2 pages of rules and a 1 page
Politics table. Movement is simple, combat is simple, and game
play proceeds quickly. There is market for these style
of game, I enjoy such myself from time to time.</p>

<p>Proactively setting poltical stance at the start of a turn
is really nice, and works well with the history of both
sides of the Vietnam War. If anything, more could have been
done with this mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="game-play-improvements">Game play improvements</h3>

<p>Here are a couple of high lift low impact suggestions which
I believe will improve game play without affecting the
overall balance (whatever that may be).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>VC units should be able to voluntarily engage in combat,
and retreat on demand. Having a "hidden" versus "exposed"
mechanic for VC units would add verisimilitude without
much game play overhead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comabt values feel unbalanced with D10. It would be much more
convenient to use D6, with a likely side effect of speeding up
game play. With VC requiring 1/10 to hit, that's a lot of wristage
for not much effect. D6 are much more efficient with buckets
of dice combat system, throw all the D6 dice at the same time for
each round of combat.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="design-is-there-development-is-not">Design is there, development is not</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, there is a viable game designed here,
but there seems to have been very little game <em>development</em>,
and certainly not with respect to the game's presentation.
Here are some suggestions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Component improvement, specifically with respect to imagery,
followed closely by generally bringing components up to modern
standards. It matters. The game as published doesn't really
meet what I'd consider prototype quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better alignment with history, specifically, ARVN units should
be included. If Cambodian unit are to be present, they should
have very little ability to affect much more than US politics.
They were not well-trained, well-led, or well-equipped.
Given Cambodian units are present, the Pathet Lao is conspicuous
by its absence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Counterfactual or alternate history is fine, as long
as there is serious consideration given to the actual history,
as well as what would be plausible. For example, based on my
reading, the Soviets were <em>really</em> not interested in getting
tangled up in Vietnam, and were in fact worried that their
involvement would trigger escalation from Washington.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And there you have it: I played it so you don't have to.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
