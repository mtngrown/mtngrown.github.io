<p>I'd like to play more of this game, but logging plays takes
so much time. An alternative is playing without logging.
Would be nice to have a turn and phase counter.</p>

<p>I'm introducing a new system for tracking counts.
The format is colon-separation like this: "scenario:game."</p>

<h3 id="game-12348">Game 12:348</h3>

<p>Start with Trial of Intuition:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stone Barrow, raises player's threat by Guardian's Threat on every attack.
This is inconvenient.</li>
  <li>Wolf Guardian, swings for the most putting a hit on Boromir even
with Gondorian Shield.</li>
</ul>

<p>These might be the two worst cards to draw at the start
of the scenario.</p>

<p>Initial hand got me Gondorian Shield, which was good, but
Wolf Guardian was the first out, which is bad. Because Wolf
Guardian puts a hit on Boromir every attack, the alternative
is chewing up all the allies which will be needed late in
the game, along with the resources for playing structural
cards.</p>

<p>Scooped when last time counter came off of Wolf, which would
have resulted in an attack killing one of my heros.</p>

<h3 id="game-13349">Game 13:349</h3>

<p>Start with Trial of Intuition:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raven's Gaurdian</li>
  <li>Cave Barrow</li>
</ul>

<p>Gondorian Shield is in my opening hand.</p>

<p>This game went 11 rounds, and ended with a +1 for each
Key held on Wolf attack, which killed Boromir. Without
Boromir, there would be no way of winning. This attack
was the result of an uncanceled Treachery. Canceling the
Treachery would not have mattered as I was already out of
allies for chumping, and the Shadow card would have come
up anyway during Combat. My other alternative would have
been to Quick Strike, which again would have resulted
in no allies defending during Combat when Boromir could
whack them all. Which he was in a great position to do
with Rohan Warhorse, Unexpected Courage, and Miruvor.
Totally doable, but with 3 hits already on him, just
not really possible.</p>

<p>I think the main strategy for this quest is stall as long 
as possible on Stage 1 to build the hand, resources, and
hulk out Boromir, then rush the last two stages as fast
as possible, picking up the 3rd key during Combat to
prevent any further Guardian attacks.</p>

<p>Good game. I might just play this a few more times to
get a 2d clean win.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
