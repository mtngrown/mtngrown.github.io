<p><em>Bad Moon Rising</em> is another of Paul Rohrbaugh's card activation
system games, and this one is probably the best of these that
I've played so far. It probably helps that my usual opponent
played. All the previous games I've played using this system
have been played solitaire, and were not as much fun.</p>

<h2 id="some-things-to-like">Some things to like</h2>

<p>Simulating a battle such as occurred at Firebase Illingworth
is both easy and difficult. The difficult part is figuring
out how mechanics for how units fight each other without
being eliminated too quickly, while still allowing a realistic
casualty rate by the end of the game. The morale mechanic
seems to be a decent way of managing this. High morale
units are more difficult to stun and kill, low morale
units much easier to stun and kill. This is coupled with
the requirement for first pinning a unit before it can
be stunned, then eliminated. I like this and haven't seen
this done anywhere else. It would work well in Stryker's War.</p>

<p>The card activation mechanic seems very appropriate. The
helps model the easy part, which is the high degree of
randomness in any of these sorts of battles. They were
intensely chaotic, and could turn one way or another
seemingly at random. Artillery and Air assets were not
always predictable, and from a game play situation, they
might as well be random. This amount of randomness
did not always feel quite right in some of the other
games using this system, but it does feel right in
Bad Moon Rising.</p>

<p>AS provided a more specific list of likes and dislikes.
Likes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overall playability.</li>
  <li>Card activation mechanic.</li>
  <li>Fast paced game play.</li>
  <li>No ZOCs to contend with.</li>
  <li>Clear, easy-to-road board.</li>
</ul>

<p>He didn't like the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lack of clarity in the rules, specifically around combat resolution.</li>
  <li>Errors in the rules, thing missing.</li>
  <li>No index.</li>
</ul>

<p>The game comes with more or less two errata sheets,
which we weren't able to fully integrate with the main
rules. Some of our difficulty would likely be remediated
if we went through the errata very carefully. But it's
still pretty annoying to deal with errors which should
have been caught during development.</p>

<h2 id="turn-sequence-clarity">Turn sequence clarity</h2>

<p>Here are a few notes for helping understand how a turn
progresses. Details are in the rules, which do not have
a turn sequence.</p>

<h3 id="start-of-turn">Start of turn</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Determine artillery.</li>
  <li>Determine US air support.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="end-of-turn">End of turn</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Resolve Ammo Dump situation starting at the end of Turn 2
(skip this in Turn 1).</li>
  <li>Remove Pinned markers.</li>
  <li>Flip Stunned Markers to Pinned.</li>
  <li>Reshuffle decks.</li>
  <li>Move the Turn Counter on the Turn Track.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="aar-and-thoughts">AAR and thoughts</h2>

<p>I want to like this game more than I do, which goes for
most of the games in the system.</p>

<p>Our game went 7 of 8 turns whence the Ammo Dump blew up,
and we called it after that.</p>

<p>Here's what it looked at around Turn 5 or so:</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
