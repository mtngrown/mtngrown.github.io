<p>Revisiting Ghosts of the Jungle as I also now have its
companion game <em>Long Range Recon Patrol</em>. I don't recall
the exact details on how to play, other than it's pretty
simple and straightforward. Hence, replaying Mission 1
again. Here is the setup at least for Mission 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SAS members roll for entry square, with roll 6
being players choicel.</li>
  <li>VC roll for placement into numbered squares.</li>
  <li>SAS loses if any one of them lose all their health.</li>
  <li>SAS wins if all of them are on the top edge of the map
at the same time, in a square without a VC.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last turn was interesting. Clarke was the last man
to move the top row, and there was a VC already in that
square, so it wasn't the win. However, I roll in alphabetical
order, so Dixon was up next, rolled a 6 and shot that the
VC in that adjecent square and caught the win.</p>

<p>Here is the result:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/ghosts-in-the-jungle/mission1-g2-end.jpg" alt="End of Mission 1 Game 2" /></p>

<h2 id="mission-2-13">Mission 2 1:3</h2>

<p>Reviewing the key structure for game tracking, we have 
Game 3 of <em>Ghosts in the Jungle</em>, with the first play of
Mission 2.</p>

<p>I believe this game is almost asterisk free. I may have missed an end of turn
roll, but I have several which rolled 5-6 which is All Quiet. Also, I used a
grenade to take out a stack of 2 VC, which was pretty cool as only one is
replaced. I also did a hand-to-hand to take out another VC. This kept the VC
under control until right at the end, but I got the win before the VC exploded
on to the map.</p>

<p>Here's the start:</p>

<p>Here's the situation at the end:</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
