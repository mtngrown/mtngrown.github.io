<p>A second Mike Lambo game on Vietnam, and this one looks
considerably more intricate than Ghosts of the Jungle.
There is a bit of print and play with respect to getting
some counters made, but I got copies and mounted them
a couple of weeks ago. Homemade counters always kind of
suck, but whatever, they'll do.</p>

<p>In <em>Ghosts</em>, individuals are moved from square to square.
This is not terribly realistic, a team of 4 is going to
try very hard to stay very close together, almost surely
at least within sight of each other.</p>

<p>Here, the team of 6 moves as a single counter on a hex
map. This is a bit more plausible. The team stays together
and moves as a unit.</p>

<p>I'm going to go through this first play methodically,
taking notes as I go. It won't be a full log, but it
will be enough to help internalize the system.</p>

<p>Turns occur in order of morning, day, and evening,
which then repeat. There is no definite end to the
game with respect to the number of turns. The game
ends when either 1. the objective is achieve and the
team is extracted, or one of the team members dies.</p>

<p>Here's the starting situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/long-range-recon-patrol/m1-g1-start.jpg" alt="LRRP Mission 1 Game 1 start" /></p>

<h4 id="turn-1-morning">Turn 1 Morning</h4>

<p>Phase 1: LRRP phase.</p>

<p>Roll 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5. This is pretty good as
it allows me 2 Cautious Moves through Jungle
hexes which avoids rolling on Jungle event table.</p>

<p>The 4 allows a Recon action, which in this case
finds and NVA-6 unit.</p>

<p>The opposition takes different actions depending
on its Alert and Pinned status.</p>

<p>The upshot of the enemy activity was getting a
wound on Watson.</p>

<p>Having conducted all the opposing actions and
resolved the end of turn event, the turn
is over and we can advance to the next turn,
advancing the Day counter as well.</p>

<h4 id="turn-2-day">Turn 2 Day</h4>

<p>LRRP rolls 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>

<p>Interesting. Actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>use the 1 roll to heal Watson.</li>
  <li>Use the 5 to attack, roll 7 dice and get no 6. Bummer.</li>
  <li>Use the 4 for Overwatch.</li>
  <li>Use the 6 for Cover.</li>
  <li>Uee the 3 to put out a Claymore.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now for enemy actions, starting with
Unpinned Alert.</p>

<p>Upshot: Another NVA-6 unit is revealed as a result of
spotting, but its attack fails, as does the Recon
Overwatch attach.</p>

<h4 id="turn-3-night">Turn 3 Night</h4>

<p>Roll 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 5.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use 1, 1 to move in the 1 direction.</li>
  <li>Use 5 to get Cover.</li>
  <li>Use 4 for Overwatch.</li>
  <li>Use 5 for Attack on the Alert NVA-6, rolling 5
dice, success to Pin them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enemy phase, starting with Pinned Alert NVA-6.</p>

<p>Roll 1, 5 which is an Attack and an Unpin, but
the Attack comes first. Roll 6 - 1 (range) - 2
(pinned) - 1 (cover) - 1 (jungle) = 1d6 for 6!
Dang! They got lucky and Pham gets wounded.</p>

<p>Actually, I think that was wrong because this is a
Night turn and they would not have any dice to roll.</p>

<h4 id="turn-4-morning">Turn 4 Morning</h4>

<p>We're back to Morning and have spend a water to
prevent -1 Strength due to dehydration.</p>

<p>LRRP roll: 1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 6.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use 6x2 for Airstrike.</li>
  <li>Use 4 for +1 Water.</li>
  <li>Reroll 1, 1 for 2, 5. No benefit to doing anything at
all right now. I'll get more water maybe, then see what
I can do.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enemy actions, with 2 of them already out.</p>

<p>Roll 1, 4: First one attacks and get a hit, taken on Young.
Then unpin.</p>

<p>The other two <code>?</code> units move aimlessly too far away to spot.</p>

<p>It's good to log this game so I can keep track of where
the game is with respect to the day/night cycle.</p>

<h3 id="turn-5-day">Turn 5 Day</h3>

<p>Roll 1, 1, 1, 4, 6.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move 3 hexes to hilltop with roll 1.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Recon roll fails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Unpinned alert: 1, 3, 4, 6.
    <ul>
      <li>Attack 1: roll 2, 3, 3, 5, 6. 6; injury on Kinsey and
Young, and since Kinsey is already injured, that's the
game!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the situation at the end of the game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/long-range-recon-patrol/m1-g1-end.jpg" alt="Mission 1 ends in disaster" /></p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I think I like it. It's still a bit abstract and puzzly, but there
is little more here than <em>Ghosts in the Jungle</em>. A big factor in losing
this game was making a rush for the exit and trying to recon the
remaining two unknown counters. It's getting later in the evening
for me, and I have my usual opponent coming over for game day
tomorrow, so this isn't all that disappointing. Given I've won 3
of 3 in Ghosts, it's sort of nice that this one bit back.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
