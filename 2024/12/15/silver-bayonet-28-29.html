<p>My usual Vietnam opponent stopped by for some hex and counter.
Today was unusual as I did not have anything ready to go, and
really didn't much inspiration either. So we spent some time
discussing various aspects of games played and yet to play.
We finally settled on Silver Bayonet, once I found my printed
rules. As it turns out, we've played all but scenarios 6A, 6B,
9, 11, and 12. In other words, we've played more than 3/4 of
the material in the box.</p>

<p>Today we decided to knock out 6A and 6B as a refresher for the
game. It's been several years since we've played, and this
would check those off the list.</p>

<h2 id="game-28-scenario-6a">Game 28 Scenario 6A</h2>

<p>This is a one turn scenario, which is Turn 25 on the campaign
track, corresponding to November 12, 1965. The scenario calls
for the VC to completely occupy the target hex, which is the
HQ and supporting artillery. They need to roll very low on
pretty much every roll to have a chance of winning this. Rolling
a 1 is almost required. Taking the VC, he failed the initial
bombardment, but knocked out a step loss on the artillery unit.
At one turn, this a VC loss.</p>

<h2 id="game-29-scenario-6b">Game 29 Scenario 6B</h2>

<p>Back to the Tea Plantation for a two turn crack at it.</p>

<p>His first roll, for Offensive Bombardment, was a 1, which
is a <code>2F</code> results, which is a step loss in that terrain.
Off to a great start for the VC. Offensive combat yielded
another step loss to eliminate the artillery unit.</p>

<p>On next the turn, corresponding to campaign Turn 26
(November 13, 1965) he got another step loss for the win.
Not bad! I'm glad to see the VC get a win out of this.</p>

<h2 id="star-realms-28">Star realms 28</h2>

<p>I did a kickstarter for a complete Star Realms collection,
which arrived over Thanksgiving. While I opened the shipping
package, I had not opened any of the material in the package.
So I brought that out and we took a look at it all, and ripped
the shrink from The Nova Collection, which is big, magnetically
sealed box with all foil cards. It's pretty sweet. We left
everything else in shrink to be opened at some future date.</p>

<p>This inspired us to play a game of the original Star Realms.
(We usually play Colony Wars.) As it turns out, I won this
one, in part by snagging a Blob base to deny him the base.
He's a Blob player, so I have to play Blob denial strategy
sometimes. I also chewed down his hits almost every turn,
a little at a time as I had no big damage cards. But it
was enough. Felt good as I usually lose this game to him.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
