<p>It's been exactly <a href="/2024/09/22/treachery-of-the-rhuadar-1-354.html">3 months since our last
play</a>.
In that time, I've traveled to Ft Wayne twice, and JL's
parents have moved into his house, from Florida, with
half of their stuff. We've both been super busy or
super distracted, or both.</p>

<p>We got our first two plays done. As expected, both were
losses, Carn Dum is rated as a really, really hard quest.</p>

<h2 id="carn-dum-1362">Carn Dum 1:362</h2>

<p>This game only went 3-4 rounds as I recall, but I
don't recall exactly why we scooped it. Probably
an impending hero kill.</p>

<h2 id="can-dum-2363">Can Dum 2:363</h2>

<p>Our second game got off to a bit better start, and we
went more rounds. We managed to get two <em>Heavy Curse</em>
Condition attachments on an active side quest, which
paralyzed our last two turns as we were unable to
play any cards. This Treachery affects <em>all</em> cards
played, not just allies.</p>

<h2 id="aar---impressions">AAR - Impressions</h2>

<p>We were expecting a combat heavy quest, but Stage 1
really was not that bad for enemies. We drew more
locations and treacheries than expected. Also, this
quest seems to have more Ally hate than anything else.
Very little Attachment or Event hate. There is a weird
Treachery which acts on card titles, which can whiff
depending on the card.</p>

<p>The other main feature of the quest is that there is
a location which switches to Battle Questing right at
the start. It needs to be cleared immediately, then
will power questing needs to ramp up fast.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
