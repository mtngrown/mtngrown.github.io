<p>Another year has gone by. More games have been played. Not as
many as I'd hoped at the beginning of the year, but possibly
enough. I believe this is the first year where I actually
acheived the goal I set out: Finish <em>The Ringmaker</em>
cycle in Lord of the Rings LCG, which I did in October.
This year, due to family-related matters, I am not setting
any goals. I also do not believe I will be playing much
solitaire, at least through Q1.</p>

<p>As <a href="/2024/12/25/designs-and-rebuilds-underway.html">noted elsewhere</a>,
work priorities have consistently trumped game (or any other)
priorities in the past, and there is no reason to believe this
will change in 2025. My current gig is tracking to switch from
contract to full time W2, which means it will take over my life.
This is how it goes in the startup niche.</p>

<h2 id="mastery-challenges">Mastery challenges</h2>

<p>Here are the mastery challenges from previous years:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<p>Roughly quarterly I jot down a few notes recapping recently game
play, or lack thereof, as the case may be.</p>

<h3 id="april-6-2025">April 6, 2025</h3>

<p>Q1 was pretty good for game play. I was <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/351321/aspirations-for-2025">enticed into making a list of
games for 2025</a>,
for which I listed 6 rather the 12 which was solicited. I've had
experience with these sorts of lists in the past, evidence in many
of these Mastery articles from previous years will attest to that.
Since many of the games will require multiple plays to acheive the
listed goal, I'm comfortable with 6 instead of 12. And indeed, I'm
already 6 games into High Frontier alone, and will need at least
one more play to achieve the goal of a fully competitive game with
Modules 0, 1, and 2.</p>

<p>Likewise, Silver Bayonet is liable to require a couple of prelimnary
games to get my opponent back into the rules. So while it's 6 titles
listed, it will be far more than 6 plays to get everything done.</p>

<h2 id="h-index-and-plays">H-index and plays</h2>

<p><strong>2025-04-11</strong> Current average plays for count of owned
games: <code>1480 / 147 = 10.06</code></p>

<p>Normally I would have some remarks with each entry describing
my plans for the year with respect to each of these games.
As of the time of writing, I just don't have any plans at all.
We'll see what the year brings.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>369/369</code> <strong>Lord of the Rings LCG</strong> I'd like to finish
out the Angmar Awakens cycle, but that is aspirational at
the time of writing. My usual collaborator is MIA, and as
of the start of Q2, no games in 2025.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>116/115</code> <strong>Absolutely Aces</strong> will likely get a few plays.
I enjoy it as a solitaire game, where the fun is attempting
to predict who will win in how many turns. I don't usually
succeed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>84/79</code> <strong>Jump Drive</strong> I did not have any plans to play
Jump Drive, but a friend is starting to get interested in
heavier games, and this is a great gateway game for modern
games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>64/64</code> <strong>Hive</strong> no plans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>61/56</code> <strong>High Frontier 4 All</strong> looks like I have a regular
competitive opponent. I'm anticipating get a lot of plays in
this year. We'll see how it goes. Also, the most logged plays by
a single person on BGG is currently 72, so I have a shot at
taking the lead on this one. Probably not this year though.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>44/44</code> <strong>Ogre</strong> no plans, but as of March, a new potential
opponent is expressing interest, so we'll see what transpires.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>38/28</code> <strong>Star Realms</strong> has gone into rotation with possibly
up to 3 people this year. It's definitely in rotation with my
usual opponent, and I've introduced it to a couple of other
people who like it. Note that this tally includes the original
base Star Realms game, along with Colony Wars and Star Realms:
Frontiers.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/tags/star-realms.html">Star Realms: TBD</a></li>
      <li><a href="/tags/colony-wars.html">Colony Wars: TBD</a></li>
      <li><a href="/tags/star-realms-frontiers.html">Frontiers: 3</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>35/35</code> <strong>Zombie Dice</strong> as opportunity presents. The game
has been tucked away, and if I had it at hand it would
probably get played more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>31/29</code> <strong>Silver Bayonet</strong> My usual opponent and I
hope to play Scenario 9, which is a half campaign. I'm
playing a number of solitaire games on Vassal to renew
my acquaintance with the rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>27/27</code> <strong>PanzerBlitz</strong> no plans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>23/22</code> <strong>6 Nimmt!</strong> is out of my collection. I play it in Ft Wayne.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>23/23</code> <strong>Fire in the Lake</strong> no plans. Will play if someone
is interested. Would like to get a 4 player game of it going.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>21/21</code> <strong>Race for the Galaxy</strong> no plans, but this is a game
which is amenable to impulse playing, so who knows? I don't
recall ever winning a game of this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>20/20</code> <strong>Ogre: Objective 218</strong> will likely see some solitaire
plays. It's fast and easy and can fit between chores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>17/16</code> <strong>GBOH</strong> will see Hoplite for sure, as it's coming from
GMT some time early in the year. 2025-03-01 Hoplite has arrived.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>16/16</code> <strong>Battle for Moscow</strong> no plans, but I played it
incorrectly on my last game, so I really should get another
play in this year to rectify that mistake.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>16/16</code> <a href="/tags/starforce.html">StarForce</a> good chance this
will get played at some point. I have a new opponent for F&amp;SF
games, and this could be right in his wheelhouse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>16/16</code> <strong>Vietnam Solitaire</strong> no plans, but might set up
the Easter Offensive later in the year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>14/14</code> <strong>Vietnam 1965-1975</strong> vague plans for setting up The
First Volley.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>13/12</code> <strong>Pandemic</strong> Play in Ft. Wayne. This is a great game
and I should play it more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Hapsburg Eclipse</strong> no plans. I think I want to sell
both this and Ottoman Sunset. Then again, I have a nascent interest
in WWI, so maybe I'll keep them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/11</code> <strong>Leaving Earth</strong> I've been working on programmatically
generating a spreadsheet tracker, and it's ready to go. All it
lacks is some game play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Objective Kiev</strong> no plans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Soviet Dawn</strong> no plans, but it's getting time to
get this back out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>12/12</code> <strong>Target Leningrad</strong> no plans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>11/11</code> <strong>OCS</strong> no plans, but I would like to get Luzon
on the table for my Usual Opponent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>9/9</code> <strong>Phantom Leader</strong> will likely see a campaign this
year. The last campaign was timed with an unfortunate work
transition, so I need to overcome a bit of a hurdle there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>France '40</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>7/7</code> <strong>Pax Porfiriana</strong> no plans, but open to play if
anyone has any interest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>6/6</code> <strong>The Agents</strong> is a new entry on this list, because I
like the game a lot, I believe it's underrated, and I could
conceivably have a shot at getting the top plays spot on the
forum. That count is currently at 22. The main thing with this
game is I haven't found a regular opponent. I may have to do
a couple more solitaire games to get the rules memorized, than
start teaching to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>3/3</code> <strong>High Frontier 3rd Edition</strong> no plans, leaving it here as a
reminder. I'd like to play it again sometime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>1/1</code> <strong>Other COIN</strong> no plans, but would be totally open
if someone else wanted to play. I am interested playing the
rest of my titles, then selling or giving them away.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="wargame-specific-h-index">Wargame-specific H-index</h3>

<p>My wargame-specific H-index started 2019 at 10. Wargames are so much
more time consuming that this index will increase much, much more slowly
than the overall H-index. I do not expect much progress on this list
in 2024.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>44</code> Ogre</li>
  <li><code>31</code> Silver Bayonet</li>
  <li><code>27</code> PanzerBlitz</li>
  <li><code>23</code> Fire in the Lake</li>
  <li><code>16</code> Battle for Moscow</li>
  <li><code>16</code> StarForce</li>
  <li><code>16</code> GBOH collectively.</li>
  <li><code>16</code> Vietnam Solitaire</li>
  <li><code>13</code> Vietnam 1965-1975</li>
  <li><code>12</code> Hapsburg Eclipse</li>
  <li><code>12</code> Objective Kiev</li>
  <li><code>12</code> Soviet Dawn</li>
  <li><code>12</code> Target Leningrad</li>
  <li><code>11</code> OCS collectively</li>
  <li><code>9</code> Phantom Leader</li>
  <li><code>7</code> France '40</li>
  <li><code>4</code> Next War series</li>
  <li><code>4</code> Ottoman Sunset</li>
  <li><code>3</code> The Arduous Beginning</li>
  <li><code>2</code> Winter War</li>
  <li><code>1</code> COIN</li>
  <li><code>1</code> Combat Commander, which is on this list because it's the
kind of game I will like, once I find someone who is willing to
play it.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's emough fpr mow.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
