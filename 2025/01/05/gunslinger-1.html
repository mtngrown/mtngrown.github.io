<p>After years of talking about it, we finally got
Gunslinger to the table. And it's about what we
expected, pretty awesome! While the rules seem
extensive and fiddly, it turns out the game play
isn't that difficult, and the rules for the most
part make common sense. You can't fire your Colt 45
until you have 1. drawn it from your holster,
and 2. cocked it. Makes perfect sense when turns
are 5 segments of 0.4 seconds each. Brilliant.</p>

<p>For our first game, we played Scenario 1, small version.
My usual opponent took The Quiet Man, Johnny Ringo.
I had The Gambler, Doc Holliday.</p>

<p>The game went 5 turns.</p>

<p>Johnny shot Doc's Other Hand on Doc on Turn 1,
followed by Doc knocking Johnny down with a Stagger.</p>

<p>Doc then advanced and shot and missed
while Johnny got up and turned around. Johnny's
next shot knocked Doc to the ground with a head
shot Stun . While Doc was recovering and attempting to
get up, Johnny scored a critical hit killing
Doc.</p>

<p>What a great game! This can play out fast enough to
be a filler game, or something we play at the end
of the day once the main event is over.</p>

<h2 id="star-realms">Star Realms</h2>

<p>We have renewed interest since my giant Star Realms
kickstarter arrived. At the moment, we're playing
Star Realms proper, rather than Colony Wars.</p>

<p>I played a scrapping strategy, AS played a non-Blob
strategy. I managed to scrap 8 cards from my starting
hand, leaving me with some big damage cards and some
good combos. I was in a position where I would be
able to scrap almost every turn by the end of the
game.</p>

<p>AS did not have a coherent strategy this game. He
normally plays Blobs and quite often wins as he
can inflict so much damage before I can get a
hand working.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
