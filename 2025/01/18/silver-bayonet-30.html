<p>I've played Tea Time over a dozen times most likely, and I keep finding new
details.  For example, I've been playing - and by extension - our competitive
games with the Attack Coordination rules interpeted incorrectly, particularly
with respect to Assault Combat. Rolls which are 2 or more greater than the
Efficiency Rating of the attacking unit go into Frontal Assault, which means
only one of the stacks may attack. I think that's too strict really, but that's
the way the rule is written.</p>

<p>I think it would make more sense that the attacking units would make separate
rolls on the attack rather than a combined roll. I might ask about it sometime.</p>

<p>Also, I've (we've) been playing Air Defense inconsistently at best. Air Defense
only occurs when there is more steps defending than Air Points attacking.
This includes when Air is being used for Defensive Bombardment.</p>

<p>Anyway, I played through the scenario very carefully, and recorded the
results on a spreadsheet I started a couple of years ago.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/silver-bayonet/g30.png" alt="Silver Bayonet Game 30" /></p>

<p>Frontal Assault is just brutally ineffective.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting rule:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/silver-bayonet/headhunters.png" alt="1/9 Headhunters" /></p>

<p>The 1/9 alone accounted for half the kills in their area
of operations. Do not fuck with the Headhunters.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-now">Where to now?</h2>

<p>My goal for this sequence of game plays was deriving a complete
results tree which would show all possible outcomes at each step.
The added complexity of correctly playing coordination, and the
variability of the Air bombardment make this difficult. For
example, supposing I only brought 5 air points to bear, then
I would need to have Air Defense, twice rather than not at all.
I'm not willing to abandon the project, but it's going to have
to morph a bit. Building a mind mind won't be as straightforward
as I was expecting.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
