<p>Following the numbering scheme defined for playing
Lord of the Rings LCG, the numbers 3:31 indicate
the fourth play of LZ Mary (Scenario 3) and the
31st game of Silver Bayonet.</p>

<p>This is another Vassal game, a follow up to the
<a href="/2024/01/24/lz-mary-revisited.html">previous LZ Mary Vassal game</a>
which was almost exactly one year ago. I have not
played anything on Vassal since then, but I do recall
it wasn't too bad once I committed to it. I don't recall
how much of the game play was completely in Vassal, but
I'm going to attempt to keep as much as possible in Vassal
for this play. As much because I don't feel like getting
out of my comfortable chair to chase down rules and player
aids and charts if those are available in the module.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p><strong>Ambush!</strong> The FWA makes an ambush attack on the PAVN in hex 1021,
where the PAVN do not get defensive assault fire. This
is a complete freebie for the FWA.</p>

<p>FWA attacking with 3, roll 8 - 2 DRM for 6 which is <code>-</code>
no effect. Bummer.</p>

<p><strong>PAVN response</strong></p>

<p>The PAVN bring in reinforcements, then maneuver around the LZ:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/silver-bayonet/lz-mary/g31-t1-nva-move.png" alt="PAVN first maneuver" /></p>

<p>In the previous game, I forgot that the PAVN were automatically
coordinated for this scenario, and did not conduct a maneuver
combat, which is what we're going to do here. Here's the sequence:</p>

<p>Maneuver Combat Step [8.3]</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Determine Combat Odds</em>: PAVN 8, FWA 4, 2:1 odds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Choose lead units</em>: PAVN A/8/66, FWA A/1/9.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Determine column shifts based on ER difference between lead units</em>:
Shift 1L for FWA benefit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Both sides, attacker first, allocate support fires from air and/ or
artillery. Then, both sides resolve support fires</em>: No supporting fire
for either side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Attacker rolls on Maneuver Combat Table applying any
DRMs</em>. PAVN rolls 2 + 2 DRM for defender in Light Jungle. result is 4,
which is <code>D1</code> on the 1.5:1 column.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Extract losses, conduct retreats, apply Fatigue</em>:
With TDV of 2 we have 1/2 = 0, so there is no step loss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>If defender vacates hex, attacking units may advance</em>. N/A.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Score</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>FWA: 3</li>
  <li>PAVN: 0</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>The FWA is going to have to bombard their way to some PAVN
step losses, which PAVN will need to execute a combined
maneuver and assualt to either destroy steps or get a retreat.</p>

<h3 id="initial--recovery-phases">Initial &amp; Recovery Phases</h3>

<ul>
  <li>FWA gets 9 Air Points.</li>
  <li>There are no First or Final Fire markers to remove.</li>
  <li>There is no Fatigue to recover.</li>
  <li>There are no HQ to replace.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fwa-turn-2">FWA Turn 2</h3>

<p>Reinforcements flown in by helicopter.</p>

<p>There is no reason to move anywhere given the LZ is under
attack by the PAVN.</p>

<p>No reason for the FWA to attack either, when they have a better
chance at getting step losses on the PAVN from defensive
bombardment, with much less risk. FWA is done here.</p>

<h3 id="pavn-turn-2">PAVN Turn 2</h3>

<p>Reinforcements to hex 1021.</p>

<p>All move to envelopment the LZ:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/silver-bayonet/lz-mary/g31-t2-pavn-move.png" alt="PAVN Turn 2 movement" /></p>

<p>Since by scenario rules, this attack is automatically coordinated,
we step into maneuver combat next.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Determine Combat Odds</em>: PAVN 12, FWA 8, 1.5:1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Choose lead units</em>:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>From the Special Units rules, the A/1/9
does not appear to be prevented from being the lead unit when
in a defending stack.</li>
  <li>PAVN chooses A/8/66.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Determine column shifts based on ER difference between lead units</em>:
The ER comparison is 1L to the FWA favor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Both sides, attacker first, allocate support fires from air and/or
artillery. Then, both sides resolve support fires</em>:
- PAVN uses the mortar for supporting fire, roll 5 for <code>1</code> with TDV 2
for no effect.
- FWA brings in 9 Air, with only 3.5 steps attacking there is no
Air Defense Fire (ADF). However, there is a mortar artillery unit
which can be used, roll to hit: 8, for a miss. Bombardment roll
is a 10, which is <code>-</code> for no effect. Dang!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Neither side has any support.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Attacker rolls on Maneuver Combat Table applying any DRMs</em>.
Roll 8, which is <code>AF3</code>, not a great result for PAVN.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Extract losses, conduct retreats, apply Fatigue</em>:
Fatigue to all units in the 8/66. I predict there will be
some criticism coming down from Hanoi.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>If defender vacates hex, attacking units may advance</em>.
N/A.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is the game.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/silver-bayonet/lz-mary/g31-end.png" alt="End of game" /></p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>This was a good experience, both with Vassal and using Maneuver
Combat, which we really use in our games. My interest in using
it more is that when it can be used, it has the potentially to
get a fair number of Fatigue results on the FWA units, which are
much more problematic to recover, basically having the field
for a turn or more. The PAVN can deal with Fatigue easier with
HQs and mobile hospitals.</p>

<p>I don't see how the PAVN can win this scenario except by
extraordinary luck.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
