<p>(Note: game started 2024-11-17.)</p>

<p><em>Recon Team: Vietnam</em> is a print and play title from Berserker
Games. I have had this printed out for years, but the form
factor is so unusual it's been difficult to summon the energy
to unscramble the rules. I suspect at heart it's a fairly
simple game, but extracting that simplicity is a challenge.</p>

<p>I also did not completely prep the game for playing at the
time I printed it. I suspect my enthusiasm waned pretty quickly
when confronted by the amount of work it was going to take
to render the printed material playable.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-mission">Running a mission</h2>

<p>The overall sequence is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Draw Mission Card</li>
  <li>Logistics Phase</li>
  <li>Operations Phase</li>
  <li>Mission Completion Check</li>
  <li>Victory Point Calculation Phase</li>
  <li>Soldier Replacment Check Phase</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these will be examined in more detail as the
first game plays out. We'll start with determining a mission.</p>

<h2 id="draw-mission-card">Draw Mission Card</h2>

<p>The mission cards are small, but double-sided. I
actually like the size, I do wich they were a much
closer fit standard small sleeves, that would be
super cool.</p>

<p>Each Mission Card has a mission title and a standard
layout with the details for conducting a mission. Here
is an example for a PHOENIX OP mission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set-Up: Place Leader Objective and 4 Decoys in Hexes: A3, B3, B5, D4 and E4.</li>
  <li>Mission: Kill or Capture</li>
  <li>Leader Objective for 5VP.</li>
  <li>Operations: 10</li>
  <li>Team Size: 5 (1x\(\bigoplus\) ,1x<span style="color: gold; font-size: 1.5em;">✴</span> ).</li>
  <li>Insertion: Helicopter.</li>
  <li>Support Points: 8</li>
</ul>

<p>The Team Size also defines  requirements specified by
icons which have the following meanings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1x\(\bigoplus\) means there needs to be at least one sniper on the
team.</li>
  <li>1x<span style="color: gold; font-size: 1.5em; vertical-align: -0.15em;">✴</span> means
at least one intel team member.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules on platoon formation are not completely clear. For this
mission I'm going to separate the various specialists as directed
by the rules, draw on of each specialist required for the mission,
then draw the remaining 3 randomly.</p>

<p>On to logistics.</p>

<h2 id="logistic-phase">Logistic Phase</h2>

<p>With 8 Support Points, there's not a lot of slack
here, especially when Extraction, Fire Support, and
Medevac have to be specifically paid for. That seems
very odd at the scale of an individual team. Normally
that would budgeted at the command level. For Force
Recon, that would be a responsibility of the Force
(MEF) commander.</p>

<p>Anyways, let's budget:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 for extraction</li>
  <li>1 for medkit</li>
</ul>

<p>We're not carrying any extra equipment. This leaves 6
for either Victory Points (VPs) or fire support or whatever.</p>

<p>Now we can start operating.</p>

<h2 id="operations-phase">Operations Phase</h2>

<p>The Operations Phase repeats each step until the operation
is complete or another event ends the operation. We'll play
this learning in a series of "operational rounds."</p>

<h3 id="round-1-insertion">Round 1 Insertion</h3>

<p>Helicopter Insertion is covered in the reference sheet on the top of
Sheet 3. I'm going to insert in hex H3, which is a paddy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>7 hexes for movement, event on 1D6 = 1, no event.</li>
  <li>LZ roll 2, which is Ho LZ, roll 2D6 for 9, which is
a roll on the Combat table, roll 4 for no effect.
Squad unasses the helicopter, which moves back to base.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/recon-team-vietnam/g1-insertion.jpg" alt="Insertion" /></p>

<p>Time to move:</p>

<ul>
  <li>G4, Jungle, roll 3 no event.</li>
  <li>F4, Jungle, roll 4 no event.</li>
  <li>E4, Village with Objective, roll 5 for no effect,
Objective is a decoy,</li>
</ul>

<p>For Combat, assume D3, roll 1, +3 for 4; enemy drawn
randomly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 VC units: 3 x C, 1 x D. All have Attack 4 for 16
total.</li>
  <li>Team Attack value is 25.</li>
  <li>US initiative, roll 7, D. (Is this applied to the defenders
as a whole, or to each defender, or to just one defender?)</li>
  <li>Damage table:
    <ul>
      <li>VC1: C, D, 8, E</li>
      <li>VC2: C, 12, D2, 12, E</li>
      <li>VC3: C, 6. D-1, 8-1 = 7, HC</li>
      <li>VC4: D, 9, D1, 6+1 = 7, E</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Return fire:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vimy: 12, D1, 10+1, E</li>
  <li>Otto: 8, D, 3, I</li>
  <li>Alex: 10, D, 6, LC and 6 to withdraw</li>
  <li>Chris: 4, no effect?</li>
  <li>Barry: 7, D-1, 6-1 = 5, LC no effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Leader Objective</p>

<ul>
  <li>D6 - 2: roll 3 - 2 = 1 unit with him.</li>
  <li>Otto is sniper, attempts a kill shot, roll for E.
    <ul>
      <li>What happens to OpFor now?</li>
      <li>Can sniper preempt initiative?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Initiative rolls:
    <ul>
      <li>Leader 2, 3
Team: 5, sniper kill.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Leader is killed, now it's time for extraction: 
roll 8 AA fire in 2d hex.  roll 5 for no effect.</p>

<p>Victory Points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VC eliminated: 3</li>
  <li>Leader eliminated: 3</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: 6.</p>

<p>Not great, but ok.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, and I am definitely
going to play it at least once more, and probably several more
times. It's inspired me to get Thud Ridge printed as well.</p>

<p>I do have questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What's the best way to understand how turns or rounds are
structured? This single playthrough didn't give me enough
context to figure it out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens to the helicopter post insertion? I'm thinking it
goes back to base without effect as it would fly very high outside
of small arms range, might attract AA though. This game I just moved
it back to base.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not clear on the combat sequence, and need to review my
correspondence with the designer to ensure my questions about
it were clear. The main thing is how results are applied, whether
once against the entire team or OpFor, or individually.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And onward to the next play!</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
