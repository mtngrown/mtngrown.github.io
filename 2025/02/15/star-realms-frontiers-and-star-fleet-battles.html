<p>Was at a loose end during the afternoon, and rousted up Josh
for a couple of games. He had just received Star Realms Frontiers,
so we gave it a go. It has this interesting "double ally"
mechanic which I think is unique to the Frontiers set. Maybe
also scrapping from the trade row for Blob damage. Not sure
about that one.</p>

<p>I made an error when using the trade row scrap by putting the
scrapped card in my discard pile then playing it. I may have
botched the double allow on that card as well, not sure. In
any case, while it was a notional win for me, I'm not claiming
a win as I botched the card play so badly. I'm sure we'll play
many more times.</p>

<h2 id="star-fleet-battles">Star Fleet Battles</h2>

<p>Josh picked up Star Fleet Battles probably over a year ago, but
had not had any success getting through the rules. For this
game, I showed him how to get going on these sorts of games,
which is more or less just get going. Don't worry about getting
things right, or developing strategy, or pretty much anything
other than very basically following the turn sequence, moving,
and shooting. It won't be right, but it will help for understanding
the general game play.</p>

<p>So we grabbed a couple of ships. I took the Federation, Josh
took the Klingons. We played 4 or 5 turns, learned the rudiments
of moving, how the impulse system worked, and a little bit about
phasers and shields worked. We called it a game there, fairly
well satisfied that we have an entry point into the rules now.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
