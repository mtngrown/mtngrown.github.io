<p>(Game started March 10, 2025.)</p>

<p>I've been doing a bit of spreadsheet programming lately.
Both in terms of creating programs within spreadsheets,
and programmatically creating spreadsheets, specifically
on Google Drive. I'm paying for a Workspace account so I
might as well use it. In the past, I kept up with successive
releases of Microsoft Office because everyone else was
using it, but I never used it myself and got tired of the
expense and update cycle. Sheets isn't great, but it's
good enough for what I want to do.</p>

<p>Currently, I have a Ruby application (command line) which
will create a sheet on my Google Drive account and
pre-populate specified missions. This game is for helping
determine what the next round of improvements will be.
I haven't played Leaving Earth in many years, so it's
going to take a couple of days of squeezing in the time
to figure out the rules again.</p>

<p>The solitaire game of Leaving Earth is distinctly
different than the competitive game, at least for me.
In the competitive game, players must take many more
risks to win compared to the solitaire game. In the
solitaire game, winning is a matter of planning, nearly
all of which can be done up front, after the missions
are chosen, and before any advancement is purchases.</p>

<h2 id="planning-in-the-solitaire-game">Planning in the solitaire game</h2>

<p>Since there is no competitive pressure, the game
orients itself to the time clock. There is a 20
year window to accomplish a victory, and every
year and every mission can be scoped in advance.</p>

<p>Planning can be separated into three stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reverse calculation of mission needs from Earth Orbit;</li>
  <li>Launching components into Earth Orbit;</li>
  <li>Scheduling missions and advancements to minimize risk.</li>
</ol>

<p>In a competitive game, risk has to be assessed with
the actions of the competition rather than the state
of advancements alone.</p>

<p>In the present game, Easy Mode, there are five
Easy missions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mars Survey</li>
  <li>Lunar Survey</li>
  <li>Man In Orbit</li>
  <li>Man in Space</li>
  <li>Sounding Rocket</li>
</ol>

<p>In the solitaire game, these can be grouped into
three, let's call them "projects." Each project
consists of one or more more missions which can
be accomplished all at once:</p>

<p><strong>Project 1</strong>: Mars Survey. We need to get a Probe
to Mars Orbit or Flyby, and have it be successful.</p>

<p><strong>Project 2</strong>: Lunar Survey. We need get a Probe to
Lunar Orbit or Flyby and have it be successful.</p>

<p><strong>Project 3</strong>: Man in Orbit. Getting a man in orbit
will satisfy the Man In Space and Sounding Rocket
missions as well. It's likely that Sounding Rocket
will also be satisfied during Advancement testing.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-planning-or-working-backwards">Reverse planning, or, working backwards</h2>

<p>The notion is to assume we have a successful mission
completion state, and work backwards through the steps
which produce that state.</p>

<p>For example, a Mars Survey requires getting a Probe to
Mars, which will work correctly (not have a Major or
Minor Failure) when the Survey is attempted. Assuming
the Probe succeeds, we need to get the Probe to Mars,
which requires composing a spacecraft consisting of
the Probe and a successfully operating Thruster. In
turn, we need to get one or more thrusters succesfully
launched into Earth Orbit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make a list of all the components I will need to
purchase.</li>
  <li>Make a list of the necessary advancements I will
need to purchase.</li>
  <li>Compute a few maneuvers without worrying about the
spreadsheet for now.</li>
</ul>

<p>(<code>vim macro is @t</code>)</p>

<h4 id="year-1956">Year 1956</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Purchases: Atlas and Soyuz Advancements for $20,
and 1 Atlas rocket.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Planning: Early game planning is all about purchsing
and however much risk mitigation by way of testing makes
sense in the context of the game. For an easy solitaire
game, we'll test everything to success, that is, remove
all of the outcome cards.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That's all the money spent for 1956.</p>

<h4 id="year-1957">Year 1957</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Purchases: 3 Soyuz and 1 Probe.</li>
  <li>Planning: We only lack the Surveying Advancement
and we can start testing (and repurchasing) rockets.
We don't even need a Rendezvous as once the rocket
stages have fire they are discarded.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="year-1958">Year 1958</h4>

<p>For the Probe to work, we'll need to Survey, which also
requires an Advancement. Or, we could start testing.
Let's test Soyuz.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Purchases:</li>
  <li>Planning: Test Soyuz twice, and if both successes
then purchase an Atlas. If one or more failures, test
to completion.</li>
  <li>Testing: Soyuz 1: Failure; Soyuz 2: Success;
Soyuz 3: Success.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Soyuz Advancement is complete!</p>

<h4 id="year-1959">Year 1959</h4>

<p>Getting a Man In Orbit will require a Capsule of some
sort, so we'll need to add that to our list at some point.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Planning: Let's test all the Atlas rockets right now,
and we'll need to purchase another one for complete testing.</li>
  <li>Purchases:</li>
  <li>Testing: Atlas success.</li>
  <li>Action: purchase Atlas.</li>
  <li>Action: test Atlas, success.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now we have one Outcome remaining on our Atlas Advancement.</p>

<p><strong>BLUNDER</strong> I paid to remove the last Success Outcome,
which was unnecessary. I could leave it on there as being
the only remaining outcome, I would know what the result
would be.</p>

<h4 id="year-1960">Year 1960</h4>

<p><strong>Planning</strong> Since Astronauts have 0 Mass (with respect to game play),
we can choose the Apollo Capsule at Mass 1 to allow a single
Soyuz to boost the Capsule into Orbit. The Apollo Capsule
require the Landing Advancement, which we won't actually
need in this game.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Purchase Surveying Advancement</li>
  <li>Purchase Atlas rocket</li>
  <li>Test Atlas rocket, success</li>
</ol>

<p>We're almost ready to start running the missions. In a competitve
game, it makes sense to take more calculated risks.</p>

<h4 id="year-1961">Year 1961</h4>

<p><strong>Planning</strong>
Let's purchase a Soyuz and start testing Surveying from
Earth Orbit. This let's us be assured that our surveying
won't fail at Luna and Mars. Also, this is likely superfluous,
as the Probe is not damaged when Surveying fails, a point
I believe I have been playing incorrectly in the past.
This would hold true for Capsules as well. Nevertheless,
let's do it anyway.</p>

<p>We'll survey Solar Radiation.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Puchase Soyuz.</li>
  <li>Launch Probe with Soyuz.</li>
  <li>Test Surveying, major failure.</li>
  <li>Test Surveying, success, Solar Radiation reveals
"No Significant Radiation."</li>
  <li>Test Surveying, success. I don't need to pay for
this one as it's automatic. If it had been a Failure, I
would have been stuck, as I only have $2 remaining, and
would have to try again next turn. That's low risk with
Surveying, could be more expensive with rockets.</li>
</ol>

<p>Score: 1 for Sounding Rocket.</p>

<h4 id="year-1962">Year 1962</h4>

<p><strong>Planning</strong> We can survey the moon no problem, and
get set up for surverying Mars.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Purchase Soyuz x 2, Atlas x 1, Probe x 2. This</li>
  <li>Launch Probe and Atlas to to Earth Orbit using
both Soyuz as stages 1 &amp; 2.</li>
  <li>Fire the Atlas to manuever to Lunar Flyby.</li>
  <li>Survey Luna, finding Valuable Minerals.</li>
</ol>

<p>We still have a Probe in Earth Orbit, but it might be
cheaper to boost a new one than to attempt the Rendezvous.</p>

<p>Score 1 + 4 for Lunar Survey.</p>

<h4 id="year-1963">Year 1963</h4>

<p><strong>Planning</strong> For the Man In Orbit, we have to bring him
back down again. Let's postpone that until the 3 year
Mars mission is underway.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Purchase Soyuz x 2, Atlas x 1, Eagle Capsule.</li>
  <li>Launch Probe and Atlas to to Earth Orbit using
both Soyuz as stages 1 &amp; 2.</li>
  <li>Fire the Atlas and Probe for Mars Flyby with 3 Time
Tokens. Tokens are removed at the end of 1965, we can
Survey Mars at the start of 1966 (we must, in fact, or
the Probe will be lost).</li>
</ol>

<p>Remove one Time Token from Mar mission.</p>

<h4 id="year-1964">Year 1964</h4>

<p><strong>Planning</strong> now it's time to figure out how to get a
man to orbit and back. We need to Test the Landing
Advancement. Our options are to purchase a Juno
Advancement and test with cheap rockets, or purchase
Atlas rockets for more money, but save on the advancement
cost. We'll need to buy a couple of Soyuz rockets as well,
so those can be purchases where it best conserves the spend.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Purchase Landing Advancement, Soyuz, Atlas and Probe for $24.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can't do anything with the left over $1. In a competitive
game, it might be worth buying gear or supplies for trading.</p>

<p>Remove Time Token 2 from Mars mission.</p>

<h4 id="year-1965">Year 1965</h4>

<p><strong>Planning</strong> what I should have done last year is started
Tests for Landing. I'll do that now.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Launch Atlas with Probe to Suborbital, test landing.</li>
  <li>Purchase Soyuz, Atlas, Probe x 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remove last Time Token from Mars mission, will survey
at the beginning of the next year to get more victory
points.</p>

<p><strong>Inventory</strong></p>

<p>Soyuz, Atlas, Probe x 2, Eagle.</p>

<h4 id="section">1966</h4>

<p><strong>Planning</strong> The Landing Advancement still has 2 Outcomes
on it, which need to be cleared, so that would be a good
thing to do this turn. Also need to perform Mars Survey.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Launch Atlas and Probe to Suborbital.</li>
  <li>Test Landing, pay $10 success.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Survey Mars, success finding Valuable Minerals.
Score 5 points for 10 total.</p>

    <p>This is technical a win for the game as I've now scored 10
of 14 points, that is, more than half. Let's play it out
and put a man in orbit and back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Purchase Atlas for $4.</li>
  <li>Launch Atlas, test Landing, success and no need to spend
just discard it as it's the last Outcome.</li>
  <li>Purchase Aldrin.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="section-1">1967</h4>

<p><strong>Planning</strong> it looks like I can just launch and land Aldrin
and I've got the Man In Orbit mission. All the Advancements
are tested and I have all the components necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Launch Soyuz with Eagle and Aldrin to Earth Orbit.</li>
  <li>Land the Eagle capsule.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: Man in Orbit and back also gains Man In Space and back,
the total is 6 points.</p>

<p>Score: 16.</p>

<h2 id="some-pictures-associated-with-this-game">Some pictures associated with this game</h2>

<p>At the beginning of a game, I like to get a notion of which
rockets and other components I will need to conduct missions.
Here's a picture of what I thought I would use, but it turns
out I did not need the Ion rocket. What should be there is
the Eagle Capsule.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/leaving-earth/g12-starting-rockets.jpg" alt="Components" /></p>

<p>The missions are marked with black cones. I will use yellow or
orange cones next time as the black cones are too difficult to
see on the image.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/leaving-earth/g12-setup.jpg" alt="Setting up Game 12" /></p>

<p>I initial started with CNES, and decided for some reason to
change to NASA. I'm keeping the image below as I have a plan
for working with the perspective.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/leaving-earth/game-12-start.jpg" alt="Perspective view" /></p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Not a bad game. I ended up having to put it away to clear the
table for a High Frontier game, but I was able to save the game
state well enough to easily restart. The next game will be a
Medium difficulty game, which will be after more Google Sheets
updates.</p>

<p>On a side note, I'm really disappointed that Google doesn't
provided a publically supported API for better styling of
individual cells. A real bummer and killed most of my
motivation for automating with Google. Apparently they
maintain a private API. I may have to dig into the actual
API documentation though. This could be a limitation of
the Ruby gem rather than the actual public API.</p>

<h3 id="updates-for-spreadsheet">Updates for spreadsheet</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Add a "Spacecraft Thrust" column between G and H. This
will for computation without the need for creating some
sort of custom Javascript.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Center the text in more if not all of the columns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add an Earth Orbit tab on all sheets. Everything needs
to go there anyway, and the usual technique is get things
into orbit and assemble them there. That said, it might
be fun to try to do a one shot for a Lunar or Mars Survey.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add Total Score column with the formula already provisioned
on the Schedule sheet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also: check the actual API documentation to ensure GPT wasn't
lying to me about what is and is not supported via the Ruby
gem.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
