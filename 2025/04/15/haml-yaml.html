Knowing when to cut and run is a great skill to have, because
there's nothing like continuing to invest in sunk cost projects.
Given a recent opportunity to cut my losses on the many in-draft
articles here on this site, I naturally decided to double down
and actually finish a few of them (possibly all of them).
</p>
<p>
This article was started February 15, 2016. In the intervening years, I've
changed employment a number of times, had game activity wax and wane, and had
similar waxing and waning with specific technology. But writing and
document engineering is a perennial attraction. As part of a current
drive to reduce the number of "draft" articles (mostly unfinished game
sessions), it's a perfect time to get this out the door.
</p>
<p>
Significantly, in the last couple of years, Generative AI technology
enabled by the creation of Large Language Models is becoming nearly
ubiquitous in software engineering. This article leverages ChatGPT
and Cursor/Sonnet 3.5 for a number of reasons:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hooking up databases, of which a file system may also be
considered, is rapidly becoming a triviality. LLMs can solve
technical issues in seconds which might take me a few hours
of deep reading.</li>
  <li>There is still value in static data such as intended to present
in this article. Having backing database operating at run time is
overkill.</li>
  <li>While a runtime database is overkill, the file system can be
regarded as a database, whence the technical decisions around
data formatting matter.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, a static and archived instance of a SQLite3
database may also be a viable option. This database would only
be queried at build time, and would never ship to production.</li>
  <li>Haml is a very fine templating language which gets too little
attention. It's leveraged in this article to provide access to
the Ruby programming language which is used by the platform
(MiddlemanApp), necessary for processing the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>
As the initial version of this article is wrapped up, the
initial goal of leveraging static but mutable data for
creating static web pages is satisfied. The game data is
stored in completely separate files which are loaded and
processed at build time to provide game data when the page
renders. There is more which could be done, some of which
is noted in the article text.
</p>

<h2>Data processing a few Vietnam wargames</h2>
<p>
This is not my complete collection of Vietnam wargames nor an
exhaustive list of all the known games, and the listed descriptions
which follow are incomplete. It is, however, a proof
of concept for integrating YAML processing directly into a Haml
template.
</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Two aspects of design are relevant. First, how should the data be
designed to be accessible during build time? Second, how should
the data be processed and presented during build time?
Build time is when the data and the template are processed by the
engine, in this case, an appropriately configured Middleman App. The
engine first renders the Haml, then renders the markdown, with the
final output being HTML as displayed here.</p>
<h4>Data design</h4>
<p>
Among many choices for storing the game data, this project is
using Yaml. It's easy to read, store, and process. Given Yaml,
a decision has to be made whether to store all the games in a
single file, or each game in it's own file. There are pros and
cons for each.
</p>
<p>
However, there is a strong argument that having each game in its own file
reduces the cogitive load when the files need manual editing, or when a
new game is added. With a large single file, it's easier to create syntax
errors and induce annoying debugging. With multiple smaller files,
adding a new game is as easy as adding its relevant file. The tradeoff is
that opening many smaller files is a lot slower than opening a single file,
even when the file is large.
</p>
<p>
If multiple files ever becomes an issue, it's not that difficult to
concatenate all the individual files into a single file in some out-of-band
process. This provides a best of both worlds at the one time expense of
setting up the concatenation.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of whether the data is stored in a single file or
multiple files, Yaml is not the most efficent for data entry.
Dedicated data entry tools or spreadsheets are far more efficient.
For this tiny application, writing a dedicated tool is out of
scope, it would require a lot more web programming than warranted.
However, spreadsheets typically supply CSV exporting, for which
the CSV file can be loaded into a database, then Yaml emitted from
the database. As an alternate, CSV could have been used for this
project as well, but out of band reasons dictated Yaml. Generating
Yaml from a database could use either a single file or multiple
files.
</p>
<h4>Processor design</h4>
<p>
There is not much to document. For individual, game-specific file,
each are read then displayed.
</p>
<p>
Batch processing reads all the files at once, then iterates over
the collection of files to display the contents of each.
</p>
<p>
The intersting aspect of this is that the processing is being done
from Ruby code embedded in the text of the file. The reader doesn't
see the code, only what it outputs.
</p>
<h4>Individual file processing</h4>
<p>
The YAML formatted data for each game is loaded into a Ruby hash,
where each game is explicitly named in the processor. Here's example
of the hash: {"game"=&gt;{"title"=&gt;"Viet Nam", "published"=&gt;1965, "designer"=&gt;"Phil Orbanes", "publisher"=&gt;"Game Science", "comment"=&gt;"Given its initial publication in 1965, the game seems prescient to how the war eventually played out."}}.
</p>
<p>
The hash is dereferenced appropriately to display the game's
title, designer, etc. This is the standard stuff, the novelty
being in how it's done in the Middleman template. Also, presenting
each game requires duplicating markup. Each game has it's own explicit
section in the article, and that has to be explicitly defined. Here
are two of them:
</p>
<div class="indented">
<h5>
Viet Nam
</h5>
<p>
Published: 1965
</p>
<p>
Given its initial publication in 1965, the game seems prescient to how the war eventually played out.
</p>
</div>
<div class="indented">
<h5>
Indochine 1952: Opération "Bruno"
</h5>
<p>
published: 2013
</p>
</div>
<p>
Each of the games above was individually added to this file, a very
tedious process which nevetheless leverages having the game data
in an independent and parseable format.
</p>
<h4>Batched processing</h4>
<p>
Reading individual files is not difficult, but it is time consuming.
Each file has to be read by name into the processor (which is this
article) with the presentation duplicated for each file. A better
way is to read all the files at once and iterate over the collection.
This allows having a single, standard presentation, as demonstrated by
article-specific header styling.
</p>
<pre>require 'pathname'
games_dir = Pathname.new('data/indochina/games')
game_files = Dir.glob(games_dir.join('*.yaml'))
games = game_files.map { |file| YAML.load_file(file).with_indifferent_access }</pre>
<p>
Once the <code>games</code> are loaded, iteration over the
collection emitting formatted output. Standard stuff, really.
But always fun to build.
</p>
<div class="indented">
<h5 class="gametitle">
Bad Moon Rising
</h5>
<p>
Designer: Paul Rohrbaugh
</p>
<p>
Publisher: High Flying Dice Games
</p>
</div>
<div class="indented">
<h5 class="gametitle">
Indochine 1952: Opération "Bruno"
</h5>
<p>
Published: 2013
</p>
</div>
<div class="indented">
<h5 class="gametitle">
Viet Nam
</h5>
<p>
Published: 1965
</p>
<p>
Designer: Phil Orbanes
</p>
<p>
Publisher: Game Science
</p>
<p>
Comments: Given its initial publication in 1965, the game seems prescient to how the war eventually played out.
</p>
</div>
<hr />

<p>
And that's all there is to it. Adding a game is as simple as
adding another game file, everything else is automatic.
Future opportunity for batched processing includes both adding
more games, and further customizing the presentation. In particular,
hanging indentation might be a great way to help separate game-related
text from the article text proper.
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>From Cursor/Sonnet 3.5:</p>
<blockquote>
This document explores the technical implementation of content generation using
HAML and YAML, using Vietnam wargames as a practical example. It demonstrates the
evolution from manual, individual file processing to automated batch processing,
while examining the tradeoffs between different data storage approaches (single
vs multiple YAML files). The article serves as both a technical reference and a
practical demonstration of how to structure, process, and present data in a static
site generator context, with particular attention to the benefits and challenges
of each approach.
</blockquote>
<p>While it took over 9 years to ship this article, it was definitely worth
finishing and publishing. The techniques here are between completely static
text, and a fully database-driven application. As such, it retains flexibility
while remaining lightweight.</p>
<p>
At the time of publication, the article is generated from a MiddlemanApp
build, something which may change in the future.

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
