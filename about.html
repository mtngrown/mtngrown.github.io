            <h1 id="conflict-simulation">Conflict Simulation</h1>
            
            <p>Hey, are you sure you're in the right place?</p>
            
            <p>I hope so, because what we're doing here is exciting!</p>
            
            <p>See, the state of conflict simulation board gaming - wargaming - is
            both incredibly exciting, and stupendously behind the times.</p>
            
            <p>The exciting part is that people continue to play and develop old
            classics such as PanzerBlitz and Ogre. The cumulative amount of fan
            activity reaching back into the early 70s is truly inspiring.</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand, <em>none of it is well-curated!</em></p>
            
            <p>Everything is strewn about the web haphazardly. Sites which haven't been
            updated since the late 1990s, side by side with sites which are
            maintained, but look like they're stuck in the 1990s.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, the intellectual property situation for many titles is
            unclear, to put it politely. Some games, such as Ogre, have benefitted
            from active protection, and allowed the game designer to profitably
            reissue, and maintain some semblance of order with respect to the canon.</p>
            
            <p>Other games have not had such luck. In fact, some trademarks may be at
            risk (or already lost) due to negligence of the trademark holders.</p>
            
            <p>Can we, the fans and players do about this situation?</p>
            
            <p>Sure!</p>
            
            <p>But first, you're probably wondering who I am, so let's deal with that
            first.</p>
            
            <h2 id="who-is-mtngrown">Who is mtngrown?</h2>
            
            <p>Nobody.</p>
            
            <p>Yep, I'm a nobody, and everything here should be considered ill-informed
            opinion.</p>
            
            <p>I'm not a war gaming expert. In fact, up until late 2013, I hadn't
            played any board games (much less war games) at all in over 35 years.</p>
            
            <p>My primary motivation for writing this site is 95% personal. Writing
            helps me learn new and difficult concepts. Writing helps me remember
            things I would otherwise forget. Writing is fun for me, even if no one
            reads what I write.</p>
            
            <p>My secondary motivation, the remaining %5, is to encourage gamers in
            general, and war gamers specifically, to open source as much of their
            activity as feels reasonable. Or perhaps even a tiny bit more than what
            feels reasonableâ€¦push the comfort zone just a bit.</p>
            
            <p>To that end, and as explained below, everything I produce on the 
            site is open sourced under a liberal Creative Commons license.
            Material which is posted for convenience belongs to respective copyright
            holders.</p>
            
            <h2 id="taking-action">Taking action</h2>
            
            <p>First, always respect copyrights and trademarks. Nobody gets rich
            selling wargames, but respecting the owner of the IP allows continued
            development over time.</p>
            
            <p>Second, if you're publishing or promoting fan-derived works (this would
            be referred to a "fanfic" in literature), recognize that you do <em>not</em>
            own rights to the trademark without being specifically granted such
            rights. There would be lawyers involved.</p>
            
            <p>However, you <em>do</em> own copyright on your own work.</p>
            
            <p>And this is where it gets interesting.</p>
            
            <p>The vast amount of derived work on games is implicitly copyrighted All
            Rights Reserved, and often <em>explicitly</em> copyrighted All Rights Reserved.
            The derived works are usually disseminated in proprietry formats such as
            Microsoft Word or PDF, and images as low quality JPG or PNG.</p>
            
            <p>In other words, the work solely depends on the author, and with
            proprietary formats, related work has to be created completely
            from scratch.</p>
            
            <p>That changes here.</p>
            
            <p>Everything (excepting explicitely trademarked material) is given to you

            <p>Sometimes, you can't</p>
            
            <p>There is always objection from people who have invested in a
            community where the copyright or trademark holder refuses to develop or
            release, essentially holding a game hostage.</p>
            
            <p>Let them.</p>
            
            <p>They can't eat it, there are thousands of great games out there, and
            increasingly, game developers who would be delighted to have someone
            riff off their work to help grow a vibrant community.</p>
            
            <p>When a game is held hostage, it's their loss, not yours.</p>

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Something new: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last few years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something classic: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something again: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something Vietnam as I'm on a Vietnam binge.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air ware in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
              </p>
