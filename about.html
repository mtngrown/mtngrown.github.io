            <h1 id="conflict-simulation">Conflict Simulation</h1>
            
            <p>Hey, are you sure you're in the right place?</p>
            
            <p>I hope so, because what we're doing here is exciting!</p>
            
            <p>See, the state of conflict simulation board gaming - wargaming - is
            both incredibly exciting, and stupendously behind the times.</p>
            
            <p>The exciting part is that people continue to play and develop old
            classics such as PanzerBlitz and Ogre. The cumulative amount of fan
            activity reaching back into the early 70s is truly inspiring.</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand, <em>none of it is well-curated!</em></p>
            
            <p>Everything is strewn about the web haphazardly. Sites which haven't been
            updated since the late 1990s, side by side with sites which are
            maintained, but look like they're stuck in the 1990s.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, the intellectual property situation for many titles is
            unclear, to put it politely. Some games, such as Ogre, have benefitted
            from active protection, and allowed the game designer to profitably
            reissue, and maintain some semblance of order with respect to the canon.</p>
            
            <p>Other games have not had such luck. In fact, some trademarks may be at
            risk (or already lost) due to negligence of the trademark holders.</p>
            
            <p>Can we, the fans and players do about this situation?</p>
            
            <p>Sure!</p>
            
            <p>But first, you're probably wondering who I am, so let's deal with that
            first.</p>
            
            <h2 id="who-is-mtngrown">Who is mtngrown?</h2>
            
            <p>Nobody.</p>
            
            <p>Yep, I'm a nobody, and everything here should be considered ill-informed
            opinion.</p>
            
            <p>I'm not a war gaming expert. In fact, up until late 2013, I hadn't
            played any board games (much less war games) at all in over 35 years. </p>
            
            <p>My primary motivation for writing this site is 95% personal. Writing
            helps me learn new and difficult concepts. Writing helps me remember
            things I would otherwise forget. Writing is fun for me, even if no one
            reads what I write.</p>
            
            <p>My secondary motivation, the remaining %5, is to encourage gamers in
            general, and war gamers specifically, to open source as much of their
            activity as feels reasonable. Or perhaps even a tiny bit more than what
            feels reasonableâ€¦push the comfort zone just a bit.</p>
            
            <p>To that end, and as explained below, everything I produce on the 
            site is open sourced under a liberal Creative Commons license.
            Material which is posted for convenience belongs to respective copyright
            holders.</p>
            
            <h2 id="taking-action">Taking action</h2>
            
            <p>First, always respect copyrights and trademarks. Nobody gets rich
            selling wargames, but respecting the owner of the IP allows continued
            development over time.</p>
            
            <p>Second, if you're publishing or promoting fan-derived works (this would
            be referred to a "fanfic" in literature), recognize that you do <em>not</em>
            own rights to the trademark without being specifically granted such
            rights. There would be lawyers involved.</p>
            
            <p>However, you <em>do</em> own copyright on your own work.</p>
            
            <p>And this is where it gets interesting.</p>
            
            <p>The vast amount of derived work on games is implicitly copyrighted All
            Rights Reserved, and often <em>explicitly</em> copyrighted All Rights Reserved.
            The derived works are usually disseminated in proprietry formats such as
            Microsoft Word or PDF, and images as low quality JPG or PNG.</p>
            
            <p>In other words, the work solely depends on the author, and with
            proprietary formats, related work has to be created completely
            from scratch.</p>
            
            <p>That changes here.</p>
            
            <p>Everything (excepting explicitely trademarked material) is given to you

            <p>Sometimes, you can't</p>
            
            <p>There is always objection from people who have invested in a
            community where the copyright or trademark holder refuses to develop or
            release, essentially holding a game hostage.</p>
            
            <p>Let them.</p>
            
            <p>They can't eat it, there are thousands of great games out there, and
            increasingly, game developers who would be delighted to have someone
            riff off their work to help grow a vibrant community.</p>
            
            <p>When a game is held hostage, it's their loss, not yours.</p>

                  More PanzerBlitz. Situation 11 has not seen
                  any plays at all, and Situation 7 only a single solo play. Situations 10
                  and 12 have only been played FtF, without a detailed writeup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Arab Israeli Wars is coming!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
