<h1 id="conflict-simulation">Conflict Simulation</h1>

<p>Hey, are you sure you're in the right place?</p>

<p>I hope so, because what we're doing here is exciting!</p>

<p>See, the state of conflict simulation board gaming - wargaming - is
both incredibly exciting, and stupendously behind the times.</p>

<p>The exciting part is that people continue to play and develop old
classics such as PanzerBlitz and Ogre. The cumulative amount of fan
activity reaching back into the early 70s is truly inspiring.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <em>none of it is well-curated!</em></p>

<p>Everything is strewn about the web haphazardly. Sites which haven't been
updated since the late 1990s, side by side with sites which are
maintained, but look like they're stuck in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the intellectual property situation for many titles is
unclear, to put it politely. Some games, such as Ogre, have benefitted
from active protection, and allowed the game designer to profitably
reissue, and maintain some semblance of order with respect to the canon.</p>

<p>Other games have not had such luck. In fact, some trademarks may be at
risk (or already lost) due to negligence of the trademark holders.</p>

<p>Can we, the fans and players do about this situation?</p>

<p>Sure!</p>

<p>But first, you're probably wondering who I am, so let's deal with that
first.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-mtngrown">Who is mtngrown?</h2>

<p>Nobody.</p>

<p>Yep, I'm a nobody, and everything here should be considered ill-informed
opinion.</p>

<p>I'm not a war gaming expert. In fact, up until late 2013, I hadn't
played any board games (much less war games) at all in over 35 years.</p>

<p>My primary motivation for writing this site is 95% personal. Writing
helps me learn new and difficult concepts. Writing helps me remember
things I would otherwise forget. Writing is fun for me, even if no one
reads what I write.</p>

<p>My secondary motivation, the remaining %5, is to encourage gamers in
general, and war gamers specifically, to open source as much of their
activity as feels reasonable. Or perhaps even a tiny bit more than what
feels reasonableâ€¦push the comfort zone just a bit.</p>

<p>To that end, and as explained below, everything I produce on the 
site is open sourced under a liberal Creative Commons license.
Material which is posted for convenience belongs to respective copyright
holders.</p>

<h2 id="taking-action">Taking action</h2>

<p>First, always respect copyrights and trademarks. Nobody gets rich
selling wargames, but respecting the owner of the IP allows continued
development over time.</p>

<p>Second, if you're publishing or promoting fan-derived works (this would
be referred to a "fanfic" in literature), recognize that you do <em>not</em>
own rights to the trademark without being specifically granted such
rights. There would be lawyers involved.</p>

<p>However, you <em>do</em> own copyright on your own work.</p>

<p>And this is where it gets interesting.</p>

<p>The vast amount of derived work on games is implicitly copyrighted All
Rights Reserved, and often <em>explicitly</em> copyrighted All Rights Reserved.
The derived works are usually disseminated in proprietry formats such as
Microsoft Word or PDF, and images as low quality JPG or PNG.</p>

<p>In other words, the work solely depends on the author, and with
proprietary formats, related work has to be created completely
from scratch.</p>

<p>That changes here.</p>

<p>Everything (excepting explicitely trademarked material) is given to you
under a liberal Creative Commons license. The text is all Markdown with
Haml and CSS layout. The images, whereever possible, are SVG. You are
free to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fork this repository for yourself.</li>
  <li>Create new works based on the text and images in this repository.</li>
  <li>If you like, send a pull request and your contribution may be added,
as long as it meets the spirit and style of the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're not familiar with the Creative Commons, please visit:
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you can't</p>

<p>There is always objection from people who have invested in a
community where the copyright or trademark holder refuses to develop or
release, essentially holding a game hostage.</p>

<p>Let them.</p>

<p>They can't eat it, there are thousands of great games out there, and
increasingly, game developers who would be delighted to have someone
riff off their work to help grow a vibrant community.</p>

<p>When a game is held hostage, it's their loss, not yours.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
