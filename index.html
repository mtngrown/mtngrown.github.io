<p>After "winning" Game 24, I'm stoked to play more. I want to concentrate on getting
both VP and card draw out of the gate, with a bias towards card draw, and when
it makes sense, trade VP for military points.</p>

<p>Here's Game 25:</p>

<p>I'm really digging this game. It's becoming my usual way to unwind after work.
I'm also keeping track of scores on a spreadsheet, which is interesting as
I can track the score on each turn and get averages. For example, my average
score on Turn 4,...</p>

<p>Feeling motivated. This game plays so fast getting in several games
is very easy. Writing them up takes longer than playing. I should
probably play in sets of three games to make the writeups more efficient.</p>

<p>My usual opponent stopped by a bit later in the day to revisit
The Dunland Trap. We didn't have high expectations, but as it
turned out, we managed to get a win anyways. Gratifying. It's

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
