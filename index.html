                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking

                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
