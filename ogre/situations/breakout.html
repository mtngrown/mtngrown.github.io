            <h1 id="breakout">Breakout</h1>
            
            <p class="image-right"><img alt="CP Gamma logo" src="/images/ogre/cpgamma-icon.png" /></p>
            
            <p>Breakout is a GEV scenario for two or three players. A large combine
            force has already overrun a Paneuropean defense, and rather than mopping
            them up, is bypassing them in an attempt to cross a river. However, just
            as they arrive at its banks, the Paneuropean mobile reserve comes to the
            rescue.</p>
            
            <p>Its an interesting scenario because there are both raiding and frontal
            assault possiblities for both sides. Any side that plunders an enemy CP
            will have a huge advantage. If the Paneurpeans can manage a fighthing
            retreat they will be rewarded handsomely.</p>
            
            <h2 id="set-up">Set Up</h2>
            
            <p>Use the GEV map. Towns and bridges southeast of the big river are
            intact, including the river bridge (30 SP). All other towns and bridges
            are destroyed.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="Three player Breakout" src="/images/ogre/breakout.png" /></p>
            
            <p>If three players are available, then two play Paneurope, and one plays
            the Combine. The Paneuropean players may cooperate, but they take
            sepearate turns. The order of play goes:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Paneuropean remnants</li>
              <li>Combine</li>
              <li>Paneuropean reserves</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Players select force mixes in secret, and set them up behind screens.</p>
            
            <p>The Combine player gets twenty five armor, twenty five infantry, and CP
            Alpha (D2 M0). The armor and infantry may be set up anywhere except
            within six hexes of either Paneuropean start area. The CP must be at
            least four hexes from every board edge. NB: 25 armor = 150 VP = Ogre Mk
            V.</p>
            
            <p>The Paneuropean remnant player gets eight armor, fifteen squads of
            infantry, CP Alpha (D3 M0), and either one large or two small
            revetments. Heavy Weapons Infantry, Cruise Missile Crawlers, and Ogres
            are not available â€“ these guys have been in continuous bloody combat
            for three hours, and they've all been used up. Lasers and laser towers
            are available, at whatever rate ends up getting published, currently
            this seems to be 2 armor per 30 sp laser, and 3 per 20 sp tower. Place
            all these forces in the three city hexes at 0510-0409-0410.</p>
            
            <p>The Paneuropean reserve player gets seventeen armor placed on the
            southwestern island. Place CP Beta (D1 M0) in hex 2218 and a howitzer in
            2116. At the start of this player's second turn an additional four armor
                  units arrive into a map edge bordering this player's start area.
            These reinforcements may be borrowed against if an especially large Ogre
            is to be purchased, e.g. 20 armor buys a Fencer. Their entrance may not
            be delayed (exception: off map cruise missiles). Armor may be exchanged
            for infantry at the "book value" of 3 squads per armor unit.</p>
            
            <p>Both the Paneuropean reserve and Combine player are encouraged to buy
            any sort of unit, including Ogres, off board cruise missiles, engineers,
            revetments, militia, lasers, etcetera. Additionally, there are no limits
            on unit types. If the Combine player wants to take exclusively
            superheavies, then he may.</p>
            
            <h2 id="special-rules">Special Rules</h2>
            
            <p>All HQs are tactical HQs. In addition to being worth victory points,
            destroying a side's HQ causes chaos throughout that side's forces.
            Following the loss of a HQ, that side loses their entire next turn,
            including the undisable phase.</p>
            
            <p>The GEV rubble rule must be used. Otherwise the Paneuropean remnants may
            be impossible to dig out.</p>
            
            <h2 id="escape">Escape</h2>
            
            <p>Paneuropean units may escape off of the southwestern island's edge.
            Combine units may escape off the north side.</p>
            
            <h2 id="ending-the-game">Ending the Game</h2>
            
            <p>The game ends when either all Combine or Paneuropean units have been
            destroyed.</p>
            
            <h2 id="objectives-and-victory-points">Objectives and Victory Points</h2>
            
            <p>The Combine objective is to defeat the Paneuropeans in detail, and get
            across the river. That player scores normal VP for destroying enemy
            units. If his units can get across to the island to the east of the
            river, he scores the unit's value for having those units there, If the
            bridge is up, VP scored in this way are tripled.</p>
            
            <p>The Paneuropean remnant's troops are in line for medals and citations,
            if only they can keep them alive long enough to collect them pre-mortem.
            He gets normal VP for destroying enemy units, and VP equal to unit value
            for each of his units which escapes or survives.</p>
            
            <p>The Paneuropean reserve's goal is to stop, or better yet anihilate, the
            Combine forces. Score normal VP for unit destruction.</p>
            
            <p>Each command post destroyed scores 20 VP for the destroyer.</p>
            
            <p>Add the two Paneuropean point totals together, and compare against the
            Combine point total to determine victory: One side ahead 75 or more:
            descisive victory; ahead 25 or more: marginal victory; less than that:
            it's a draw.</p>
            
            <h2 id="strategy-tips">Strategy Tips</h2>
            
            <p>If cruise missiles or GEVs are afoot, keep something back to gaurd your
            headquarters.</p>
            
            <p>The remnant player can't win against a determined Combine assault, but
            he can usually destroy a class of enemy units in furthering some general
            strategy, Ideas include destroying GEVs and let the reservist goin HQ
            raiding, or destroy superheavies, blow the bridge, and laugh.</p>
