            <h1 id="situation-3---game-2">Situation #3 - Game 2</h1>
            
            <p>January 26, 2014</p>
            
            <p>Revisiting Situation #3 for the third time, second time solo.</p>
            
            <p>Russians set up first, and this time, more units are loaded on trucks
            and wagons, "in reserve" and ready to move where needed.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
            
            <p>Germans roll a 1 (randomizing for solitaire game) on the dice, hence,
            must force an exit through Board 1.</p>
            
            <p>Russians start to move East. Trucks and wagons rolling. Hopefully, the
            Germans don't have enough movement to feint.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
            
            <p>Germans are going for fast engagement with Panzers. Mortars and
            Howitzers are set up for covering fire. Infantry is set to engage on the
            road lading up to the pass between Hills 104 and 126.</p>
            
            <p>Russians are massing infantry forces at the footof 104.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
            
            <p>Germans claimed a Russian truck on the fire round, then split forces to
            escape the infantry massing up and go after some field guns.</p>
            
            <p>Russians really boxing in the Germans.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>
            
            <p>Germans got a couple of dispersals, remembered to add 1 to die roll when
            defender in forest, which cost a kill.</p>
            
            <p>Russians, they might be in trouble! The Germans are pressing very hard
            in the Adski sector.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>
            
            <p>Germans finally, for the first time in several games it feels like, are
            getting some slack: good die rolls! This turn sees Russian 82 mm mortar
            and another truck destroyed, and a 76. 2 mm ATG dispersed. Even better,
            one of the PzKw III Gs caught a stack of Russian transport in the clear
            and overran. This cost the Russians an ATG and a rifle company.</p>
            
            <p>Russians really whiffing on the dice. With the panzers loose at the
            north end of the board, transport just got really dicey.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>
            
            <p>Germans are in position, the next two turns will decide it. The Russians
            could get very lucky on clse assaults and keep the Germans dispersed
            till the clock runs out.</p>
            
            <p>Russians couldn't do a whole lot here, try to mass infantry to not get
            taken out completely. They did get a German truck.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>
            
            <p>Germans In pretty good shape, with the Russians not being able to roll
            enough kills or dispersals to prevent the Germans from either moving or
            firing.</p>
            
            <p>Russians have a few bad options, and one good fire target of a PzKw III
            G down in a gully which is going after the remaining ATG gun which is a
            threat, except, whoops, that unit is dispersed! But, the Germans
            blundered and thought they were driving Panzer IVs, and got their IIIs
            into bad positions… And dispersed!</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h2>
            
            <p>Germans mostly positioning, took out another wagon, still can't manage
            to take out the ATG gun.</p>
            
            <p>Russian ATG gets another truck, disperses tracks on the slope.</p>
            
            <p>Looking like a draw, as the Germans just don't have enough fire power to
            reduce the infantry.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h2>
            
            <p>Germans finally took out the ATG, everything positioned for one massive
            fire round.</p>
            
            <p>Russians dispersed a couple of big stacks, really helped because this
            the Germans last turn.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h2>
            
            <p>Germans fail to dislodge rifle company in Adski, rolling a 5 at 3:1.</p>
            
            <p>Russians again rolled well and dispersed.</p>
            
            <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
            
            <p>Draw, possibly favoring the Germans as the Germans would probably get a
            win given 2-3 more turns, possibly even a single turn more. The Russian
            infantry is just too strong.</p>
            
            <p>Lightweight artillery, H and M weapones with AF 2 or 3 is super useful
            for destroying transport, especially if it's loaded transport! The trick
            is catching it in the clear.</p>
            
            <h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>
            
            <p>Germans stacked two ATGs in the same hex, making it impossible to get
            the transport in to pick it both up the same turn.</p>
            
            <p>Russians lost all their trucks by Turn #5.</p>
            
            <p>Germans put their ATG guns at extreme risk, by allowing Russian SMG unit
            to get too close. If the Germans load, the gun is lost on a CAT.</p>
            
            <p>Artillery in forest hexes also needs to be stacked with infantry, if
            there is no chance for that unit to move. This would have saved at least
            two Russian field guns.</p>
            
            <p>Germans forgetting to run selective fire on Russian infantry, could have
            taken out a unit or two, possibly.</p>
            
            <p>I think I have not been halving AF for attackers firing on inputs on
            slopes when the attacker is on a hilltop or otherslope. I think this
            wrong.</p>
            
            <h3 id="handicapping-and-rebalancing">Handicapping and rebalancing</h3>
            
            <p>Allow reinforcements on successive turns for the Germans, both armor and
            infantry.</p>
            
            <p>Assuming the Situation can be rebalanced appropriately, require wider
            hexes from the east and west boundaries, east boundary at Adski in
            particular. This limits artificial boundary effect.</p>
            
            <p>Disallow the swamp on board 1 to count for cleared hexes. Armor can't
            move through it.</p>
            
            <p>Reduce the Russian unit count by two or three infantry units, say three
            rifle, or remove both guards, two SMG, or remove a guard and an SMG.</p>

              <p>Avalon Hill's PanzerBlitz was a successor to a game called
              "Tactical Game 3," which was never developed for market. The story can
              be found on related web sites. What's important here is that the game
              does have a long and successful history, ultimately selling hundreds
              of thousands of copies.</p>
              <h3 id="panzerblitz-links">PanzerBlitz links</h3>
              
              <p>Here are a few of the best links about PanzerBlitz available on the web.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><a href="http://www.imaginative-strategist.layfigures.com/">Imaginative
              Strategist</a>,
              often referred to as "ImStrat" has an incredible collection of articles,
              counters, maps and other material related to PanzerBlitz, Panzer Leader
              and the Arab Israeli games. Seriously, ImStrat is worth hours of time.</p>

                <li>
                  <p><a href="http://gregpanzerblitz.com/">Greg's PanzerBlitz Site</a> is another
              outstanding resource, also worth hours of reading.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.ee6d608">ConSim World Forum</a>
              appears to be where a number of current PanzerBlitz players can be
              found. The forum is relatively relaxed and low traffic, but there is a
              lot of information available.</p>
