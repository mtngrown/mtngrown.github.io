<h1 id="situation-6-game-2-german-mobile-defense-west-of-dnieper-bend">Situation #6 (game 2): German mobile defense west of Dnieper Bend</h1>

<p>May 31, 2014</p>

<p>At Endgame, had a tentative meetup with Al S. but I haven't heard from
him. Hence, setting up Situation #6 for a second solo play.</p>

<p>In the first Situation #6 game, the Germans forgot to bring their
halftracks. This game, the Germans have the correct OOB.</p>

<p>House rule: halftrack elimination does not produce a wreck counter. As
will be noted in the After Action, this is actually a blunder with
respect to the rules, which clearly state that destroyed halftracks
result in a wreck counter placed at the site of destruction.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>The first game of Situation #6 I did not understand why it might be
benficial for the Germans to set up second, but move first. I get it
now.</p>

<p>Germans first move is to get some infantry over to the pass between
hills 104  &amp; 126 to deny the Russians theroad movement through the pass.</p>

<p>Russians can't do much more than road march into the teeth of the much
smaller German force, which is hoding some tactically valuable
positions.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>Germans consolidating positions around the pass.</p>

<p>Russians made a mistake by putting all the truck-mounted SMG units at
the rear. A few of these should be up at the front to spot, close
assault, and soak up fire without producing wrecks.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>Germans took out a field gun which the Russians probably didn't need to
sacrifice. It was placed to put some pressure om the Jgpz IV.</p>

<p>Russians are going to have to really put some pressure on now, because
they are bottleneck on Board 1 in a big way. Attempting to encircle the
Germans.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>Germans mounting up to pull back.</p>

<p>Russians encircled units on pass.</p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>Germans in major retreat!</p>

<p>Al S. showed up about right here, so I played everything out solo,
narrating my reasoning to Al as I went.</p>

<h2 id="turn-6---turn-10">Turn 6 - Turn 10</h2>

<p>Looks pretty close, will have to count pieces to see if the Germans have
enough to squeak out a marginal victory and claim a draw.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>Final result: Russians take 7 German units, Germans take 15 Russian
units, marginal victory for Germans. Russian move 11 units on to Board
3, marginal Russian victory. Hence, a draw.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<p>Not using halftracks as sacrificial pieces to slow Russian advance. I've
playing that halftrack elimination does not place a wreck, which is
counter to the rules. Using halftracks as wrecks allows saving the
"real" AFVs for shooting.</p>

<p>Germans still don't know how to employ the long range artillery. The
Wespe and Hummel got off one shot each.</p>

<h3 id="balance">Balance</h3>

<p>Situation #6 as played in these two games feels relatively
well-balanced. On the one hand, it's tough for the Germans to get the
long range SPA effectively employed, and difficult to acquire other
kills, on the other hand, with a bit of care, the Germans can generally
stay well out of reach from the Russians, choosing when and where to
sacrifice units.</p>

<p>But the Russians have so many units, which puts a lot of pressure on the
Germans. Any German standing to fight risks being swarmed by T-34s.</p>

<p>It wasn't apparent the first game why the Germans need to get first
move. Since they're limited to Board 2 for set up, this move lets the
Germans quickly emplace to slow the Russians from leaving Board 1.
The Germans probably don't <em>need</em> to move first, but they <em>do</em> need to
make the Russians pay to leave Board 1, which means moving towards the
advancing Russian column immediately.</p>

<p>There is an official variant of this scenario distributed by Avalon Hill
in some printings of the game which allow the Germans to place a mines
and blocks. This could make it very, very difficult for the Russians to
win, depending on the skill of the German player to emplace the
impediments.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-panzerblitz">A brief history of PanzerBlitz</h3>

<p>Avalon Hill's PanzerBlitz was a successor to a game called
"Tactical Game 3," which was never developed for market. The story can
be found on related web sites. What's important here is that the game
does have a long and successful history, ultimately selling hundreds
of thousands of copies.</p>

<h3 id="panzerblitz-links">PanzerBlitz links</h3>

<p>Here are a few of the best links about PanzerBlitz available on the web.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.imaginative-strategist.layfigures.com/">Imaginative
Strategist</a>,
often referred to as "ImStrat" has an incredible collection of articles,
counters, maps and other material related to PanzerBlitz, Panzer Leader
and the Arab Israeli games. Seriously, ImStrat is worth hours of time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://gregpanzerblitz.com/">Greg's PanzerBlitz Site</a> is another
outstanding resource, also worth hours of reading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.ee6d608">ConSim World Forum</a>
appears to be where a number of current PanzerBlitz players can be
found. The forum is relatively relaxed and low traffic, but there is a
lot of information available.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are several more outstanding links which will be added in the
future, and if you, the reader, find one of your favorite sites missing,
please issue a <a href="https://github.com/mtngrown/consim/pulls">pull request</a>
with the relevant addition.</p>
