            <p>The notorious Situation #7. Among Long time players, this situation is
            held to be a slam dunk for a competent German player.</p>
            
            <p>Number of Russian counters: 50</p>
            
            <p>Number of German counters: 32</p>
            
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>One of the dangers of doing background research for game play
            preparation is that it may unwittingly introduce bias into one's
            perception. In this case, reading about Situation #7's lopsidedness has
            predisposed a certain lack of interest on my part.</p>
            
            <p>While it would be nice to annotate every turn, and that is something of
            a goal with respect to the series of games I'm playing, in this case, I
            may decide just to play out the scenario without worrying over much
            about taking notes. It's more important to have fun playing than to
            worry about anything. Worry defeats the whole purpose!</p>
            
            <p>Let's see what happens.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
            
            <p>Germans move first, splitting into three groups, north, central and
            south. This is a race to get optimum positioning on Board 2, then dig in
            and punish the Russians trying to dislodge the Germans from positions. A
            Panther from the central group reaches Bednost, with the rest of the
            central group in road march order towards Opustochenia. Most of the
            units in the northern and southern groups ended up in the clear,
            unavoidable, but not within range of Russian units.</p>
            
            <p>Ok, this really is going to suck for the Russians. The Germans can at
            least some units on Board 2 the first turn, the Russians cannot. The
            farthest they can get is almost to the edge of Board 2, having to move
            through adverse terrain.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
            
            <p>Germans move to fully occupy Bednost and Golod, with a very small
            presence at the south end of the map.</p>
            
            <p>Russians coming in large force at south end and north end, considering
            leaving Bednost alone.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
            
            <p>Germans have to make a decision here, because they win by default having
            as many units on the board as the Russians. So they need do no more than
            defend what they have. However, the more Russian units they can prevent
            from getting on Board 2, the better their victory.</p>
            
            <p>First up, Germans disperse T-34s on north slope of Hill 132. Next,
            reposition to establish dominant fields of fire on most of Board 2. The
            Russians are now forced to be very aggressive, but cannot risk losing
            too many units.</p>
            
            <p>If the Russians can push the Germans off Board 2, this also counts for
            victory conditions. However, the German's last move positioned the Wespe
            to cover the open ground on the north end of Board 2. This is going cost
            at least the dispersed T-34.</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand, a German Panther foolishly exposed itself to an
            overrun by a pair of T-34s, which landed behind a brown slope bar, hence
            concealed from fire this turn. First kill to Russians.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>
            
            <p>And the Germans get kill on T-34 which was dispersed last turn. Not much
            else to do other than make small positioning moves to adjust fields of
            fire and deny movement to Russians.</p>
            
            <p>Russians have got to move the infantry up fast, to get the Germans
            spotted and keep them off balance an in motion preferably off of Board
            2. End result of this turn is putting pressure on Hill 129.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>
            
            <p>Germans are facing trouble on Hill 129. They can can stay and fight, and
            reduce the size of the Russian force, at some cost to themselves, or
            they can cede to a more defensible position at the expense of losing a
            120 mm mortar, and positioning. Best to cede the hill, maintain winning
            conditions.</p>
            
            <p>Russians eliminated the German 120 mm mortar, as expected.  Then more
            positioning. The clock is running out. This is a hard scenario.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>
            
            <p>At some point the Russians will have to force a massive attack. The key
            for the Germans is making that as expensive as possible. At this point,
            since the Germans occupy the key real estate, there is liitle they can
            do other than make Russian attacks very expensive, and reposition to
            deny Russian fire advantage.</p>
            
            <p>Russians having spotted to fire on, and there are no Germans in the
            clear. Time to get busy.</p>
            
            <p>So, yeah, it's unrealistic, but for purposes of game play, T-34s really
            need that extra speediness to get around the battlefield. The idea is to
            try and force the Germans off of Hill 132 or out of Golod by end of
            game, leaving enough unit down south of Bednost to keep the Germans
            bottled up.</p>
            
            <p>It's interesting that Germans move relatively few pieces, while the
            Russians tend to move most of their units.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>
            
            <p>The Germans can't do much more than sit tight and wait for the
            inevitable onslaught Russians.</p>
            
            <p>First, rectify a major blunder: tanks in woods on Hill 132 should have
            fired on T-34s on south slope of Hill 129 several turns ago. It was a
            Russian blunder to leave these exposed! Since theT-34 is on a hill, it's
            1:2, roll 1, dispersed. Now move a Panther into position to combine
            attacks next turn for a kill.</p>
            
            <p>Since the Germans are going to take casualties, the tactics now serve to
            limit casualties to low attack strength units such as halftracks,
            emplaced to deny Russian post-attack advantage. That is, the Russians
            will eliminate those units, but, hopefully, gain no further tactical
            advantage.</p>
            
            <p>Russians are set up to first get pounded, then blast the Germans back
            big time. It just occurred to me, though, the German only need go for
            dispersals, but theRussians need kills. This is a Big Deal for game
            play. In any case, after a nasty roll 6 on a 4:1 (defending halftrack in
            forest), Russians managed to collect a few more halftacks which the
            Germans put out to deny terrain.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h2>
            
            <p>Germans whiffed a 3:1, T-34 in woods hilltop. Now, the decision is
            either stay and fight and probably lose the Wespe, or run and hide.</p>
            
            <p>This round, run; consolidate positions on Hill 132 and Golod. Give up
            Hill 129.</p>
            
            <p>Russians knock ATG in woods south of Golod, as expected. Also knocked
            off an SG III-75 with CAT which was a blunder on the Germans. Another
            CAT got a dispersal, which is going to be a kill next turn.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h2>
            
            <p>Germans need to knock off a couple of Russian units, else they're going
            to lose. So, two trucks eliminated, which will hurt the Russian count.</p>
            
            <p>Russians take out a tank and a half track, then make the huge move to
            surround Golod.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h2>
            
            <p>Here's the situation at the top of the Turn 10:</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="Top of Turn 10" src="/images/top-of-10th.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>This illustrates the essential difficulty of Situation #7: the Germans
            don't really need to do anything except avoid fighting.</p>
            
            <p>Because this was a solitaire game, I decided that the Germans would stay
            and fight instead of running around the north end of the Russian units.</p>
            
            <p>Germans whiffed a 3:1, which will be costly as it leaves Golod fully
            spotted, but did follow up a 2:1 dispersal with a 1:3 CAT for a kill.
            And, Lo! A Panther from Hill 132 disables the T-34 spotting, leaving
            only the east part of Golod spotted.</p>
            
            <p>Russians got some big kills including the Hummel on this last turn
            as a couple of rifle companies made a close assualt on the south side of
            Bednost. This was a total German blunder and didn't need to happen.</p>
            
            <p>A definite Russian blunder in deploying spotting units left the west
            half of Golod unspotted, leaving a three stack of Germans at 4:1 covered
            from fire.  Bummer for Russians. However, the units in the east side of
            Golod were eliminated.</p>
            
            <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
            
            <p>Final count: Germans 17, Russians 46, which is a marginal Russian
            victory. To be fair, the Germans probably lost 3-4 units by choosing to
            stay and fight rather than bailing out, and they definitely missed a few
            critically important opportunities for for fire, which would have
            knocked the Russians back 2-3 units, at least. In short, this felt
            well-balanced to me, but that's probably because I don't have much
            experience.</p>
            
            <p>After this first game, my impression is that this is the most
            "chess-like" situation yet. At the end of turn 6, The Russians were down
            only one unit, the Germans two, and losses for both sides were
            definitely blunders. Of particular note, the Germans ultimately had to
            cede ground to stay out of nasty attrition firefights.</p>
            
            <p>A tactic which occurred to me is how to force the Germans into nasty
            close combat situations by forcing them to either stay spotted by cheap
            deadly ATG guns, or feel compelled to overrun into the clear.</p>
            
            <p>This is where combat rule forcing the attack on the weakest unit can
            also be employed.</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand, the Germans could use more indirect fire by placing
            the Wespe and Hummel way off Board 2. They might not end up counting for
            victory, but it might not matter.</p>
            
            <p>Here's a good tactic: when faced with a large choice of potential
            targets, position such that a dispersal shot on one turn allows
            repositioning friendly units to fire for a kill on the next.</p>
            
            <h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>
            
            <p>German left a Panther exposed to overrun, which was completely
            unnecessary.</p>
            
            <p>Violated Russian stacking conditions on a truck/infantry colocation:
            there was already a unit in that hex.</p>
            
            <p>Russians not  using either infantry or SU-152s effectively. They need to
            come up the middle road on Board 1 at the start, movement 7 just gets
            them bogged down in the hills and swamps anywhere else.</p>
            
            <p>SG III-75 in woods on Hill 132 should have fired on T-34s on south slope
            of Hill 129 several turns ago. It was a Russian blunder to leave these
            exposed! Then again, at that range with the T-34 on a slope, it's 1:2
            attack for the Germans.</p>
            
            <p>German movement to deny terrain has to be balanced against whether the
            unit will survive. If it won't survive, then there has to be value in
            having the attacking unit firing instead of moving.</p>
            
            <p>Germans left the Wespe out of LOS on final turn, bad move. This could
            have taken out a Russian tank.</p>
            
            <p>Leaving Hummel exposed to CAT on last turn!</p>
            
            <h3 id="balance">Balance</h3>
            
            <p>One way to investigate a better balanced scenario would be to have the
            Russians come in from the east and the Germans from the west, opposite
            of the current scenario.</p>
            
            <p>Alternatively, specify the Russians as having first movement.</p>
            
            <p>By the start of Russian Turn 3, it's looking really grim for the
            Russians, specifically, facing a concealed Wespe on Hill 129 makes
            motion on the north end of Board 3 really problematic.</p>
            
            <p>It might be that having more than 10 turns helps even things out as
            well.</p>
            
            <p>Another way might be to add a few units to the Russian OOB, or remove a
            couple from the German, or both.</p>
            
            <h3 id="victory-conditions">Victory conditions</h3>
            
            <p>The game starts with a de facto German victory, since the Germans start
            with at least as many pieces as the Russians.</p>
            
            <p>The scenario is designed to force Russian offensive action. The Russians
            cannot win this with the usual tactic of emplacing unkillable infantry
            to block German action.</p>
            
            <p>One way to make victory conditions a little more interesting is to
            require the Germans to hold some real estate. The Germans were able to
            minimize losses up until they decided to fight, which lost them the
            game. A better balanced scenario might have a few less Russian tanks,
            with a requirement that the Germans must hold one or more towns or
            hills. (This opinion is based on one game, where neither Wespe or Hummel
            got into play.)</p>

              <p>Avalon Hill's PanzerBlitz was a successor to a game called

              be found on related web sites. What's important here is that the game
