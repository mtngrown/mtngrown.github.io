            <h1 id="situation-8-russian-organized-defense-german-relief-on-the-korsun-pocket">Situation #8 Russian Organized Defense: German Relief on the Korsun Pocket</h1>
            
            <p>This is solitaire game 1 for Situation #8. I've played it once before
            with an experienced wargamer who hadn't played PanzerBlitz in decades,
            and his Russians smoked my Germans pretty bad.</p>
            
            <p>Setting up for this game, now that I have the time, it's making me
            wonder how he was able to get all those heavy mortar shots off, given
            the 4 hex spotting for Russian command post, for the 120 mm mortars
            only. I seem to recall him spotting out much longer ranges, and spotting
            for the heavy howitzer as well. This would make a huge difference in
            game play, and would certainly go a long way towards explaining why the
            Germans never even got halfway across board one in 8 turns, much less
            off Board 3 in 10 turns.</p>
            
            <p>Of course, it didn't help that my opponent got <em>very</em> lucky on a die
            roll and took out a stack of AFVs which I negligently left exposed.
            That and a CAT taking out a stack of PzKpfw IVs in a later turn
            (but that was a calculated risk, which I lost.)</p>
            
            <p>Hopefully, in this solo game, I'll be able to figure out what went wrong
            in that game. Or not.</p>
            
            <h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>
            
            <p>The Russians set up first on Board 1. The strategy is to make it hard
            for the Germans to even get on the board using mines and blocks, then
            once they're on the board, hammer them with the artillery concealed on
            hill tops, while moving the guards and rifle units along the road to
            assume blocking positions if and when the Germans break through.</p>
            
            <p>The Germans have to pick what they think will be the softest point of
            the Russian defensive line, and hammer on it very hard.</p>
            
            <h3 id="scenario-specific-rules-for-indirect-fire">Scenario specific rules for indirect fire</h3>
            
            <p>The situation description states that Russian "CP's may only spot for
            120mm mortar (within 4 hexes.)" For this game, the assumption will be
            that the CP needs to be within 4 hexes of the mortar it calls fire for,
            but otherwise may call for fire on anything spotted in the CP's line of
            sight. CPs may call for fire more than once each turn. For example, if
            there are three mortars and two CPs, one of the CPs may call for fire
            for two mortars.</p>
            
            <p>This is a hole in the rules, and should probably be addressed by either 1.
            limiting call for fire onto a single target per (6 minute) turn, or 2.
            adding a clause to indirect fire rules increasing the amount of drift
            on each target when a CP is calling fire on more than one target.</p>
            
            <p>German indirect fire will follow optional indirect fire rules
            as defined in \S 10.1.</p>
            
            <h3 id="initial-position">Initial position</h3>
            
            <p>Here's the eagle eye view:</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="Initial positions for Situation #8" src="/images/pb_situation_8_setup.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>The image is muddy due to low light and iPhone camera, but the basic
            elements are clear.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The Germans place 1 CP forward, to direct fire on the Russian rifle,
            with infantry to follow with CAT if necessary. The engineers will move
            forward to take out the mines in the ford.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>German transport is staged in a rear area until enough cover is
            cleared to allow mounting and transport. This is primarily trucks, the
            halftracks forming a vanguard to rapidly get the infantry into spotting
            positions.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Russian infantry are deployed along the road to Uschas. While infantry
            is ordinarily slow with 1 MF unmounted, road bonus grants 2 MF. This may
            not seem like much, but when you're a German, and you're stuck in a
            gully and dispersed between Hills 135 and 123, 2 MF/turn is
            distressingly fast. These units are far enough west to stay in play no
            matter where the Germans attempt to force through.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Detailed photos and explanations follow.</p>
            
            <p>Note: There is a small but possibly significant error in this setup. The
            scenario calls for six (6) block counters, but I mistakenly deployed
            seven (7). This probably doesn't matter all <em>that</em> much, but it could
            mean the difference of getting three or four more German units across
            Board 1.</p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <p>The north end of the map is fairly well sealed off, as most of the clear
            terrain can be covered with the heavy mortars, the pesky swamp funnels
            enemy vehicles into the maw of the howitzer lurking in Uschas.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_north.jpg" /></p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <p>Close up of the units deployed around Uschas. This terrain is very
            difficult for vehicles, so the Russians feel comfortable with a nominal
            force to delay while reserve units move up along the western road
            towards Uschas.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_uschas.jpg" /></p>

            <p>The Russians are relying on terrain to discourage German crossing north
            of Hill 135. The gullies cost trucks 5 MF to exit, which adds a turn to
            cross the board compared to crossing the hills to the south.</p>

            <p>The Russians have made another blunder here by not putting at least one
            Rifle or Guards company in the middle forest. An infantry unit here
            would be exceedingly difficult for the Germans to kill, as lines of
            sight are very poor, and most good observation points are well covered
            by the mortars on Hill 135. However, the infantry units deployed along
            the Uschas road will move to seal off rear areas.</p>
            
            <p>The Germans are going to attempt to outflank the Russians using armor to
            swing around the north of Hill 135. Getting AFVs in the Russian rear
            would be positively pestilential to Russian plans.</p>

            <p>Guards and Submachine gun companies in reserve on western road,
            positioned to support Uschas if necessary. The mortars will harass
            transports attempting to exit across the clear terrain on board 3.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_hill130.jpg" /></p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <p>The Russian infantry reserve is lined up under cover along the western
            road loading north to Uschas. The mortars and command posts establish
            fields of fire covering most of boards 1 and 3. These need to be
            protected.</p>
            
            <p>The Russian mortar companies have an MF of 1. These companies deployed
            on the west have an option to quickly (3 turns) take the road to
            Opustchenia, where they can harass German transports striking out onto
            board 3. While they are almost certain to be lost, just having them in
            Opustchenia should cost the Germans 1 or 2 units, and possibly a full
            turn of movement to exit.</p>
            
            <p>The SU-85 are in reserve to (hopefully) counteract blatant attempts by
            the Germans to drive armor directly to the Russian rear.</p>
            
            <p>In all, west of Hill 135 is the middle of the fighting area. Units
            deployed here are protected from emplaced German mortars on the Bednost
            mesa, and can move north or south as the situation dictates.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_hill135.jpg" /></p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <p>German infantry and engineers mass at the eastern ford to eliminate
            potential spotting units and remove the mine from the ford.</p>
            
            <p>Armor and infantry will exploit a hole in the Russian line at 1E3 to
            move some infantry in on the ATG at the crossroads.</p>
            
            <p>The ramifications of this is that the ATG at the crossroad is at high
            risk. The Russian recon unit, which is basically doing nothing at 1E4,
            should have been stacked with the ATG at 1J5. On the other hand, the
            Russians can move a rifle company to stack with it.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_middle.jpg" /></p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <p>The Russians provide a slightly more than nominal force at Adski, in
            part to slow the Germans down if necessary, and the mortar to harass any
            transports caught out in the open on board 3 as the Germans attempt to
            escape.</p>
            
            <p>Note: the German setup changed after this photo was taken. All the other
            photos have the German positions as was actually played.</p>

            <p>Below, you can see the Germans getting ready to exploit a hole in the
            Russian line at hex 1E3, which will put the Germans on the road, in
            cover and unspotted, hence protected against the mortars on Hill 135.</p>

            <p>Creating all these photos is time consuming, but it's really handy to
            have a record for future reference.
            At some point, I'll start using VASSAL. Currently, it puts too much of
            a load on my system to be comfortable to use.</p>
            
            <p>Situation #8 is set up, let's play PanzerBlitz.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
            
            <p>Germans move first, and will swing around to the south to
            1. open a lane for the trucks to get through, and 2. cut off
            infantry reinforcements moving north.</p>
            
            <p>Here's the end of the German phase:</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/pb_g_1.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>And already I'm breaking or at least bending the rules by
            having stacked armor on the road in the forest. Stacking
            on roads is fine as long as the surrounding terrain costs
            are paid for movement. In this case, the surrounding terrain
            is "impassable" due to solid green hex sides.</p>
            
            <p>I think I'm going to disallow this in the future, along with
            writing up a rules summary with examples.</p>
            
            <p>Here's the end of the Russian phase:</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/pb_r_1.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>And that's it for Turn 1.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
            
            <p>And once again, the Germans are in a bind because they can't call for
            fire to handle the Russian infantry. Neither of the CPs are in LOS of
            anything useful, and it's going to take several turns to get them moved
            and emplaced somewhere safe.</p>
            
            <p>Fire results were disappointing, the fortification yeilded a No Effect.
            The die rolled 5, which would have been a 6 accounting for forested
            terrain, which would have been nothing even at 3:1 instead of 2:1 odds.</p>
            
            <p>Basically, in addition to the infantry, these 8 fortifications,
            emplaced on forested hilltops, are pretty much invulnerable.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_g_2.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>The Russians have to kill German units to win, though, and the Germans
            can make that pretty hard. So far, the best the Russians are doing is
            dispersing, which isn't going to be enough.</p>
            
            <p>The Germans could probably play hide-and-seek with the infantry and CPs,
            and get the armor off the board for a win. Would be tough to get any of
            the infantry off now, since it's all dismounted.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_r_2.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>On to Turn 3.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
            
            <p>Germans a few potshots, nothing exciting happened other than the mine
            finally cleared, which allowed the Germans to bring up a CP. This is
            going to be really useful. Necessary in fact.</p>
            
            <p>Didn't record fire for this turn. Having failed a 4:1 on a Russian rifle
            company in the forest was really disappointing. That unit it clogging up
            the works. The Germans have to go back and forth between keeping an
            advance, versus clearing out the rear area to allow transport to move
            forward.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_g_t3.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>The Russians now have a lot of targets. In fact, to Germans great
            chagrin, all 3 mortars can fire on a stack of German infantry at 3:1
            odds, which is 2/6 chance of outright kill, and another 2/6 chance of
            getting a dispersal. With a kill, the rifle company can advance to
            close assault the Wespe.</p>
            
            <p>Once again, I am have severe difficulties employing the German SPA
            effectively.</p>
            
            <p>First up the long range mortars to support the units guarding the
            intersection. I made a huge blunder here as the Russian by combining
            my fire for a single roll at 3:1 when I could have had 3 rolls at 3:1
            with 1/3 chance of eliminating on each roll. Of course, the combined
            attack gave 1/3 chance of eliminating the whole stack, which would have
            allowed the Russian infantry to advance up the lane. Had it succeeded,
            as noted above, this could have been a game-breaker for the Germans.
            By failing, it's probably not a game breaker for the Russians, but it
            won't make it any easier to halt the Germans.</p>

            <p>Much more fire and close assaulting occurred. The new record sheet I
            created will be handy. In the meantime, using a legal pad to keep track
            of firing works really well.</p>

            <p>Enough of the detailed game play for now! Compared to my first efforts
            back in Situation #1, I'm doing much, much better at describing game
            play. I'll have to replay some of those early games with the attention
            to detail I'm demonstrating here. But for now, I want this off the table
            in favor of a third game of StarForce exploring Scenario 3.</p>
            
            <p>Also, to be perfectly truthful, I'm a bit bored with the game at this point.
            All the photos and notes are a lot of work, without a clear payoff.
            Simply finishing this game has a great payoff: I can start another game!</p>
            
            <p>Turn 4 opens with a couple of not unlucky 4:1 +1 drm shots from the
            artillery to take out Russian infantry. It would have really hurt if I'd
            rolled a 6 on either shot. Now it's time to move, and I'm not sure
            exactly what I want to do yet. I've just figured out the the Russian
            tanks could go romping around in the German rear area, so I better
            ensure they don't get there. On the other hand, I want to ensure I get
            some protection forward to gain ground. At the moment, it's about to
            turn into a slug fest south of Hill 135.</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, the not unlucky artillery shots have been followed up
            with some definitely unlucky CATs: total whiff on all of them.</p>
            
            <p>Time for the Russians…and let's try writing out by phases. Haven't
            done this for PanzerBlitz yet.</p>
            
            <p><em>Fire determination and resolution</em>: 5 attempts: the 2 76.2 ATGs each take a shot at PzKpfw
            IVs at 1:2, scoring a D on one for their efforts. The 3 120mm mortars take
            another shot at the stack of German rifles at 4:1, and get an X; that's 3 units
            for the Russians. The two SU-85s take 1:2  shots on the PzKpfws lurking
            on the ridge east of Hill 135, score a D for their efforts. In all, not
            bad results.</p>
            
            <p>The actual phasing is defined by calling the shots, then resolving each
            one. I wrote them up together, above, to make it easier to read.</p>
            
            <p><em>Vehicle movement</em> none, the SU-85s both fired.</p>
            
            <p><em>Leg and CAT</em>: 4 attempts, managed one dispersal of a stack of Panthers
            at the south end of the Lane of Tears at 1:3 (11:32) odds. Not too bad,
            could have been better.</p>
            
            <p><em>Dead pile</em>: Germans 3, Russians 5, 1 mine removed.</p>
            
            <p>Almost half done with this game.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>
            
            <p>The Germans still have a rough way to go, but with a couple of lucky
            rolls behind them, a few more lucky rolls might just see enough units
            off the Plains of Despair to acquire at least a draw.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fire determination and resolution</strong>: The Hummel and StuH-42 (14-H-10)
            take out a Guard unit with 5/6 chance; I've been really unlucky with
            these types of shots. Panther takes on a rifle company, roll 1,
            dispersed! No effect for SG-III 75 shooting at SU-85 on the hills.
            German mortar on Hill 132 disperse a guards unit, critically important
            as this unit is about to get overrun as well, and every little bit
            helps.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Vehicle movement &amp; overrun</strong>: First up, the PzKpfw overruns
            the just now dispersed guards unit, elimination on roll 1. Overkill, but
            why take chances with Russian infantry? The second CP moves up with the
            Wespe, risking a CAT, but in the woods, this would only be a dispersal
            at worst, and then only if the SMG unit which is adjacent isn't
            eliminated or dispersed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Leg and CAT</strong>: The engineers are finally in play, moving a 1:1 on the
            SMG in the woods to a 2:1, with a roll of 2 that's an elim, and the CP
            and Wespe are safe for at least Turn 6. The Germans have been hitting
            some good rolls. Helps to be lucky.</p>
            
            <p>I wasn't going to post any more photos of the game, but this situation
            at the end of the German phase was too good to pass up:</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_g_t5.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>The Russians can still do a lot of damage to the Germans, and the
            Germans have a long way to go to get across the Plains of Despair, and
            an increasingly shorter time in which to cross.</p>
            
            <p>However, the Russians might be in a bit of trouble here. They're losing their
            infantry to heavy artillery, CATs and overruns. This is not good. And
            it's not good that the Russians just don't have that much effective fire
            this turn. For example, neither howitzer has any high value targets.</p>
            
            <p>For example, R71 (pink die showing 2 pips) really wants to combine fire
            onto the stack of SG-III 75s (G823, pink die showing single pip) on the
            nearby hillside to the south, but technically has no line of site. It's
            blocked by the forest green bar hex side.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/howitzer_los.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>Further south, the ATG R36 (red die, 2 pips) wants to fire on G931 (red
            die, 1 pip), but there is an intervening brown bar hillside closer to
            G931 than R36; no LOS. One the other hand, R31 can fire on G931, but
            probably not on G938. The optional rule allowing hex centers to
            determine LOS could allow firing, while the standard rule would find a
            green bar intervening from one the possible paths traced through hexes.</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="FIXME" src="/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/atg_los.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>It's not just "panzerbush," it's "panzerslope" as well.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fire determination &amp; resolution</strong>: Russians have 2 direct fire shots.
            First is using heavy mortars on the SG-III on the slope at 3:1. The second is
            the ATG R31 on G931 at 1:1 (12:8). For the first, roll 2 for
            elimination, about time! Second, roll 5 which is a miss.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Vehicle movement &amp; overrun</strong>: The SU-85s need to find a way to pick
            off the Germans as they cross the Plains of Despair. Might be a good
            time to decamp to Zabvenia, just to cost the Germans an extra turn.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Leg and CAT</strong>: The first CAT on the panzers failed, a second on some
            halftracks succeeded. Leg units need to move due south to
            attempt to block movement onto the Plains.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dead pile</strong>: German 4, Russian 8, 1 mine removed.</p>
            
            <p>Half done!</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>
            
            <p>It would be hard for the Russians to get a decisive victory at this
            point, but it's probably just as hard for the Germans to get a marginal
            victory, which is 30 units off Board 3.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fire determination and resolution</strong>: Had to use barrage fire to take
            out one of the fortifications. Very chancy stuff, 1/6 chance I would
            have burned out the artillery for nothing. I've gotten lucky this game
            on the dice. This will be helpful having one of the heavy mortars gone.
            I'm now thinking I'd have spent the barrage more effectively by taking
            out the CP, if I had only had a CP in line of sight for spotting.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Vehicle movement &amp; overrun</strong>: at this point, I can't really hide any
            more, and I'm going to have to make a run for the border. It's almost
            attritional, I'm going to lose as many units per turn as the Russians
            have guns. For sure, 3 units per turn, and there are 5 fire turns left
            for the Russians. However, I'm leaving the Hummel behind, and the SG-III
            75s to pester the Russian fortified CP. It may have been a mistake to
            have moved the Wespe so far forward.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Infantry &amp; CAT</strong>: Infantry is mounting up this turn. Too close to the
            end of the game to do anything else.</p>
            
            <p>Now for the Russians…</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fire determination</strong>: Only two good targets available, strangely
            enough, the PzKpfw on the slope which can be dealt with by the 122mm
            howitzer (finally), and the AFVs threatening the CP on Hill 135.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fire resolution</strong>: For the mortars, 4:1 in woods, roll 5 for
            elimination. For the howitzer, 2:1 (40/2):8, roll 3, dispersed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Vehicle movement &amp; overrun</strong>: SU-85s roll into Zabvenia.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Infantry movement &amp; CAT</strong>: The infantry is moving in a pincer
            formation to squeeze from both the north and the south. If the Germans
            are a little bit lucky, they will squirt out like a watermelon seed,
            but it will be costly. 2 CATs available, one from the north on
            halftrack, the other from the south on AFVs. Both succeed in dispersals,
            which is Bad News for Jerry.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dead pile</strong>: German 8, Russian 9, 1 mine removed.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>
            
            <p>It's appearing that moving the Wespe forward is a blunder. It's just not
            getting that many shots off.</p>
            
            <p>German:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fire determination</strong>: Hummel took at a rifle company, another rifle
            dispersed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Vehicle movement &amp; overrun</strong>: Mostly mounting up infantry and moving
            everything as far forward as possible to stay away from oncoming Russian
            infantry. Huge traffic jam in the pass south of Hill 135. Let's call it
            the Pass of Doom.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Infantry movement &amp; CAT</strong>: almost all mounting up.</p>
            
            <p>Russian:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fire determination &amp; resolution</strong>: 3 shots: 1 miss, and two dispersals.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Vehicle movement &amp; overrun</strong>: Nothing to move.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Infantry movement &amp; CAT</strong>: Spectacular CAT disperses stack of panzers
            in by the Lane of Tears. One or two more infantry units will be able to
            CAT next Russian move, might be the end of that stack. But the panzers
            served their purpose by soaking up infantry attention.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dead pile</strong>: German 10, Russian 11, 1 mine removed.</p>
            
            <p>Game will play out fast now.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h2>
            
            <p>The Germans are going to make a run for it! Nothing else they can really
            do. It's a sure loss if they stay and fight, no matter how many Russians
            they kill.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fire determination &amp; resolution</strong>: Germans dispersed guards unit on slope,
            handy. Hummel proves its worth. Wespe didn't fire.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Vehicle movement &amp; overrun</strong>: Now it's a nasty slog through the Pass
            of Doom to a mad dash across the Plains of Despair.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Infantry movement &amp; CAT</strong>: Might leave back a mortar unit for the odd
            AF or so, not sure yet.</p>
            
            <p>Russian:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fire determination &amp; resolution</strong>: Lots and lots of targets! 7 shots:
            5 eliminations, 2 dispersals. Some of the kills were transport, which
            hurts double.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Vehicle movement &amp; overrun</strong>: none.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Infantry movement &amp; CAT</strong>: Moving the mortars towards Opustschenia to
            rain some long range death on trucks. Guards and friends continue to
            pester a stack of panzers along the Lane of Tears. Can't go wrong with a
            roll of 1 in PanzerBlitz.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dead pile</strong>: German 17, Russian 10, 1 mine removed. This doesn't
            count removing the Russian fortification, but it should.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h2>
            
            <p>German strategy for Turn 9 is just run, run, run. Not even going to
            bother firing. Except for the Hummel which fired on a guards unit and
            missed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Vehicle movement &amp; overrun</strong>:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Infantry movement &amp; CAT</strong>:</p>
            
            <p>Russians can just fire and fire and fire. They're looking at a tactical
            victory almost surely, and with good rolling, a decisive is not out of
            the question.</p>
            
            <p>The Russians fired 7-8 times and hit every time, mostly kills. Lots of
            1s and 2s on the dice. Bummer for the Germans.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dead pile</strong>: German 29, Russian 11, 1 mine removed. And I am counting
            the fortification because it soaked up a lot of time to remove.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h2>
            
            <p>Germans get 9 units off the map, with most of the rest exposed,
            including panzers with a 4:1 sure kill, so it's done for me. The
            Russians got their 30 for the decisive.</p>
            
            <p>Russian had at least 1 sure kill at 4:1, so I didn't bother moving all
            the German units, just enough to ensure I had as much of the game to get
            decisive victory for the Russians.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dead pile</strong>: German 30+, Russian 11, 1 mine removed.</p>
            
            <p>Germans: 9 units exits.</p>
            
            <p>Russians: 30+ German units eliminated.</p>
            
            <p>Decisive Russian victory. Not even close.</p>
            
            <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
            
            <p>The first thing to note is that this situation can take quite a while
            for the Russian player to set up. For a first time player, budget an
            hour for the Russian. It's almost guaranteed analysis paralysis.
            The German play will also need some time to set up, probably about 30
            minutes <em>after</em> the Russians are finished. These set up times decrease
            with experience, and with multiple plays of the scenario.</p>
            
            <p>Another thing I'm sure of now, from this game, is that I'm at least very
            slightly biasing the game play for some of these solo games. It doesn't feel
            overt. It seems to come out as unconscious leaning toward to making one
            side or another have small advantages, which add up. A general example
            might be making a sub par move, or not firing on an appropriate target.
            I won't see these until after the turn finishes.</p>
            
            <p>I think the effect comes from focusing on playing one side really,
            really well, while just not thinking about the other side. The Russian
            phase in Turn 3 illustrates this perfectly. My focus was on getting the
            Germans positioned to clear a lane, with a result of being horribly
            exposed.</p>
            
            <p>If I haven't written it elsewhere, I'm not inclined to argue much about
            rules, even when I know I'm citably correct. Basically, if someone wants
            to dispute a rule or LOS or a movement, I'll geneconcede. I'll do
            this both on the player's and my turn, and allow the opponents to
            interpret as they see fit, to my disadvantage. When I'm playing myself
            in a solitaire game, I'm much more strict.</p>
            
            <h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>
            
            <p>What a brutal game. It took two or three weeks to get through. In part
            because I'm busy at work, but also because I made a determined effort to
            have a good showing for the Germans.</p>
            
            <p>Russians did not use their position as well as they could have:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The 122mm howitzer should bracket, one in Uschas or similar northern
            emplacement, the other on the south side of the board in the woods on
            Adski Hill (126). With range 20, each can fire on enemy on their half
            of the fighting ground, while overlapping to some extent in the middle.
            Having the howitzer at 1N6 is relatively ineffective in the early game.
            (It may come in to play in the later game.)</p>
              </li>
              <li>Leaving a hole at 1E3.</li>
              <li>Not reinforcing the crossroad at 1J5 with that spare Recon unit.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>German blunders include not getting a CP way forward into cover and
            defensible terrain. On the south edge of Board 1, this means Hill 126
            east of Adski. That would have been pretty tough, to be sure, but would
            have been a serious threat to the Russians.</p>
            
            <p>Barrage fire took out a fortification with a mortar. It would have been
            better to spend those tubes on a Russian CP.</p>

            <h3 id="handicapping">Handicapping</h3>
            
            <p>Tipping it in the German favor may only require removing one of the
            122mm howitzers. These are so important for wearing away at the Germans
            that losing even one will have an effect.</p>
            
            <p>One or more of the fortifications could be removed from the OOB, which
            would force the Russian player into even more of a defensive posture,
            and would change how fields of fire were established. Currently, the
            fortifications at DF 50 on top of hills are for the most part
            impregnable. A one shot elimination is not guaranteed when they're in
            wooded hexes, and in the worst case, with unit firing from below the
            hilltop, attack factors would need to total between 100 and 200 to get a
            5/6 chance of elimination. CAT atacks just can't muster enough AF
            fighting uphill.</p>
            
            <p>What would be better here would be a range of fortification strength
            from, say, 20 to 50, where the Russian player could choose which
            locations got the strongest fortifications.</p>
            
            <p>On the German side, remove one or more of the light SPAs, either the
            StuH 42 or the GW 38(M). These guns don't have a lot of power or range,
            but since they're howitzers, they get full AF on soft targets. That's a
            big deal and can tip odds a full column right.</p>

              <p>Avalon Hill's PanzerBlitz was a successor to a game called
              "Tactical Game 3," which was never developed for market. The story can
              be found on related web sites. What's important here is that the game
              does have a long and successful history, ultimately selling hundreds
              of thousands of copies.</p>
              <h3 id="panzerblitz-links">PanzerBlitz links</h3>
              
              <p>Here are a few of the best links about PanzerBlitz available on the web.</p>

              Strategist</a>,
              often referred to as "ImStrat" has an incredible collection of articles,
              counters, maps and other material related to PanzerBlitz, Panzer Leader
              and the Arab Israeli games. Seriously, ImStrat is worth hours of time.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://gregpanzerblitz.com/">Greg's PanzerBlitz Site</a> is another

              appears to be where a number of current PanzerBlitz players can be
              found. The forum is relatively relaxed and low traffic, but there is a
              lot of information available.</p>
