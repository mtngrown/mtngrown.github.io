<h1 id="situation-8-game-2">Situation #8 Game 2</h1>

<p>After the first two debacles attempting this scenario, I've set up
identically to the solo game 1 to take another stab at cracking this
puzzle. This time, I'm going to attempt to get around the south end of
the map, with some decoy elements up at the north and in the center area
to try to take some of the heat off the southern push.</p>

<p>We'll see how it goes.</p>

<h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2>

<p>As noted above, the Russian set up identically to the first solo game.
The Germans set up as far forward as possibly while maintaining cover.</p>

<h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>

<p>And the Germans are off to the races, taking a line along the southern
edge of the map. While this feels a bit "gamey," the scenario, and the
boards, don't provide much of anything else to do. This time, the heavy
guns are coming forward, as it's too hard to get the CP into position.
If I can take out 6 Russian infantry, that will be worth it.</p>

<p>The single direct fire on a Rifle company whiffed, but the close assault
did the trick with a roll of 1 at 2:1 odds. Engineers are awesome that
way.</p>

<p>The Russians don't have a lot of targets at the moment. The ATG took a
shot at the H stack threating the lane of death, but missed. One of the
Russian close assaults failed, the other dispersed a stack of 3 Panthers
with a luck roll of 1. The SU 85s decided to get in on any future action
on the south side, and most of the infantry started moving south as well.</p>

<p>Here's the end of Turn 1:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s8_g2_t1.jpg" alt="End of Turn 1" /></p>

<p>The Germans, with a little bit of dice rolling luck, may be able to not
lose too terribly badly.</p>

<h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>

<p>The Germans now have to figure out exactly where they want to use the
huge guns. This will really matter in the early game. Unless 2 or 3
infantry companies can be knocked out fast, it won't go well for the
Germans. The fire phase got Russian Recon and Rifle companies
elimated, missed on the shot to Hill 126, dispersed a Guards unit.
After fire, Germans are mounting up and moving south. There is just no
way through the north end of the map, what with the swamp and green bars
blocking so much terrain.</p>

<p>Russians apparently only have 1 direct fire target, a Russian rifle
company firing on a German platoon. That's a miss at 1:2 odds roll 5.
That probably would have been better with a close assault, since the Su
85 can move to the top of Hill 126 and be in cover. This is going to
suck for the Germans, really slow them down, and will cost them units as
being able to spot for that hex is 4/6 exposed. Nasty.</p>

<p>Here's the end of Turn 2:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s8_g2_t2.jpg" alt="End of Turn 2" /></p>

<p>It's dark outside now, hence the mellower yellow of the game photo.</p>

<h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>

<p>The Germans are going to have a really hard time taking out the Russian
145 and 146 Rifle companies, being that they are stacked on a hilltop in
a forest hex (1B6). A better idea for the Germans might be to chew the
Russian up as they advance to the south. For example, the Wespe and some
mortars took out a Guards unit foolishly left in the clear. As the
Russian player, I didn't think the Germans would have enough firepower
to touch it, in the clear or not. Roll 4 eliminates another guards
units, and a roll 2 disperses a third. This third one was a bit dicey,
as it could have spotted for the Su 85s sitting in hex 1C6. In that
case, I might have sacrificed the SG III-75s to threaten the Su 85s.
Thankfully won't need to. That's it for fire phase.</p>

<p>German movement: everything moves south.</p>

<p>Russian fire phase: nyet. There is nothing the Russians can spot. The
Germans are all hunkered down. There is only movement, and this turn,
that's leg movement only. The SU 85s can stay put for now. They might
move to Zabvenia a little later.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s8_g2_t3.jpg" alt="End of Turn 3" /></p>

<p>As can be seen in the photo, it's daylight out again.</p>

<p>Onward, through the fog.</p>

<h2 id="turn-4">Turn 4</h2>

<p>I've had this scenario set up for at least two weeks (possibly even four
weeks, can't really recall), with the intention of playing through it
one phasing player's turn at a time. That's not how it is working out.
Over the last 24 hours, I've played 2.5 turns (5 phases). There is an
off-chance I'll knock it out through the afternoon and evening today
(December 7, 2014). We'll see. In the meantime, it is Turn 4, and the
Germans have to decide what to fire on.</p>

<p>The Germans are rolling lucky, not getting 6's on d6 rolls at 4:1 in
forest. It seems like so many games of PanzerBlitz turn out to collapse
on the German inability to roll anything <em>but</em> 6's at 4:1 against
defender in forest. This is just broken, it should have a 'DD' or at
least a 'D' result for a 6 + 1 roll at 4:1. The game would play better.</p>

<p>The Russians, for the first time in quite a while in these games, are
looking a little weak where it counts. In fact, if the Germans can
shuttle over enough infantry to spot and engage the incoming Russian
infantry, the artillery units may be able to continue picking them off
one at a time. This is problem, as the Russian have been average 2
infantry companies per turn.</p>

<p>And the afternoon drifts into evening, the close of Turn 4:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s8_g2_t4.jpg" alt="End of Turn 4" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-5">Turn 5</h2>

<p>Fire phase eliminates two more Russian infantry units. The Russian are
now in trouble. There is going to be a big firefight at Adski, which the
Germans will definitely win. So far, the Russians don't have any German
units destroyed. Continue moving south.</p>

<p>Russians may be able to slow things down just a little bit. It might be
time to send the SU 85s off to collect some infantry units. Might be too
late already as it will take 3 turns minimum to acquire and unload.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s8_g2_t5.jpg" alt="End of Turn 5" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h2>

<p>Not seeing any targets for the Germans to fire on, move only turn.
Nice close assault on the SU 85 at 1:3, roll 1 dispersed. Bummer for
Russians, those AFVs are goners next turn. They stayed on the hill too
long. Bummer for them.</p>

<p>The Russians waited too long to move the SU 85s, now they can't. All
infantry moving south as best as can. But the Germans do have to get off
the map starting about right now.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s8_g2_t6.jpg" alt="End of Turn 6" /></p>

<p>Germans haven't taken any losses yet, but they are jammed up and will
lose if they can't get off the board.</p>

<h2 id="turn-7">Turn 7</h2>

<p>The clock is running fast for the Germans. It's the top of Turn 7, and
they don't have any units off the board, nor any which are even all that
close to getting off. Time to take some serious lumps to clear the towns
and get off the board.</p>

<p>Since all the long range artillery is too close to anything to shoot,
the stack of Panthers takes out an SU 85, leaving the remaining SU 85
and an ATG on Hill 126. The fighting at Adski is about to get intense.
The Russian now have some decent targets. Or would have except the other
SU 85 got dispersed on a close assault. That leaves only the ATG gun
with capability to kill armor now. Also, that dispersal was kind of
important as those infantry would be nailed by Russian artillery
otherwise.</p>

<p>ATG takes a 1:1 shot at PzKpfw IV, misses. Might have been better to
take sure shot at the halftracks which will be spotting on the next
German phase. Russian infantry is in a bind at Adski. Move forward to
close assault halftracks, German armor can occupy one of the Adski hexes
behind the Guards. That's bad. The best that can be done is keep  moving
infantry forward.</p>

<p>Here's the end of Turn 7:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s8_g2_t7.jpg" alt="End of Turn 7" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-8">Turn 8</h2>

<p>Germans really packing it in around Adski now. The Russians don't have
much there, but the terrain is really restricted, so they don't need
much either. Direct fire on the SU 85 was a miss, but the infantry was
able to disperse again on a close assault.</p>

<p>The Germans really are getting lucky on rolls this game, no doubt about
it.</p>

<p>ATG gun disperses German AFV on the block, which is a bummer for the
Germans as this PzKgfw IV was going to flank the Guards unit in Adksi.
Lacking anything better to do, the Guards units CAT the stack of trucks
which is blocking the hill. They can't really move without opening a
massive hole.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s8_g2_t8.jpg" alt="End of Turn 8" /></p>

<h2 id="turn-9">Turn 9</h2>

<p>Another roll 6 on the Russian ATG on Hill 126! That thing just won't
die. However, 1:1 mortar attack on the SU 85 rolled a 1, which is a
disperse. A 1 or 2 on a followup CAT will kill it. Some AFV took out
the Guard unit from Adksi, producing a hole in the Russian defense.
Time to move through it! But it's not enough! Germans will get less than
10 pieces off the board by Turn 10.</p>

<p>Russian ATG fires: disperse PzKpfw IV on the block. Good move, will
continue to slow down Germans. Mortar platoon took out some German
trucks. SMG dispersed German Rifle on 1:1 CAT in Adski. Make it even
more inconvenient for the Germans.</p>

<p>Situation at end of Turn 9:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s8_g2_t9.jpg" alt="End of Turn 9" /></p>

<p>Note a few units to the extreme left are not in the picture. These are
the only units which will be able to exit in 10 turns.</p>

<h2 id="turn-10">Turn 10</h2>

<p>The ATG is finally taken out. The SMG in Adksi survives a 4:1 odds, the
AFV roll a 6! 7 units make it off the board.</p>

<p>Russians disperse halftrack and infantry in Adski.</p>

<p>And that's the game:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/panzerblitz/s8_g2_t10.jpg" alt="End of Turn 10" /></p>

<p>The counters on Board 3 above Opustchenia are casualties. The counters
below Opustchenia are the 7 the Germans were able to get off the map.</p>

<h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>

<p>I'm calling this a draw.</p>

<p>As previously noted, the victory conditions seem ridiculous with respect
to playing the the standard rules as I understand those rules.
I may be playing it all wrong. Hard to tell at present.</p>

<p>This was an odd game as I moved the heavy artillery all the way to the
front, and used it in direct fire mode to blast away at Russian infantry
units. This is not how heavy artillery should be used, in real life or
in the game. It's one of those zooey things about PanzerBlitz.</p>

<p>It might be interesting to try the same technique on the north end of
the board. Getting through the gullies would be hard, but it might work.</p>

<p>It's deeply unsatisfying to have to drive the half hexes on the edge of
the map. Also deeply unsatisfying relying on a series of lucky rolls in
the first couple of turns.</p>

<p>Let's play a few more turns to see what happens.</p>

<h3 id="turn-11">Turn 11</h3>

<p>Germans get 7 more off the board, killed the SMG in Adski.</p>

<h3 id="turn-12">Turn 12</h3>

<p>12 more German units off Board 3.</p>

<h3 id="turn-13">Turn 13</h3>

<p>7 more exit.</p>

<p>That totals 33 in 13 turns.</p>

<p>Just not seeing the victory conditions as stated on the situation card.
Not even if the counts were reversed for Russian or German. The game
would have to go 15 turns.</p>

<h3 id="blunders">Blunders</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Russians should mount a guards unit on each SU 85.
For that matter, the SU 85 should just shuttle infantry units around
the board and not even worry about firing.</li>
  <li>The lower map edge hexes are the only line of hexes not covered by
fire from Hill 135. The Russians should have put another mine or block
on this route.</li>
  <li>Limiting German 120 mm mortars to 15 hex range, instead of 20 hexes as
printed on the counter. Dumb. I've done similar things before, for
example, conflating movement and DF on the Wespe.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-panzerblitz">A brief history of PanzerBlitz</h3>

<p>Avalon Hill's PanzerBlitz was a successor to a game called
"Tactical Game 3," which was never developed for market. The story can
be found on related web sites. What's important here is that the game
does have a long and successful history, ultimately selling hundreds
of thousands of copies.</p>

<h3 id="panzerblitz-links">PanzerBlitz links</h3>

<p>Here are a few of the best links about PanzerBlitz available on the web.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.imaginative-strategist.layfigures.com/">Imaginative
Strategist</a>,
often referred to as "ImStrat" has an incredible collection of articles,
counters, maps and other material related to PanzerBlitz, Panzer Leader
and the Arab Israeli games. Seriously, ImStrat is worth hours of time.</p>
