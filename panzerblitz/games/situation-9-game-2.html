            <p>Set up started on July 10, 2014.</p>
            
            <p>Playing solitaire, one is always subject to bias, both
            conscious and unconscious. Finding a way to randomizing
            behavior of one side or another always helps. In PanzerBlitz,
            the initial set up is often critically important. The terrain
            on the map boards limits effective movement for both sides.
            With the German defense consisting mostly of infantry and
            medium artillery, their defense has to be strong in key
            places, without leaving terrain uncovered by fire, or out
            of range of fast redeployment with the limited trucks and
            wagons.</p>
            
            <p>In this second game, the Russian will attempt to cross the
            German line either in the north, middle or south, to be
            determined by die roll. To the north and south, narrow but
            clear open country allows rapid passage east to west. The
            middle boasts the road, which can be traversed in just over
            2 turns by trucks. Clearing the road over Hill 132 via
            Bednost allows Russian forces extremely rapid movement.</p>
            
            <p>The Germans set up first. Mines and blocks to cut off access at the
            extreme bounds, and placed far east to bunch up the Russian
            units in the clear terrain on Board 3 as much as possible.
            Artillery is split between mortars emplaced to deal fire
            immediately, and other units on transport as mobile reserve.
            Infantry garrisons Bednost, and provides a "no-pass" line to
            the south of Hill 132.</p>
            
            <p>The die dictates: 1-2 Russians go north, 3-4 center, 5-6
            south. Roll 3, Russian will take on Hill 132 and attempt
            to clear the road through Bednost.</p>
            
            <h2 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h2>
            
            <p>Russians move first, and it's instant analysis-paralysis: how to get as
            many units on the board without attracting sure 4:1 kills from German
            artillery pounding on trucks. Not much I can do if I want to get
            everything on the board in the first turn.</p>
            
            <p>Now that the Russians are all on the board, it's party time for German
            artillery. Lucky shot for one of the 75mm howitzers: rolled a 1 for a
            truck kill at 2:1 odds. Moved the ATGs into Bednost to protect against
            those SU-152s.</p>

            <h2 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h2>
            
            <p>The Russians are already in a hard place. No matter where they go,
            something a-gonna get fired on. However, a bunch of units can be
            stacked in Opustchenia, and most of the rest can be tucked away behind
            hills, forests, etc. Upshot, 3 trucks remain exposed, which is 3 too
            many, but there are only 3 German guns which can reach them, and two
            of those are weak, 75mm howitzers.</p>
            
            <p>The Germans seem to be in a fairly good position. Only one ATG taken out
            though, the other attacks resulted in dispersals from the 75mm firing on
            trucks. Dispersal won't be enough, but it's a start.</p>

            <h2 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h2>
            
            <p>Russians have no fire targets yet, nothing is technically spotted. Time
            to move then. The main goal is to get everything set up to make a rush
            on Bednost, and take out the long range guns. At that point, I should
            be able to move units with impunity across the map. Not willing to risk
            the SU-152s yet, so they continue to position.</p>
            
            <p>Germans are about to lose some units, almost surely, hopefully they can
            take another 2 or 3 Russian units with them. And it turns out the
            Russians left a stack of trucks where the 120mm mortar could take them
            out. Great for the Germans, honest blunder on my part playing the
            Russians. Germans otherwise didn't fire so well this turn, only managing
            to disperse an SMG company. Close assaults failed. Luckily, I get
            another chance at a close assault because the Russians forgot to move
            the armor into position to take advantage of the spotting.</p>

            <p>Russians picked off guns on Hill 129, which will slow down casualties.
            Then more positioning, and dispersing some infantry around Bednost. The
            armor is swinging west to ensure an easy retreat path by knocking the
            howitzer off Hill 135.</p>
            
            <p>Germans are in a boat load of hurt. A couple of dispersals, no units
            eliminated this turn.</p>

            <p>Germans managing to whiff all direct fire. Managed to disperse some
            T-34s, but that is all.</p>

            <p>Russians move armor around Bednost, just at the half way range of 3
            hexes on a range 6 75mm ATG. It's a risk as two ATGs in Bednost could
            keep two armor pieces pinned. However, a massive close assault removes
            one of the ATGs, hence, worst case for Russians is losing 1 armor.</p>
            
            <p>Germans were only able to disperse, but they have reoccupied Bednost,
            which makes it hard for the Russians.</p>

            <p>The Russians are going to have a really hard time getting off the board.
            The Germans are just hard enough to kill to slow everything down, and
            have just enough firepower to kill lots and lots of trucks. Given 11, 12
            turns, it would be decisive Russian victory no problem at all. As it
            stands right now, the Germans have the Russians all bottled up, with
            just enough firepower to reliably pick off trucks. I need to play the
            scenario again, and next time, make the Germans run all over the map
            instead of getting all bottled up.</p>
            
            <p>Germans whiffed direct fire, managed a single CAT, still in the running
            if the Russians don't make the necessary kills.</p>

            <p>Russians chewing away at Bednost, very slow progress, going to be a lot
            of Russian units on the board at the end of the game.</p>
            
            <p>And I think I've lost track of the turn counter here, and made a double
            move by the Germans, because the way it looks right now, it's a decisive
            victory for the Germans. The reason is the Germans set up units on the
            escape road out, and there is no way the Russians will be able to
            dislodge them in two turns.</p>

            <p>Playing it out…Russians missed a 4:1 roll 6 on mortar in forest, which
            traps the two tanks on the board.</p>
            
            <p>Germans picked off another truck.</p>

            <p>Russians get 4 units off the board. Total crush by the Germans, despite
            the German losses. Embarrassing.</p>
            
            <h2 id="aar">AAR</h2>
            
            <p>The German victory here is spoiled by the fact I lost track of the turn
            counter around Turn 8, and may have both fired and moved the Germans
            twice. If this is true, the second move blocked the Russian exit from
            the board almost completely by occupying the road on the way out.</p>
            
            <p>For both these games, I've been assuming that the entire Russian force
            must enter the east edge of Board 3 on Turn 1. That is, all the Russian
            units must enter on Turn 1, none may be left off the board for entering
            at a later time. Moreover, I've been assuming the best bet is to bring
            the Russians up the road as a column.</p>
            
            <p>It might be worthwhile to play this scenario having the Russians come in
            as a front across the east edge of the map. This would let many units
            get into cover much quicker.</p>
            
            <p>The biggest lesson from this game is just avoid the German ATGs.
            Wherever they are, go somewhere else. If they're in Bednost, let them
            stay there, and trap them with sacrificial guards units so they can't
            get out. Then bolt to secure the exit road immediately, before the
            Germans figure out they need to block it.</p>

            <p>It might be interesting to allow the Russians to enter Board 3 whenever
            they want. On the one hand, it would allow the Russian armor to
            eliminate at least some of the German artillery before the unarmored
            Russian column continues to advance. On the other hand, it puts the
            Russians that much further behind on getting units off the board by the
            end of Turn 10.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Russians should have held the trucks back a couple of turns until
            either the German 75mms were cleared, or the trucks could fund cover
            from them. This cost several units.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Tracks could be used to get guards units onto the German 75mm in two
            turns, which would remove a pesky source of annoyance as those guns keep
            picking off trucks. However, the guards were all deployed on trucks.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Losing too many trucks to Germans, some of these were just blunders
            from leaving stacks in the clear. The whole point of stacking is to get
            all the vehicles behind cover.</p>

              <p>Avalon Hill's PanzerBlitz was a successor to a game called
              "Tactical Game 3," which was never developed for market. The story can
              be found on related web sites. What's important here is that the game
              does have a long and successful history, ultimately selling hundreds
              of thousands of copies.</p>
