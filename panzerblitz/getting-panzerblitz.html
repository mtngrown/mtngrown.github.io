            <p>Considering the number of copies of PanzerBlitz which were printed over
            the course of more than a decade, it's probably not surprising that the
            game isn't unduly difficult to acquire.</p>
            
            <p>From observation on Ebay, collectible quality games seem to run about $40 to
            $50, with unpunched copies starting at $50 and fetching well over $100
            at close of auction.</p>
            
            <p>If waiting until the last few minutes of an Ebay auction to watch
            something get bid right out of your budget bores you, a fair percentage
            of copies on Ebay are sold for "Buy It Now" prices ranging from $25 to
            $60.</p>
            
            <p>The key is finding a playable copy for a good price.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I have several copies, none of which I paid more than $25 to
            acquire on Ebay. Adding on shipping can send the total price to around
            $40. All the games were in great playable shape, especially considering
            their age. The boxes range from pretty good to less than fair shape.
            I've probably been lucky insofar as every copy is (apparently) counter
            complete.</p>
            
            <p>If you're an expert at Ebay auctions, you may be able to find some
            really good deals.</p>
            
            <p>You might also have a brother, cousin, uncle or some miscellaneous inlaw
            more than happy to give you their copy. Poke around, these games are out
            there, if you want one, you will find one.</p>
