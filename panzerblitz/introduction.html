<p>Among men of a certain age and experience, Avalon Hill's PanzerBlitz
game brings back memories of a truly different age. Retailing for the
vast sum (at the time) of $10, it was just within reach of enterprising
teenagers, while still being expensive enough (by far) to ensure the game
was treasured. At the time, gasoline was around $0.25/gallon.</p>

<p>Fast forward 40 years.</p>

<p>While the classical PanzerBlitz remains long, long out of print, the
game is commonly sold on Ebay, and a copy in good condition can often be
acquired for $10-$35.</p>

<p>Even better, there is community of dedicated PanzerBlitz fans who have
added an enormous amount of value to the game over the last 40 years.
New situations, new maps, new counters, and most importantly, new and
revised rules have appeared regularly over the years. Much of this
activity has been copied on to the web.</p>

<p>Given the amount of material already available, why add more?</p>

<p>The reason is simple: it's really hard to find - in one place -
a complete description and analysis of the <em>original</em> game.</p>

<p>And that's what these web pages provide: some notes on Avalon Hill's
PanzerBlitz game played out of the box, as originally shipped.</p>
