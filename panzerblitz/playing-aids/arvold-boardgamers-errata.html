    ERRATA FOR THE BOARDGAMER'S SPECIAL PANZERBLITZ ISSUE
                            by
                      Alan R. Arvold
 
   The following errata and clarifications are for the Special
Panzerblitz Issue of the Boardgamer magazine which was published
in March 2001. Anyone wishing to purchase a copy of this issue
can do so from the Boardgamer magazine which has a website at
www.bright.net/~monninb. Most of the errors listed are simple
typos and will be corrected in the next printing of the magazine.
As more errors are noticed this list will be updated.
 
Errata:
Page 22 - Prokhorovka Situation #6, Russian Order of Battle,
          Group C: There should be two KV-1c's, not one.
Page 26 - Historical Addendum to Prokhorovka, Third Column,
          German Forces: The 55th Werfer Battalion should be the
          55th Werfer Regiment.
Page 37 - Situation 17, German Order of Battle, Group E:
          The two Sg IIIb should be two SG IIIb.
Page 73 - Situation #26, Scenario Introduction, 5th Line: The
          word Grendadier should be Grenadier.
Page 73 - Situation #26 - Russian Order of Battle, Group A:
          The Weapons Class for the M-13 should be H, not J.
          (There is no Weapons Class J in Panzerblitz.)
Page 74 - Situation #27 - Russian Order of Battle, Group C:
          The Weapons Class for the M-13 should be H, not J.
 
Countersheet - The German Sd Kfz 10/4 and the Ostwind counters
               should have a Weapons Class of H, not A.
               Two of the German Motorcycle units are missing
               their Range Factors and have their Weapons Class
               printed where the Range Factor should be. The
               other two German Motorcycle units are correct
               though.
               The T-34 counters are T-34a, not T-34c.
               The Churchill Mk counters should be Churchill
               Mk III.
 
Clarification:
Through out the book the Russian BT-8 is listed as having a
Weapons Class of H. This is not a typo. In the original article
where the BT-8 was introduced back in the General Vol.13-3 it was
listed as having a Weapons Class of A. This has since been proven
to be in error. The BT-8, which is in reality the BT-7a, was a
support tank which carried a little snub-nosed 76.2mm/L16.5 gun.
This gun fired HE as their primary round. Although the gun did
have an AP round, it was for self-defence only. The majority of
the rounds that this tank carried were HE due to its support
role. Hence the change to the present Weapons Class of H.
