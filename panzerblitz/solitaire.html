            <h1 id="panzerblitz-solitaire-play">PanzerBlitz solitaire play</h1>
            
            <p>PanzerBlitz is surprisingly easy to play solitaire, but can be surprisingly difficult
            to "win." It can also be surprisingly fun. Here are a few guidelines:</p>
            
            <p>The benefits of playing solitaire are numerous:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Clock time is relatively unimportant. Playing through a situation can
            take as much or as little time as you desire. Given you have a place
            where the game won't be disturbed, playing out a game over several
            days might make the difference between playing or not playing.</li>
              <li>It's easy to play through the same situation multiple times,
            considering different strategies and tactics.</li>
              <li>When clock time is unimportant, each turn can be considered in
            detail. There is time to takes notes, and time to read through the
            rules very carefully.</li>
              <li>Conversely, games can be run with a timer, where each turn is knocked
            out in, say, six to ten minutes. Playing fast will expose blunders in
            playing very quickly.</li>
              <li>Getting familiar with situations at one's leisure really helps game
            play when you have an opponent. The first time setting up a situation
            is the hardest and takes the longest. For people suffering from an
            occasional bout of analysis paralysis, suffering through the "set up
            blues" solitaire means not inflicting them on a live opponent. Plus
            you might learn a winning advantage.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>PanzerBlitz lends itself well to solitaire, as it's challenging to play
            each side to one's best ability, and let the game play dictate the
            "winner."</p>
            
            <h2 id="how-to-balance-solitaire-play">How to balance solitaire play</h2>
            
            <p>Balancing play in solitaire games is difficult as a tendency to favor
            one side or another always seems to lurk just below the level of
            conscious thought.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Use the 1-finger rule to speed up game play and reduce favoritism.
            The notion is that once a unit is moved, and the fingers which moved
            the unit lift, it's done. No going back and revisiting a move, what's
            done is done. (This would also work to speed up game play with two
            players.)</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Randomize smartly. For example suppose the situation called for the Germans
            to set up first (e.g., Situation #1), and the Russians to enter on any side of
            the board. Instead of choosing in advance which board the Russians enter on,
            let the dice choose. That way, the "Germans" will have to cover all sides.
            Conversely, suppose the Russians set up first as in Situation #3. Where should the
            Germans attempt to punch through? Throw the dice!</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Note that playing solitaire doesn't necessarily imply "evenly matched
            opponents." Some PanzerBlitz scenarios are notoriously difficult for the
            Germans, and for an inexperienced player, will feel highly unbalanced.
            This simply means that the Germans must be played differently than the
            Russians, and that playing the German side well takes some experience.</p>
            
            <h2 id="guidelines-for-situations">Guidelines for Situations</h2>
            
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Situation #1</strong> The Russians can enter from any side, which is
            problematic when playing solitaire, because the German side can
            set up to exploit a known Russian entry. After the Germans set up,
            to randomize the Russian entry roll a d4
            (or d8) and count from North edge of board as 1, east as 2, etc.
            If rolling a d6, just ignore rolls of 5 or 6 and re-roll until
            1-4 is obtained. This way the Germans will have to consider Russians
            coming in from any side.</p>
            
                <p>Once a first game is determined, given an identical German
            deployment, further games can have Russians advancing from each
            side subsequently.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Situation #2</strong> After the Russians set up,
            roll d6 to choose which board the Germans enter on.
            It really doesn't make a lot of difference in this situation, as
            entering from the center board in road march order puts the German
            player 1/2 turn behind at most, regardless of where the Russian
            advance is met.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Situation #3</strong> Roll d6 to determine which board the Germans will
            attempt to drive a corridor through. This
            ensures that the Russians won't anticipate the German push. Note that
            a Russian strategy of having units mounted at the beginning of the
            game practically dictates these units are located on Board 2. If the
            German player decides to feint, the die should determine to which
            side: even east, west odd.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Situation #4</strong> Very little initial randomization is necessary,
            which frees a solitaire player to mix up the entry strategy for both
            German and Russian forces. These initial conditions make Situation #4
            a pretty good solitaire play.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Situation #5</strong> doesn't present any obvious Russian randomizations.
            The game could be tilted by assigning numbers to each of the Russian
            units and locations, and enforce random placement, but this is a
            fair bit of work. For German strategy, a die roll could determine
            which of the three viable corridors across Board 1 will be forced
            (because they <em>will</em> have to be forced).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Situation #6</strong> presents three choices for the Russians to cross
            Board 2: north of Bednost, through Bednost, or south of Bednost.
            Set up the Germans to protect against any choice, then roll the dice!</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Situation #7</strong> has an unusual condition: out of the box, it's a
            guaranteed Russian win, provided the Russians pretty much don't do
            anything. The Germans have to do all the work.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Situation #8</strong> is a very difficult situation for the Germans, as
            the Russians control incredibly defensible terrain which is also very
            slow moving for the Germans. One way to play this solitaire is spend
            the time getting a solid Russian defense emplaced, then vary the
            German strategy for punching through.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>There are surely more interesting and innovative ways to create
            solitaire playability. Ideas and pointers welcome.</p>

              <p>Avalon Hill's PanzerBlitz was a successor to a game called
              "Tactical Game 3," which was never developed for market. The story can
              be found on related web sites. What's important here is that the game
              does have a long and successful history, ultimately selling hundreds
              of thousands of copies.</p>
              <h3 id="panzerblitz-links">PanzerBlitz links</h3>
              
              <p>Here are a few of the best links about PanzerBlitz available on the web.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.imaginative-strategist.layfigures.com/">Imaginative
              Strategist</a>,
              often referred to as "ImStrat" has an incredible collection of articles,
              counters, maps and other material related to PanzerBlitz, Panzer Leader
              and the Arab Israeli games. Seriously, ImStrat is worth hours of time.</p>

                <li>
                  <p><a href="http://gregpanzerblitz.com/">Greg's PanzerBlitz Site</a> is another

              appears to be where a number of current PanzerBlitz players can be
              found. The forum is relatively relaxed and low traffic, but there is a
              lot of information available.</p>
