                  Turn Sequences
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Wargames attempt to simulate some sort of historical, or at least plausible
                  sequence of events by way of defining who gets to do what and when. Often,
                  turns sequences are pretty simple. Consider the classic IGOUGO: I move, I shoot,
                  you move, you shoot, repeat for next turn. This is fine for very simple games.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the complexity of the simulation increases, the turn sequence increases in
                  complexity as well. Moving might involve airborne, truck borne, and leg units
                  all in the same turn. Shooting might involve small arms, artillery, naval
                  gunfire, air support and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Weave in reaction or opportunity fire phases, and turn sequences start to get
                  pretty complicated. It's hard to remember all the moving parts, and how those
                  moving parts fit together. My best technique for learning any game's turn
                  sequence is to write out a complete play of the game, step by step through
                  each turn. That's pretty tedious when each step or phase in the turn sequence
                  has to be written each time. It's a lot easier when the complete turn sequence
                  is already written out in advance. Then, for each turn, the entire sequence can
                  be pasted right in to the narrative. Writing up the game play becomes fill-in-the-blanks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Just a simple description of each phase or step in a turn isn't enough. Each
                  phase or step should reference the part of the rules best explaining that
                  part of the turn. This is especially convenient when the rule book is formatted
                  with section and subsection numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following lists various games for which I've made turn sequences. Each is
                  cross-referenced when possible. Feel free to copy at will, but do consider
                  writing up your own turn sequences. Writing is an excellent way of self-teaching,
                  and copying an pasting doesn't promote learning.
                </p>

                  Arab-Israeli Wars
                </h2>
                <p>
                  If you have played PanzerBlitz or Panzer Leader, you will be initially comfortable
                  with the Arab Israeli turn sequence. This is a good thing, and a bad thing. AIW
                  brings so much more to the table, and all that extra stuff is lodged into the turn
                  sequence. For example, bringing a unit back from being dispersed happens in a different
                  part of the turn. If you play this the same as PanzerBlitz or Panzer Leader, you're
                  doing it wrong (and you'll probably lose).

                What to play next?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
                full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
                I'm dealing with the decision.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
                  been published recently, within the last two or three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
                  "classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
                  PanzerGruppe Guderian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
                  games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
                  games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
                  than most people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
                  game design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
                  from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
                  tried and true.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
                  the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
                  which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
                  a very large or long game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
                enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
                a sense of progress.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Upcoming Fall 2015
              </h3>
              <p>
                Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
                plays to learn rules and scenarios.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
                  solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
                  which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
                  My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
                  opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
                  a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
                  play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
                  Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
                  <i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
                  War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
                  blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
                  <b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
                  the map.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
                  while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
                  found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
                number of other games with opponents along the way.
