                  Turn Sequences
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Wargames attempt to simulate some sort of historical, or at least plausible
                  sequence of events by way of defining who gets to do what and when. Often,
                  turns sequences are pretty simple. Consider the classic IGOUGO: I move, I shoot,
                  you move, you shoot, repeat for next turn. This is fine for very simple games.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the complexity of the simulation increases, the turn sequence increases in
                  complexity as well. Moving might involve airborne, truck borne, and leg units
                  all in the same turn. Shooting might involve small arms, artillery, naval
                  gunfire, air support and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Weave in reaction or opportunity fire phases, and turn sequences start to get
                  pretty complicated. It's hard to remember all the moving parts, and how those
                  moving parts fit together. My best technique for learning any game's turn
                  sequence is to write out a complete play of the game, step by step through
                  each turn. That's pretty tedious when each step or phase in the turn sequence
                  has to be written each time. It's a lot easier when the complete turn sequence
                  is already written out in advance. Then, for each turn, the entire sequence can
                  be pasted right in to the narrative. Writing up the game play becomes fill-in-the-blanks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Just a simple description of each phase or step in a turn isn't enough. Each
                  phase or step should reference the part of the rules best explaining that
                  part of the turn. This is especially convenient when the rule book is formatted
                  with section and subsection numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following lists various games for which I've made turn sequences. Each is
                  cross-referenced when possible. Feel free to copy at will, but do consider
                  writing up your own turn sequences. Writing is an excellent way of self-teaching,
                  and copying an pasting doesn't promote learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  Arab-Israeli Wars
                </h2>
                <p>
                  If you have played PanzerBlitz or Panzer Leader, you will be initially comfortable
                  with the Arab Israeli turn sequence. This is a good thing, and a bad thing. AIW
                  brings so much more to the table, and all that extra stuff is lodged into the turn
                  sequence. For example, bringing a unit back from being dispersed happens in a different
                  part of the turn. If you play this the same as PanzerBlitz or Panzer Leader, you're
                  doing it wrong (and you'll probably lose).

                  Fire in the Lake was acquired, by myself and one of my gaming opponents.
                  Hence, it's bumping a bunch of other games down in the rotation. Looking
                  forward to this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
                  Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
                  America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
                  this game is still in shrink.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
                Stay tuned for more reports.
