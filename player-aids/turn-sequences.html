<h1>
Turn Sequences
</h1>
<p>
Wargames attempt to simulate some sort of historical, or at least plausible
sequence of events by way of defining who gets to do what and when. Often,
turns sequences are pretty simple. Consider the classic IGOUGO: I move, I shoot,
you move, you shoot, repeat for next turn. This is fine for very simple games.
</p>
<p>
As the complexity of the simulation increases, the turn sequence increases in
complexity as well. Moving might involve airborne, truck borne, and leg units
all in the same turn. Shooting might involve small arms, artillery, naval
gunfire, air support and more.
</p>
<p>
Weave in reaction or opportunity fire phases, and turn sequences start to get
pretty complicated. It's hard to remember all the moving parts, and how those
moving parts fit together. My best technique for learning any game's turn
sequence is to write out a complete play of the game, step by step through
each turn. That's pretty tedious when each step or phase in the turn sequence
has to be written each time. It's a lot easier when the complete turn sequence
is already written out in advance. Then, for each turn, the entire sequence can
be pasted right in to the narrative. Writing up the game play becomes fill-in-the-blanks.
</p>
<p>
Just a simple description of each phase or step in a turn isn't enough. Each
phase or step should reference the part of the rules best explaining that
part of the turn. This is especially convenient when the rule book is formatted
with section and subsection numbers.
</p>
<p>
The following lists various games for which I've made turn sequences. Each is
cross-referenced when possible. Feel free to copy at will, but do consider
writing up your own turn sequences. Writing is an excellent way of self-teaching,
and copying an pasting doesn't promote learning.

<h2>
Arab-Israeli Wars
</h2>
<p>
If you have played PanzerBlitz or Panzer Leader, you will be initially comfortable
with the Arab Israeli turn sequence. This is a good thing, and a bad thing. AIW
brings so much more to the table, and all that extra stuff is lodged into the turn
sequence. For example, bringing a unit back from being dispersed happens in a different
part of the turn. If you play this the same as PanzerBlitz or Panzer Leader, you're
doing it wrong (and you'll probably lose).

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
