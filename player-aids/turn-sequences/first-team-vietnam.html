<h3 id="command-phase">Command Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">(4.11) The American player gets 20 Command Points to manuever,
fight and supply his forces.</p>

<p>US gets 20 points.</p>

<h3 id="intelligence-phase">Intelligence Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The American player may expend Command Points to reveal face-down
Landing Zone counters, and to attempt to Identify or Contact NVA
units. There is no Intelligence Phase on Turn 15.</p>

<h4 id="locate-lzs">Locate LZs</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">(5.0) Spend one command point to flip one LZ marker face up.</p>

<h4 id="locate-nva">Locate NVA</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">(5.1) US may attempt to Identify or Contact NVA units. Either
action succeeds on a d6 roll of 1, with DRMs of +1 per Command
Point to a maximum of 3. To Identify, the successful roll moves 1 or
more NVA units from Unknown Box to an appropriate Zone Display.
Contact works in a similar manner.</p>

<h3 id="st-american-assault-phase">1st American Assault Phase</h3>

<h4 id="supply-segment">Supply Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">(4.13A) American player may purchase supply counters to place at An Khe,
1 Command Point per supply counter.</p>

<h4 id="first-airstrike-segment">First Airstrike Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">(7.0) Airstrikes may be against Locations containing
(contacted) NVA units, or against a Zone Box on the Zone
Display. The only column shift is for combat superiority.
Sum the Strike factors of committed aircraft for determining
combat strength, attack each NVA unit individually.</p>

<h4 id="first-transport-segment">First Transport Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Helicopters cost 1 CP to move a unit or a Supply token.
Pathfinder unit accompanying others turns any Location into
an LZ.</p>

<h4 id="ground-movement-segment">Ground Movement Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Ground Movement (10.1) Infantry units may either move from one location
to a connected location, OR a HOLD market may be placed on the unit.
Move up to 2 locations along connected major or minor road. Check for
NVA Ambush condition (13.6).</p>

<h4 id="support-segment">Support Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">From table on page Rule 8 (p. 25), allocate artillery (1-2 CP),
tactical air strikes (2 CP), and combat helicopter strikes (1 CP).</p>

<h4 id="open-combat-segment">Open Combat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Combat (11.0): either open combat, or ambush, only occurs in between
American and NVA forces in the same location. American units are never
required to attack. NVA <em>must</em> attack if American total combat strength is
equal to or less than NVA total combat strength, otherwise <em>cannot</em> attack.</p>

<h4 id="final-transport-segment">Final Transport Segment.</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Same procedure as first transport segment.</p>

<h4 id="first-target-determination-segment">First Target Determination Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Check for priority targets in Zones occupied by Identified NVA units
(NVA units in the Zone Display), then check how many Identified units
attack the priority target, then check to see if this is actually an
ambush. Note that <em>Identified</em> NVA units in the <em>Zone Display</em> are the
subject of this phase.</p>

<h4 id="nva-offboard-movement-segment">NVA Offboard Movement Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Roll 2d6 and cross-reference NVA Offboard Movement Table.</p>

<h4 id="second-target-determination-segment">Second Target Determination Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Skip if no Offboard Movement OR Turn 15, otherwise
repeat First Target Determination Segment.</p>

<h4 id="nva-ground-movement-segment">NVA Ground Movement Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Ground movement is conducted by <em>Contacted</em> NVA units, that is,
NVA units which are at a Location on the map. Break ties by moving
towards Pleiku if possible.</p>

<h4 id="nva-ambush-segment">NVA Ambush Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Ambush (13.6) may occur if US ground forces first enter an NVA-occupied
location, or NVA forces first enter a US-occupied, non-SF camp location.
See Section 11.32 for Ambush results resolution.</p>

<h4 id="nva-open-combat-segment">NVA Open Combat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">(11.1) NVA must initiate combat if NVA strength is equal to or
greater than US combat strength, otherwise NVA Open Combat is prohibited
(NVA ambush is still allowed).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Start at Column 1 on CRT:
1. Determine Combat superiority
2. Determine Combat efficiency
3. Ambush?
4. Supporting locations?
5. HOLD marker
6. Artillery
7. NVA night attack
8. Out of supply
9. Observation helicopters</p>

<h4 id="nva-evasion-segment">NVA Evasion Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">(13.7) NVA units attempt to evade if they are Broken or outnumbered.
Broken units evade on a roll of 1-5. Subtract 1 for each adjacent
location with only US forces. (13.73) Successful evasion moves the unit to the
corresponding Zone Display box. Broken units move into Cambodia one box
per successive phase.</p>

<h4 id="american-maintenance-segment">American Maintenance Segment</h4>
