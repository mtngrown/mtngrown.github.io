<p>Recap previous turn, and present challenges for both players for
this upcoming turn.</p>

<h3 id="replacement--reinforcement-phase-rule-20">Replacement &amp; Reinforcement Phase (rule 2.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>1</code>. VM receives reinforcement, if the VP level is equal to
or less than the current VM number (rule 2.1).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>2</code>. VM decides on mix of SD and Replacement Points
(rule 2.2). Regiments may receive replacements.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>4</code>. VM may mobilize an equal number of Tieu Doans
from Tieu Doan/Pathet Lao Box 2 as half the number
of VM-friendly VP hexes. Place them within 2 hexes
of a Vietnamese mobilization center (rule 9.0-2).
VM may place a Pathet Lao, from the same box, in a
VM-friendly mobilization center in Laos if there are
more VM-friendly centers in Laos than there are
Pathet Laos. Finally, move all units from box 1 to
box 2 (rule 2.4).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>5</code>. FEF receives reinforcement and pays VP, or places
them on the Turn track (rule 2.5).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>6</code>. FEF decides on mix of SD and replacement points
(rule 2.6). Units may receive replacements.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>7</code>. FEF withdraws units (rule 2.7).</p>

<h3 id="vm-player-movement-phase-rule-30">VM Player Movement Phase (rule 3.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>8</code>. VM may move all VM units (rules 3.1, 3.8, 4.5, 6.14,
7.5). Units may double move (rule 3.2) and use
transports (rules 3.3, 3.4). Units may overrun
(rule 6.4).</p>

use transports (rules 3.3 - 3.7). Units may overrun
(rule 6.4).</p>

<h3 id="attrition-phase-rule-50">Attrition Phase (rule 5.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>10</code>. All units with an OoS marker will lose 1 step each as
attrition unless able to draw supply (rule 5.0).</p>

<h3 id="operation-phase-rule-60">Operation Phase (rule 6.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>11</code>. Both players receive 10 operation points and both decide whether to spend an SD or not (rule 6.2).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>12</code>. VM rolls to get 1, 2 or 3 operation points (rule 6.1).</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Each point (rule 6.3) allows you to either:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Remove 3 DG / destroyed road markers (rule 4.5).</li>
  <li>Exchange an SD for 3 trench markers.</li>
  <li>Move a stack of units (see number 8 above).</li>
  <li>Destroy roads (rule 6.7).
If an SD was spent then you may also choose to</li>
  <li>Barrage with artillery (rule 6.6)</li>
  <li>Attack with troops (rules 6.4, 6.7 - 6.15).
After the point/points are spent then it is FEF's turn.</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>13</code>. FEF rolls to get 1, 2 or 3 operation points (rule 6.1).</p>

After all operations are finished, removing all Supply markers in
Spending status which were used during the current turn Operations

<h3 id="supply-check-phase-rule-70">Supply Check Phase (rule 7.0):</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>14</code>. All units check for supply (rules 7.1 - 7.4). If a unit

<p class="turn-sequence"><code>15</code>. Reset the Phase marker, the VM truck transport
marker, the FEF air transport marker and move
the Month marker and start at number 1 again

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.
</p>

<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
