<h2 id="turn-sequence">Turn Sequence</h2>

<h3 id="support-phase">1. Support Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player indicates available air, airmobile, and riverine support
on his record sheet, placing appropriate markers on the General
Record Track.</p>

<h3 id="special-operations-designation-phase">2. Special Operations Designation Phase</h3>

<ul class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The US player notes any units on holding or patrol operations.</li>
  <li>The NLF also notes units on holding or patrol operations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strategic-movement-phase">3. Strategic Movement Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player may conduct security operations and employ strategic
and naval movement.</p>

<h3 id="operations-phase">4. Operations Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The heart of the Vietnam <em>1965-1975</em> game is the <em>operation</em>.
The three main things to remember about operations are:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The NLF player always determines who performs the next operation,
and may choose to pass in favor of the US player performing an
operation (Section 5, page 9).</li>
  <li>Each unit may perform only one operation per turn (Section 2.2, page 5).</li>
  <li>Operations proceed as a series of <em>rounds</em> until the US declines is
unable to perform further operations. The NLF then decides to either
continue operations or end the Operations Phase (Section 5, page 9).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operations are explained in brief in Section 2.2, page 5,
and described in detail in Section 5, page 9 of the rules.</p>

<h4 id="a-designation-segment">A. Designation Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">As explained in the preface material in Section 5 (page 9), the
NLF always designates who conducts the next operation. The designated
player is the <em>phasing</em> player and commences to:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Choose the type of operation;</li>
  <li>Choose which units participate;</li>
  <li>Specify the <em>target hex</em> of the units (if applicable).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Operation:</li>
  <li>Units:</li>
  <li>Target Hex:</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="operation-1">Operation 1</h5>

<h4 id="b-support-declaration-segment">B. Support Declaration Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The US player may:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>assign air support;</li>
  <li>assign naval support;</li>
  <li>declare free fire zones.</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Section 5.1 (page 9) contains details.</p>

<h5 id="operation-1--fill-in-here">Operation 1 … (fill in here)</h5>

<h4 id="c-movement-segment">C. Movement Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The movement segment applies only during Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, Security, Naval Transport, or Strategic
Movement Operations.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operating player moves any units assigned to the current
operation; may enter ZOCs and Target Hex, may move <em>through</em>
enemy hexes (and be subject to Incidental Attacks [4.11]).
Airmobile points may be used.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">REACTION: At the end of enemy Operating movement, any friendly units
in the ZOC and not the Target Hax may move their full movement
allowance in Reaction. [4.9]</p>

<h5 id="operation-1--fill-in-here-1">Operation 1 … (fill in here)</h5>

<h4 id="d-alert-segment-only-in-us-operations">D. Alert Segment (only in US operations)</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The Alert segment only applies during allied Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, amd Bombardment Operations. The Operating
player may perform Interdiction [7.5.2]; the NLF player may
Alert [4.8].</p>

<h5 id="operation-1--fill-in-here-2">Operation 1 … (fill in here)</h5>

<h4 id="e-combat-segment">E. Combat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The Combat segment only applies during Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, Security, and Bombardment Operations.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Units ending movement in a Target Hex <strong>must</strong> have
combat; units ending movement <strong>adjacent</strong> to enemy
hexes <strong>may</strong> declare combat. If combat is not declared
after movement, the Operation ends immediately. Specifically,
Operations without a Target Hex, or when a Target Hex
cannot be declared end immediately on conclusion of
movement.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">GROUND SUPPORT may be declared with artillery, naval, and air.
Increase Attack and Defense Factors by up to 3x ground combat
strength with either: 1/2 the amount of declared
support, or; full declared support if Free Fire is declared.
Full support strength is used when determining losses.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">INTERDICTION: Either or both players declare interdiction
here. [7.5.2]</p>

<h5 id="operation-1--fill-in-here-3">Operation 1 … (fill in here)</h5>

<h4 id="f-retreat-segment">F. Retreat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">Applies to Security Operations as well. Defending player
may move their full Movement Point allowance. If the FWA
are non-Operating, they may active Defensive Reserves [6.10.2].</p>

<h5 id="operation-1--fill-in-here-4">Operation 1 … (fill in here)</h5>

<h4 id="g-pursuit-segment">G. Pursuit Segment</h4>

<h4 id="i-continuous-operations-combat-segment">I. Continuous Operations Combat Segment</h4>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
Upcoming Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
Here's a load of upcoming plays for Fall 2015. These are all scheduled for solo
plays to learn rules and scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brian Train's <i>Green Beret</i>. This is a two person game, which I'm going to
solo a few turns on to get the rules figured out. It has hidden information
which makes it fairly tedious to solo effectively.
</li>
<li>
<i>Downtown</i>, GMT's game on the air war in the Vietnam War. Has a great reputation.
My plan is to play the first couple of scenarios to learn the rules. I have an
opponent lined up for future games. Really looking forward to this one.
</li>
<li>
GDW's <i>Suez '73, The Battle of Chinese Farm</i>. Purported to be a classic. It has
a number of scenarios, the first of which is a 1 turn effort which is what I'll
play on this round. The campaign goes 10-12 turns.
Update: <i>Tonkin</i> subsituted for this as I have found an opponent for Tonkin, and
<i>Suez '73</i> turns out to be much more involved than I imagined.
</li>
<li>
<i>Karelia '44</i>, an SCS game on the last(?)  battle of the Finnish-Russian Continuation
War. I recall it's supposed to be pretty good. <b>Finns concede, hurt by a massive
blunder allowing artillery to be overrun on a retreat back to the VTL.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Case Blue</i> Kharkov 1942 scenario, 6 turns. This is doable even for me.
</li>
<li>
Operation Dynamo from <i>France '40</i>. I've played Sickle Cut solo and opposed.
<b>Allied sudden death win, enabled by French forces slipping off the south edge of
the map.</b>
</li>
<li>
<i>Hapsburg Eclipse</i>, a 4th play. I like these States of Siege games once in a
while. They usually play pretty quickly as the game system hammers me. I've
found the best way to win is to sit down for a "short, fast game."
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is probably a good two months worth of play, maybe 3. I'll be playing a fair
number of other games with opponents along the way.

<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
