<h3 id="operations-phase">4. Operations Phase</h3>

<p class="turn-sequence">The heart of the Vietnam <em>1965-1975</em> game is the <em>operation</em>.
The three main things to remember about operations are:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>The NLF player always determines who performs the next operation,
and may choose to pass in favor of the US player performing an
operation (Section 2.2.1, page 5).</li>
  <li>Each unit may perform only one operation per turn (Section 2.2, page 5).</li>
  <li>Operations proceed as a series of <em>rounds</em> until the US declines is
unable to perform further operations. The NLF then decides to either
continue operations or end the Operations Phase (Section 2.2.1, page 5).</li>
</ol>

<p class="turn-sequence">Operations are explained in brief in Section 2.2, page 5,
and described in detail in Section 2.2.1, page 5 of the rules.</p>

<h4 id="a-designation-segment">A. Designation Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">As explained in the preface material in Section 5 (page 9), the
NLF always designates who conducts the next operation. The designated
player is the <em>phasing</em> player and commences to:</p>

<ol class="turn-sequence">
  <li>Choose the type of operation;</li>
  <li>Choose which units participate;</li>
  <li>Specify the <em>target hex</em> of the units (if applicable).</li>

<h4 id="e-combat-segment">E. Combat Segment</h4>

<p class="turn-sequence">The Combat segment only applies during Search &amp; Destroy,
Clear &amp; Secure, Security, and Bombardment Operations.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">Units ending movement in a Target Hex <strong>must</strong> have
combat; units ending movement <strong>adjacent</strong> to enemy
hexes <strong>may</strong> declare combat. If combat is not declared
after movement, the Operation ends immediately. Specifically,
Operations without a Target Hex, or when a Target Hex
cannot be declared end immediately on conclusion of
movement.</p>

<p class="turn-sequence">GROUND SUPPORT may be declared with artillery, naval, and air.
Increase Attack and Defense Factors by up to 3x ground combat
strength with either: 1/2 the amount of declared
support, or; full declared support if Free Fire is declared.
Full support strength is used when determining losses.</p>

<h3>
What to play next?
</h3>
<p>
Deciding what to play next is always a tough call when faced with a closet
full of games, all of which were purchased with intent to play. Here's one
I'm dealing with the decision.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Something New</b>: this means both something new to me and a game which has
been published recently, within the last two or three years.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Classic</b>: I've acquired a number of games properly considered
"classic" which haven't yet been played. The current example would be
PanzerGruppe Guderian.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Again</b>: mastery requires constant practice, which means playing
games many, many times to allow nuance to appear.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Vietnam</b>: as I'm on a Vietnam binge. I don't have all the Vietnam
games ever published, but I can say that I have a lot of them, and probably more
than most people.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Obscure</b>: as it's fun to poke around in the dustier corners of
game design.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Different</b>: break away from the same old publishers and try a game
from one of the new kids on the block. Or, conversely, dip into legacy with a classic
tried and true.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Light</b>: once in a while it's nice to actually finish a game all
the way through in one sitting, in an hour or two.
</li>
<li>
<b>Something Heavy</b>: if possible, it's nice to set up something big and complicated
which can be left out for days or weeks or even months, for a leisurely stroll through
a very large or long game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are surely many more ways to choose, but the above method keeps me busy
enough, helps me get both breadth and depth into my play, and provides me with
a sense of progress.
</p>
<h3>
The odd man out
</h3>
<p>When there is an odd man out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a solo game ready to play.</li>
  <li>Keep score or advise on a game in progress.</li>
  <li>Referee a game in progress.</li>
</ul>
