The first game of Ogre. Solo.

I'm writing this up a little after the fact, so yeah, apparently there
is a little intrafaction action going on here, what with the PE defense
taking on an apparently rogue PE ogre. Or maybe the ogre is loyalist,
and bent on crushing a rebel PE command post.

Who can say?

Who cares?

The upshot was an Mark III win, tactical, didn't get all the way back
off the south side of the map before losing treads.

Very sure lots of "rules" were folded, spindled or otherwise mutilated,
but a good time was had by all.
