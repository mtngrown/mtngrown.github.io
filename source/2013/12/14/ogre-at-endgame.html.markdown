Saturday afternoon Ogre session with a few folks from the Ogre Launch
Party West. We played Situation T (which I came in 2d), Breakthrough,
and a game of Classic Mark III.

Ogre is a pretty simple game, and the realism is best understood to be
"physics in the Ogreverse," but it does have a surprising amount of
playability. The scenarios are simple enough to learn to play, but they
have also been brutally play tested to provide a high degree of balance.
The balance is mitigated with enough die roll randomness to keep
experienced players on their toes, and allow inexperienced players a
shot at an occasional win. This is not a bad thing.

This isn't to say that each faction is as easily played in every
scenario. For example, with two beginners playing Classis Mark III, the
Ogre player is almost certainly going to win. But with two experienced
players, the defense will almost always take out the Ogre (experienced
players are encouraged to balance the scenario by dropping 2 armor
units).

Not really a big fan of Exercise T though, seems like too much of a
shoot 'em up.
