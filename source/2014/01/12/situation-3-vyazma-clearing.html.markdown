Got in a game of Situation #3 with AS. I haven't played this one solo
yet.

The game turned out to be a draw: AS as the Germans was not able to
clear a line 3 hexes wide. The Russians ended up leaving a few hexes
uncovered by fire, mainly gully and hillslope hexes.

Turns out to be pretty tough for the Russians to keep the line covered,
but as difficult for the Germans to force a penetration.

## Blunders

* Infantry cannot engage halftracks at range, they must close assault. In
this game I picked off a few halftracks with infantry parked in
Grabyosh.
