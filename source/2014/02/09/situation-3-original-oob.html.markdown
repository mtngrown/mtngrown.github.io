Al S. played Russian against my German. I used the original scenario
OOB.

I won this one, barely, some details:

* Russian did not establish and defend long range battery fields of fire.

* Russian did not effectively transport infantry.

* German was effective in moving rapidly into a blocking position to
maintain clear hexes on Board 1 south of Adski. The Russian was unable
to dislodge this line and push back. Terrain helped prevent Russian from
flanking.

For the Russian player in this scenario, movement is critical. Infantry
units held in reserve in other parts of the map need to move as fast as
possible to a blocking position to prevent the Germans to punch a hole
in the line.
