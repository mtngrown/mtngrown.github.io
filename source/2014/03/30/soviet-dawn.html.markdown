Played a few games of Soviet Dawn to get to grips with the rules.
I won the first few, amazingly, then lost the next couple. I did
not score any of the wins or losses.

This is an interesting system. Very luck-based in a real sense, but
understanding how to play the odds is critically important. If it's
well-designed, a good player ought to be able to beat it about 50%
of the time. Looking forward to future plays.
