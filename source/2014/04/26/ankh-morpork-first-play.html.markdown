This is really Martin Wallace's Diskworld game, but in the "Collectors
Edition" which has fancier parts.

I was Lord de Worde, and CC turned out to be Lord Selachii, and won.

Turns out we both had the same victory conditions, but I had confused
control with having buildings on an area, which isn't technically
necessary. So CC got there first.

Fun game, looking forward to playing it again.

We also played 3 games of Cathedral, a small abstract game played with
wooden blocks in the shape of buildings. The goal is to have your
buildings all get emplaced at the expense of the other player's
buildings. I won one, CC won 2.
