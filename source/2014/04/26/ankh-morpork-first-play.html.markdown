This is really Martin Wallace's Diskworld game, but in the "Collectors
Edition" which has fancier parts.

I was Lord de Worde, and CC turned out to be Lord Selachii, and won.

Turns out we both had the same victory conditions, but I had confused
control with having buildings on an area, which isn't technically
necessary. So Caleb got there first.

Fun game, looking forward to playing it again.
