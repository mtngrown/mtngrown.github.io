S3 - Arvold variant - PanzerBlitz

April 27, 2014

German OOB:

Delete: 5 Pz IVh.
Add: 9 Pz IIIg, 1 Pz IIId, 2 Pz IVe, and 2 Pz IId.

Played this with Al S. at Endgame.

In fact, we played two games, I won both.

In the first game, Al split his forces, but didn't bring enough force to
bear in any one place to punch through.

In the second game, Al concentrated his forces well enough, but didn't
stop my reinforcements from moving across the board.

This is a very tough scenario for the Germans.
