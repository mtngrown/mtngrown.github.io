I called the game around the half way point when it became clear I had
absolutely no idea how to play the Skinnies defense. In fact, it seemed
hopelessly out of balance to me, in favor of the Terrans.

One critical blunder was not realizing occupation requirements to occupy
critical facilities, marauders were gaining a turn, which is pretty
critical as the Skinny movement factor is lower. Looking forward to more
plays.
