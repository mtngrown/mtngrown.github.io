Here's what went down:

1. Warmed up with a classic "Super CP" scenario,
defender with standard armor + Mark III, attacker
with Mark V (Huscarl!). I squeaked out a marginal
win by ramming the Combine CP on my last treads.

2. Train! (Game 1) Ok, we played it wrong, not
remembering that points are the point. I got the
train off the board at the cost of a lot of units.
Probably a marginal win for me. (we didn't count
VPs, more below)

3. Train again, swapping sides. Dave M took the
defense. As the attacker I tried to make an end
run to cut the track before the train entered, at the
hideous expense of most of my armor. This is where
I found out infantry transport in Ogreverse is not a
good primary tactic. Costs too much attack factor.
Result, at least tactical, probably decisive win for
Dave M. (This is where we found out we were sposed
to keep track of VPs, instead of whether the train
escaped east or not.)

4. Turns out both Dave M and I have The Final
Frontier, an empire building microgame based in
our solar system. We played 5 turns to learn the
rules. Initial impression: fun little game!
