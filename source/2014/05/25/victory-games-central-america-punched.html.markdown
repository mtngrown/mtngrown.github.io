All completely punched. It took about a week of punching out 50-100
counters at a time. The game has 780 counters, so that's non-trivial.

One benefit of punching and clipping counters is getting familiar with
both common counters, because there are so many of them, and uncommon
counters, because there are so few.

Here's a picture of the order of battle for Scenario 1:

I put the counters into their own ziploc bag for easy access for a quick
solo game. The full campaign runs 10-20 hours, which is not bad at
all for this size of game. Comparable titles such as Victory Game's
"Vietnam" can run 100-200 hours.

### Next step

The set up for Scenario 1 is really easy, but once it's set up, I'm very
sure I'll have no idea how what to do next. Since this is as much about
learning the rules, the next step should be combat. Even if it makes no
sense from a tactical point of view, learning the rules is pretty
important.
