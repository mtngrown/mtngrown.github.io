All completely punched. It took about a week of punching out 50-100
counters at a time. The game has 780 counters, so that's non-trivial.

One benefit of punching and clipping counters is getting familiar with
both common counters, because there are so many of them, and uncommon
counters, because there are so few.

Here's a picture of the order of battle for Scenario 1:

I put the counters into their own ziploc bag for easy access for a quick
solo game. The full campaign runs 10-20 hours, which is not bad at
all for this size of game. Comparable titles such as Victory Game's
"Vietnam" can run 100-200 hours.
