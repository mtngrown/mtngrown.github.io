A second round of solo play for Chadwick's *Battle for Moscow*.

Some details:

* More or less followed all the rules this time.
* Played out in about 90 minutes solo. This feels about right
  as I'm still working through ZOC tactics.
* The game went to a draw with the deciding dice roll on the last battle
  at 1:1 to retake Ryazan. With a 50% chance to retake Ryazan for a
  Russian win, I rolled a 6, attacker step loss. Bummer.

This turned out to be more or less a perfect solo game, with the
last roll of the game deciding it, and with 50% odds as well.

The mud really helps the Russians a lot.

Next, I need to figure out how to crack this game for the Germans.
I'm pretty sure I can fight it to a standstill as the Russians, every
time.
