Yesterday, May 31, 2014, I found myself at the local tabletop venue
a bit early, so I set up Situation #6 classic PanzerBlitz for some solo
play. My partner for the day was running very late, and didn't show up
until I was 5 turns in. At that point, I narrated the remainder of the
game to him as I finished it out solitaire. He's still learning the
rules, so it wasn't a big deal.

That was the tactical side.

On the strategic side, we set up Battle for Moscow. I played Russians.

I've played this game a couple of times solo, and had a pretty hard time
making a breakthrough as Germans. What my opponent did in this game is
pursue a number of 1:1 battles to break open a hole in my line, which I
did not anticipate. Hence, I did not pull any units back for zone
control. On his second turn, after combat, he had a straight shot to
Moscow! And he took it!

I managed to recapture Moscow (twice!) and was holding it at the end of
the game. Since I had another city as well, it was a win for me.

And a lesson that while 1:1 odds aren't that great for the attacker,
it can still be useful to attack at 1:1.

Today I got in a couple of games of Soviet Dawn. My goal was to use the
Reorganization Table, which I had not yet used in previous games. The
first game I lost on the political track pretty fast. I didn't score it.

The second game I was able to get the Reorg table into play, and managed
to score 27 points on a political victory, "Proud Soviet State."
