This is the second time I've had this set up. I wasn't able to get play
started the first set up. This time, the computer is next to the game
table, the reinforcements are laid out, errata is loaded in iPad for
convenience, and there is nothing else on my plate other than the
standard suite of the usual boring weekend chores. I should be able to
get through at least a couple of turns if not the whole 4 turn Scenario
1.


## Short overview

Each turn is composed of five phases:

1. Weather
2. Reinforcement
3. Air allotment
4. Activation
5. End of turn (bookkeeping)

Hexes represent about 10 kilometers of terrain.

Counters represent actual Order of Battle. This is really interesting to
me coming from games such as Chadwicks's, Battle for Moscow, PanzerBlitz
and Ogre, where the counters represent anonymous units.

1 movement point to leave EZOC. This is different from Battle for Moscow
where units can leave EZOC without penalty.

CRT is 2d6, and has both 3:2 and 2:3 odds columns. Column shifts induced
by terrain, etc. do not accumulate, apply only the maximum.

Finally, Mannstein repulsed this offensive, which would be a German win,
which looks pretty tough from the perspective of Turn 1.

Let's get started.

## Turn 1

Weather: die roll: 1. From the weather table on the map, the conditions
are Rain with Normal ground conditions. Each side is limited to one
Fighter and one Close Air unit.

No reinforcements on Turn 1.

Air allotments reduced according to weather.

Activation phase: time to "play ball" so to speak.

### SW Front: 1st Guards

First decision: move first or fight first?

Let's fight, try to take out 3rd Pz HQ, sitting in Lisichansk. Taking
Lisichansk is a VP for the Soviets as well. Hrm. Odds look crappy. Let's
have the 19th Security and 35th Guards apply themselves to the 19 Pz
division. Attack 9 against defense 5 is 3:2, across a minor river, shift
Left, 1:1, 2d6: 9, `-/R2`, that is, no effect on the attacker, and a 2
hex retreat by the 19th Panzer towards Karnyi Limon. The Russian choose
to advance into the vacated territory.

Ok, choosing SW Front to fight first was dumb. There are only a couple
of German unit adjacent, and the odds aren't all that good. Should have
moved first, then fought. Could have been much uglier for the Germans
Anyway, movement: pressure the Germans hard.

And draw another chit...

### German Cr/Rs Korps

Pull all units back towards Belgorod, putting GD in Belgorod. Units not
making the distance holed up in the woods to the northeast of Belgorod,
and hope very much not to be surrounded by Voronezh Front.

Blunder here: should have used KampfGroup FB to restore the
GrossDeutschland, but that would have left the GD further out though.

### 3rd Tank Army

Takes off after some nasty SS, surrounding the Fhr DR regiment.
4:1 Combat results in a step loss and 3 hex retreat. This was almost
surely overkill, but whatever.

### VF 69th Army

Very few units in range, I activated most of them with 3rd Tank.
Move first, take on KfG A hiding in the woods east of Belgorod
at 8 AF/ 3DF, 2:1, shift 1L, 3:2, roll 6: 6, which is 1 step loss for
attacker and retreat 2 for defender towards Belgorod.

## 3rd Panzer

Can't do much, with not too many units. Consolidated forces where
possible, but locked in by EZOCs everywhere.

### OKH

I need to blow some bridges, got the easternmost Donets bridge.
Otherwise moving all units as fast as possible to bridges to get them
blown up.

### Army Group Popov (APV)

I think I may have moved this unit on a different activation.

## After action report


### Blunders

When SW Front has the first chit draw, it should move, then fight. In
this game, I chose it to fight then move, and there wasn't much
available at good odds to fight.
