This is the second time I've had this set up. I wasn't able to get play
started the first set up. This time, the computer is next to the game
table, the reinforcements are laid out, errata is loaded in iPad for
convenience, and there is nothing else on my plate other than the
standard suite of the usual boring weekend chores. I should be able to
get through at least a couple of turns if not the whole 4 turn Scenario
1.


## Short overview

Each turn is composed of five phases:

1. Weather
2. Reinforcement
3. Air allotment
4. Activation
5. End of turn (bookkeeping)

Hexes represent about 10 kilometers of terrain.

Counters represent actual Order of Battle. This is really interesting to
me coming from games such as Chadwicks's Battle for Moscow, PanzerBlitz
and Ogre, where the counters represent anonymous units.

1 movement point to leave EZOC. This is different from Battle for Moscow
where units can leave EZOC without penalty.

CRT is 2d6, and has both 3:2 and 2:3 odds columns. Column shifts induced
by terrain, etc. do not accumulate, apply only the maximum.

Finally, Mannstein repulsed this offensive, which would be a German win,
which looks pretty tough from the perspective of Turn 1.

Let's get started.

## Turn 1

Weather: die roll: 1. From the weather table on the map, the conditions
are Rain with Normal ground conditions. Each side is limited to one
Fighter and one Close Air unit.

No reinforcements on Turn 1.

Air allotments reduced according to weather.

Activation phase: time to "play ball" so to speak.

### SW Front: 1st Guards

First decision: move first or fight first?

Let's fight, try to take out 3rd Pz HQ, sitting in Lisichansk. Taking
Lisichansk is a VP for the Soviets as well. Hrm. Odds look crappy. Let's
have the 19th Security and 35th Guards apply themselves to the 19 Pz
division. Attack 9 against defense 5 is 3:2, across a minor river, shift
Left, 1:1, 2d6: 9, `-/R2`, that is, no effect on the attacker, and a 2
hex retreat by the 19th Panzer towards Karnyi Limon. The Russian choose
to advance into the vacated territory.

Ok, choosing SW Front to fight first was dumb. There are only a couple
of German unit adjacent, and the odds aren't all that good. Should have
moved first, then fought. Could have been much uglier for the Germans
Anyway, movement: pressure the Germans hard.

And draw another chit...

### German Cr/Rs Korps

Pull all units back towards Belgorod, putting GD in Belgorod. Units not
making the distance holed up in the woods to the northeast of Belgorod,
and hope very much not to be surrounded by Voronezh Front.

Blunder here: should have used KampfGroup FB to restore the
GrossDeutschland, but that would have left the GD further out though.

### 3rd Tank Army

Takes off after some nasty SS, surrounding the Fhr DR regiment.
4:1 Combat results in a step loss and 3 hex retreat. This was almost
surely overkill, but whatever.

### VF 69th Army

Very few units in range, I activated most of them with 3rd Tank.
Move first, take on KfG A hiding in the woods east of Belgorod
at 8 AF/ 3DF, 2:1, shift 1L, 3:2, roll 6: 6, which is 1 step loss for
attacker and retreat 2 for defender towards Belgorod.

## 3rd Panzer

Can't do much, with not too many units. Consolidated forces where
possible, but locked in by EZOCs everywhere.

### OKH

I need to blow some bridges, got the easternmost Donets bridge.
Otherwise moving all units as fast as possible to bridges to get them
blown up.

### Army Group Popov (APV)

I think I may have moved this unit on a different activation.

Oh well.

Move, then fight.

Took the bridge at Lisichansk. That's bad for 3rd Panzer.

### 69th Army

Putting some pressure on units in the middle of the map. Lots of small
scale action, low odds, some attacker reduction, but also pushing
defender back.

### SS

This is just in time for the Germans, as they need to bring some units
closer in to shore up the defense. No combat on this activation, all
movement.

And that's it for Turn 1.

I haven't used any air or artillery yet. Those will get rolled in after
I get a good grip on the rest of the combat system.

Technically, I think the VF and SWF get two and three more activations,
respectively, but that just doesn't feel right at all to me. In fact, it
feels really broken, so I'm not going to play it that way. Essentially,
what it means is that the Russians get 2 moves for every 1 move the
Germans get. It would have been easier if they had printed more
counters, but the notion of mixing already drawn counters back into the
pool just feels wrong. It makes it a lot harder to learn the game
because these details have to be recorded somewhere.

I'm tempted to just give the Russians another full move after all the
counters are drawn, that would make it a lot easier to keep track of
everything.

## Turn 2

(June 8, 2013)

Game play is going very slow, time to stopwatch turns.

Weather: C/N, clear and normal. Good. Makes for easier game play.

Reinforcement: Russian 40th Army attached to the Voronezh Front, will
attempt to cut off Cr/Rs HQ units. German 3rd and 11th Pz divisions race
to the Donets to help cut some bridges.

Air allotment: not dealing with Air on this turn.

Activation...and off we go...

### Army Group Popov

AGP is Southwest Front. Just the worst possible pull for the Germans.
Moved everything within range to set up 4 battles:

1. German (defending):
    * (10) 320th Infantry
    * (3) KfG B

   Russian (attacking):

    * (3) 38th Guards (depleted)
    * (9) 4th Guards (armored)
    * (3) 11th Armor 
    * (4) 297th Infantry

   We're looking at 19:10, 3:2 on the odds table, roll 8: `-/R2`, and
   defenders are happy to occupy Izyum. That actually worked out well
   for the Germans.
 
   16 minutes in.

2. German (defending):
    * (8) 3rd Pz

   Russian (attacking):

    * (2) 195th division
    * (3) 178/10 armor brigade
    * (7) 3rd armor corps

    3:2 odds, roll 6, `1/R2`, eliminate the Russian 195th, Germans
    retreat to Kramatorskaya.

   21 minutes.

3. Russian (attacking):
    * (5) 35th Guards (X)
    * (2) 106 Infantry (X)
    * (3) 186/10 Armored (X)

   German (defending)

    * (7) 7th Pz (XX)

   9:7 is 1:1, roll 8: `1/R2`, Russian 106th eliminated, Germans retreat
   to Kramatorskaya.

   26 minutes.

4. Russian (attacking)
    * (4) 78th Infantry (XX)
    * (8) 18th Armored Corps (XXX)
    * (4) 52nd Infantry (XX)
    * (6) 57th Guards (XX)
    * (6) 41st Guards (XX)

   German (defending)

    * (2) 3rd Pz HQ
    * (4) 901 Lehr (|||)

   28:6 is 4:1, roll 7: `2R3` which eliminates both units. 

   32 minutes

   Crap. I've misplaced the AGP chit...was on the floor. Not good.


### 3rd Panzer

Eliminated from this turn by AGP. Bummer.


### SS Panzer

Pull everything within range behind the Donets, blow bridges:
5 attempts, 4 blown bridges, not bad. But I'm out of Blown
Bridge counters now, with several more bridges to go.

43 minutes.

### 40th Army (VF)

Reinforcements: move to the Borisovka area.

46 minutes.


### 69th Army (VF)

Attempt to interdict supply for German Cr/Rs units.

51 minutes.

### Cr/Rs

Move mechanized units around the north end of the Donets, attempt to
blow some bridges at Belgorod.

57 minutes.

### OKH

Which needs to move itself. Also, moved a bunch of units formerly with
3rd Pz.

Elapsed time: 1:04.

### 3rd Tank Army (VF)

Will try to cut off Belgorod from Kharkov.

Moved the armor up to Belgorod, all infantry possible along the Donets
because it takes a full move to cross a major river by infantrMoved the
armor up to Belgorod, all infantry possible along the Donets because it
takes a full move to cross a major river by infantry.

ET: 1:11

### 1st Guard Army (SWF)

Just moved some pieces, whole SWF is a mess, units everywhere, no clear
sense of which units should be controlled by which HQ.

ET: 1:16

### 6th Army (SWF)

Russians advance to outskirts of Izyum, attempt to take control from
German occupiers:

Russians (attacking):

* (3) 38th Guards (XX)
* (9) 4th Guards Armored (XXX)
* (4) 6th Infantry (XX)
* (2) 172d Infantry (XX)
* (4) 350th Infantry (XX)
* (3) 11th Armored (XX)
* (4) 267th Infantry (XX)

Germans: (defending)

* (3) KfG B
* (10) 320th Infantry (XX) 

Odds are 29:13, which is 2:1, Izyum shifts 1L for 3:2, roll: 7, `1/R2`.
Bummer, Izyum lost, but at least no step loss for Germans. Russian 172d
eliminated.

ET: 1:23.



### End of turn bookkeeping

#### Supply

All units are in supply.

#### Current victory conditions

Germans:

* 4 Russian units eliminated
* 11 cities held
* **15 total points**

Russians:

* 2 German units eliminated
* 1 city held
* **3 total points**

I'm starting to see where the double move for the Russians might be necessary.

Turn 2 went pretty fast as there was a lot more positioning and movement
than combat, and I'm not writing up the movements. Writing up movements
would take a much longer time.

Given the above, I should be able to play out a turn between 90 minutes
and two hours.

---

## Turn 3

This is where the Germans and the Russian SWF get loads of reinforcements.

This is several hours after finishing Turn 2, had stuff to do.

Setting the timer...and we're off again.

Weather: S/F, snow and frozen. No air, and rivers and marches freeze
over. This means the bridge blowing might have been a waste of time.
We'll see.

Reinforcement:

* German: Reinforcement rail roll: 1. Thule/Tkf SS coming at Poltova. 3rd Pz HQ 
  rail to Barvenkovo. 40th Pz enter at 3279, 3479.

* Russian: Reinforcement rail roll: 1. VF and SWF entering from their
  respective areas, nothing special to report.

Air allotment: no air, snowing.

Activation, time to start playing!

Elapsed time: 32 minutes due to a lot of rules reading.


### OKH

First up, send some units back to Zaporozhe, just in case the Russians
get a fast move to the west.

ET: 48 minutes

### 3rd Pz

Big fight around Izyum. Not going into detail, just the results:

1. 3:2, artillery +2, Russian retreat
1. 2:1, Russian retreat 2
1. 4:1, roll 5, Russian retreat 2.

### SS Pz

Move Pzs to Donets, attack Russian infantry at 4:1 with +2 artillery:
eliminate Russian 184th Infantry.

ET: 1:05

Running a bit behind Turn 2.

### Cr/Rs Korps

What is with pulling all the Germans all at once?

Unlikely, but what can you do?

Anyway, moved some units around to set up ZOCs and hopefully slow down
the onslaught.

ET: 1:10

### 1st Guard (SWF)

Some battles:

1. 2:1 on 11 Pz, `-/R2`
2. 2:3 on 333rd Infantry, +2 artillery: `1/-`, eliminate 38 Guards.

ET: 1:17

### APG

3:2 on 11 Pz, again, +2 artillery: `-/1R3`.

APG now splits off to go recapture Stalino.

ET: 1:21

### 40th Army

Move to encircle the Germans around Belgorod.

246/88 (|||) eliminated on 4:1 roll 3: `-/R2`, eliminated.

ET: 1:27

### 69th Army

Blows a hole in the line at the Donets, will be able to cross.

### 3TA

Exploits hole drilled by the 69th.

* 62d Guards attacks Fhr/DR at 3:1, shift for defender woods, 2:1 with
  some arty +2, roll 9: `-/1R2`.
* 111th occupies Chuguev, this is a VP for Russians.
* 3:1 on KfG A, roll 12, `-/2D2`, eliminated.
* 4:1 on KfG FB (mechanized), +2 artillery, roll 7+2: `-/2R3`
  eliminated.

ET: 1:43

### 40th Pz

All units within activation range already moved by OKH.

### 6th Army

All units in activation range already moved.

ET: 1:45


### End of turn bookkeeping

#### Supply

German: 167 and GD are Low Supply.

Russian units are in supply.

#### Victory points

Germans:

* 6 Russian units eliminated.
* 10 cities held
* **16 total points**

Russian:

## Turn 4

The last turn of Scenario 1.

It's getting on in the evening, how fast can I crank this out? I'd like
to have it off my table tonight.

Let's get started.

Weather: Clear/Frozen. So, air comes back but rivers are still frozen.

Reinforcements: Rail roll: brought 2 units into Kharkov for Germans,
roll 1 for Russians, will bring unit into Kazachia Lopam. 

Air allotment: the air rules still seem confusing, so not using them.

Activation...turn on the stopwatch.

### OKH

Again, the Germans kick off with OKH.

All movement, no combat, mainly getting units north and east as fast as
possible.

ET: 0:4

### AGP

52 Infantry now holding Stalino, +1 VP. Other units in AGP now moving
west.

ET: 0:6

### 40th Army

Germans are in trouble.  Belgorod is surrounded. GD is taken, no way to
retreat. The 167 is taken, no way to retreat. Hungarians and Cr/RS HQ is
taken. KfG F is taken.

This was a huge turn for the Russians.

ET: 0:21

### 3rd Pz

Moved HQ to the northwest, leaving remaining units under activation of
40 Pz.

Chuguev retaken, that's a VP back to the Germans.

ET: 0:26


### 1st Guards

Retreat elimination of one German unit, low odds attacks on other to no
effect.

ET: 0:34

### 69th Army

Going after some SS on the Donets. Picked off one of them, forgot to use
artillery, could have had both because they were boxed in.

ET: 0:39

### SS Pz

SS is almost eviscerated.  What it can do is help maintain supply for
remaining units. Forced a retreat of the 160th Infantry. Every little
bit helps.

ET: 0:43

### 3rd Tank Army

Only unit within range which can be activated is the 62 Guards, which is
going after 11th Pz at 2:3, attacker step loss. Try again next time.

ET: 0:45

### 40th Pz

Some attacks defending Izuym:

1. 333 attack 350 at 2:1, attacker step loss.
2. R2 on 1G.

Izyums stands for the Germans.

### Cr/Rs Korps

Already eliminated.

ET: 0:49

### End of turn bookkeeping

#### Supply

Irrelevant, last turn.

#### Victory points

Germans:

* 9 cities held
* 9 Russian units eliminated
* **18 total points**

Russians

* 3 cities held
* 7 German units eliminated
* 4 Sashed German units eliminated (x2)
* **18 total points**

This was a German win.

## After action report

The Germans have a hard time in this game, which is to be expected of
anyone insisting on invading Russia.

The mechanics seemed to be pretty straightforward, perhaps because for
any rules such as air and chit pulling which I didn't understand, I just
ignored and played what seemed to make sense.

It's surprising the Germans managed to hold on as long as they did. One
more turn and would be pretty ugly for the Germans though.

The Russians can do better by moving faster and attcking more at lower
odds to kick the Germans out of the cities for victory points.

I could probably say more, but it's time to wrap it up and get ready to
kick off the work week.


### Blunders

* When SW Front has the first chit draw, it should move, then fight. In
  this game, I chose it to fight then move, and there wasn't much
  available at good odds to fight.

* I've been activating whatever is in range with impunity. But the rules
  say that no combat unit can be actived more than once per game turn.
  So I have to remember from activation to activation which units have
  been previously activated.

* I've activating SS and regular units incorrectly.

* Did not use the double chit pull. Just doesn't make any sense to me as
  I'm activating everything possible on the initial chit pull. That is,
  there would not be any units to be activated even if I used the second
  chit pull.

### Questions

* Can one HQ unit activate movement for another HQ unit? The situation
  is where 1st Guards forgot to move along with its units, and is now
  "stranded" way behind the front. However, it could be "activated" by
  AGP to move to a more advantageous position.
