This afternoon's intent is to walk through the first turn of the first
scenario "Bloody March" of Victory Game's Central America.

Getting through Turn 1 will be enough achievement for a late afternoon:
Central America is the most complex game I've started working on. VG's
Viet Nam may be even more complex, but I have punched it out and started
reading the rules yet. However, since CA allows simulating a full-on
WWIII situation, it may indeed go beyond Vietnam.

Victory conditions: eliminate as many units as possible and occupy the
village of Las Vegas.

FDN has 4 insurgency points.

FSLN has 2 insurgency points.


## Turn 1

My first question: who has the first move? Inferring from the Phases
explanation, the Communist player always moves first.

Ok, it's not helping that it's Saturday afternoon, and I'm coming down
from my weekly caffiene binge. Body feels achy and dull, mind full of
cotton.

My intention was to play out just one turn using all the rules in every
phase for the turn.

I now think that's more than I want to handle. Instead, I'm considering
skipping all the rules except "move," and "shoot," and playing through
all five turns.

Still, this will require closer examination of the phases.

### FSLN phases

Scenario 1 uses standard rules, all the intervention rules phases are
ignored.

* Supply: all units in supply.
* Ground unit reorganization: no reorg points.
* Regular Ground Unit Movement: FSLN moves to encircle fortified
  position.
* Insurgency Movement: not going to worry about this.
* Insurgency Placement: not emplacing insurgents on this turn
* *Allied Aerial Counterinsurgency*: not playing this rule.
* First Insurgency Disbandment: not playing insurgent rules this turn.
* Air Mission: no air assets for FSLN in this scenario.
* Ground Combat: Attack FDN in fortified postion at odds 9:4, 2:1, roll
  4, -2 DRM defender advantage for fortification, attacker step loss.
* Reserve Movement: not playing reserve movement rules.
* Second Insurgency Disbandment: not playing insurgent rules this turn.
* Helicopter Transport: FSLN has no helicopters in this scenario.
* Return to Base: no helicopters.
* Reinforcement:
