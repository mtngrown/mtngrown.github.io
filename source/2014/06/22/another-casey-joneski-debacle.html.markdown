Apparently, Steve Jackson Game's Ogre Designers Edition (ODE for short)
is one of these things which a very large number of otherwise "serious"
wargamers have purchased, surreptitiously. I keep running into people
who bought a copy, but haven't yet played it. Even curiouser, I've
spoken with some of these same people in the past, and they haven't
mentioned that they, too, couldn't resist 28 lbs of Ogre-y delight.

In any case, three of us, Al, Andrew and I, met up at the local store to
get in a few games of ODE. Lately, we've focused on the train scenarios,
because they seem lopsided, which means none of us understand quite how
to play them.

Game 1: Me attacking Andrew. I split 15 GEVs, some to the east, some to
west, some up the middle. The GEVs which went up the middle got
slaughtered. The GEVs that went east, pretty much got slaughtered. To
the west, wasn't able to catch the train in time.

However, I did manage to sneak one GEV through the woods and cut the
train tracks, whence the train went off the eastern edge of the board.
Result, draw.

Game 2: Another Casey Joneski, Andrew taking on Al. Andrew took his GEVs
all the east and all the way west. After some tense moments, it turned
out to be a win for Andrew, as he diverted then destroyed the train, and
got 8 GEVs off the south edge. It was close though, coming down to a
couple of die rolls which would have taken out one last GEV to get a
draw. The lesson in this game is *never* count the infantry out until
the game is completely over.

Game 3: The Train scenario, Al attacking me as defender. I took a mobile
howitzer and two super heavies, the rest GEVs. Al made a hideous blunder
by leaving open a stack of GEVs early on, and the super heavy took out 3
of 5 right away, and another shortly thereafter. It went downhill for Al
after that.

In all, good times.
