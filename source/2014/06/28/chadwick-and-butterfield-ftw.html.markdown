Bloody Kasserine, Race for Tunis, Ambush all arrived on Thursday from a
forum purchase. They are all in pretty good physical shape, the boxes
bearing the brunt of the wear, as usual. Over the last couple of days,
I've spent some time to clean up the counters by trimming and clipping.
They look great!

Bloody Kasserine and Race for Tunis are GDW Frank Chadwick games,
featuring simple rules, reasonably low counter density (176 counters
in each game), and relatively short playing time, which I'm estimating
about 3 hours for experienced players. Kasserine was an impulse
purchase. It turns out Race for Tunis can attach to form a larger
campaign game, and the seller discounted for buying both.

Ambush is the Victory Game's Butterfield solitaire tactical game, which
has an excellent reputation. I've wanted it for a while. The seller for
Kasserine just happened to have this for sale as well, and I couldn't
resist it.

What's even cooler is that each of these games is open and punched.
That's cool because I tend not to open games which are in shrink.
I have plenty of "opened" games it just seems wasteful to tear the
shrink off a game unless I'm ready to play it immediately.

The downside of buying used games is I feel compelled to inventory the
game immediately, and trim and corner the counters. This is mindless
work to be sure, but I'm thinking I ought to find a way to limit the
corner rounding to say, work day evenings.
