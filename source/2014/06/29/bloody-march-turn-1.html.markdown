Now that it's a week after my [initial aborted attempt at playing
Bloody March](/2014/06/21/bloody-march-first-turn.html),
let's give Bloody March another try with the full rule set.

## Turn 1

Back to business. I don't see any way around going through each phase in
gruesome detail. That's the best I've found to learn for myself, even if
it is the most boring.

### FSLN phases

Scenario 1 uses standard rules, all the intervention rules phases are
ignored.

* Supply: all FSLN units in supply, by definition all units are
  considered to be in supply on the first game turn unless the scenario
  dictates otherwise. (In the this scenario, the Honduran 4th regiment
  at Mandasta is out of supply until the start of Game Turn 4).
  Since there are no Supply Depots available, Communist supply phase is
  over.

* Ground unit reorganization: no reorg points, skip.

* Regular Ground Unit Movement: FSLN moves to encircle fortified
  position. Note that this is only the regular forces, insurgents
  can move on this phase as regular units, or the next phase as
  insurgent units. Details:
    * NI 50-02 X moves from 2311 to 2310 Las Trojes. This is within the
    ZOC of the FDN forces on 2410 (Las Vegas), so it requires the entire
    movement allowance (normally 4).
    * NI Lopz X moves from 2511 to 2510, again, a single hex due to FDN
    ZOC centered on 2410. This concludes FSLN regular movement.


* Insurgency Movement: as it turns out, I could have just moved the
  current insurgents during regular movement phase, as I don't need to
  leverage the "insurgent reserve." But since I didn't move them during
  regular movement, I'll move them now:
    * NI Pom II: from 2511 to 2510. I could move further as insurgents
      aren't bound by ZOCs, but that's where I want it anyway.
      Insurgency Reserve status marked. Note that the insurgent unit
      doesn't have to pay normal movement costs.
    * NI Uman II: from 2411 to 2310, leveraging the ability to move
      through the Allied ZOC with impunity. Insurgency Reserve status
      marked.


* Insurgency Placement: I think this is a good idea, because FSLN have
  only 2 insurgency points against FDN 4, and needs to get as much combat
  as fast as possible:
    * First attempt is to emplace regiment of MRH (an attractive yellow
      colored counter). Costs 1 insurgency point to make the attempt.
      Die roll 4, +1 for placing in home country, success for forest
      placement at hex 2411.
    * Since insurgent units are considered support units for stacking
      purposes, let's try to place another one at 2411: Die roll 5,
      success and an MRP unit enters the game.

  Neither of these units can move this turn, but they can fight.


* *Allied Aerial Counterinsurgency*: The successful placements are bad
   for the Allies. Unfortunately, 3 Bombardment points are necessary to
   undertake an Aerial Counterinsurgency, so the CIA helicopter stays
   home (in Silca).

* First Insurgency Disbandment: will keep insurgents this turn for
   fighting.

* Air Mission: no air assets for FSLN in this scenario.

* Ground Combat: FSLN attacks FDN in fortified postion 2410:
    * Attacking:
      * (2) Lopz from 2510
      * (2) 50 02 from 2310
      * (2) Veng from 2411
      * (1) Uman 2310
      * (1) Pom from 2510
      * 8 total attack

    * Defending FDN from entrenchment:
      * (2) Leg
      * (2) Cim
      * 4 total defend

      Odds 8:4, 2:1, roll 3, -2 DRM defender advantage for fortification,
      +1 DRM for attacking insurgent, result 2 yeilds attacker step loss
      with no retreat. That's actually not bad. *Veng* takes the step loss.

    Note that I'm assuming that the entrenchment forces combined defense
    as a stack. If this is not the case, a better attack would be 4:1,
    which would give a 2/3 chance of defender step loss and retreat. In
    this case, that would be an elimination. Except! Defenders in a
    fortification or entrenchment can ignore retreats.

    Rules clarification: Each of these units may be attacked separately,
    but they both have to be attacked. That is, the rules specify that
    if a unit in a hex is attacked, all the units in that hex must be
    attacked, but each unit may be attacked independently.

    A better attack may have been to attempt to get a 3:1 on one unit
    and a 1:1 on another. This would have almost certainly resulted in
    an attacker step loss (perhaps more than one), but it would have a
    higher probability of a defender step loss as well.

* Reserve Movement: Since the FDN *Leg* and *Cim* units have only 1 AF,
  I'll move the NI *Uman* from 2310 and *Pom* from 2510 to 2409, which will be
  punishing on FDN supply next turn. Reserve markers removed.

* Second Insurgency Disbandment: keeping insurgents this turn.

* Helicopter Transport: FSLN has no helicopters in this scenario.
  Bummer.

* Return to Base: no helicopters.

* Reinforcement: No reinforcements.


### FDN phases

* Supply: Turn 1 all units considered in supply unless dictated
otherwise by the scenario.

* Ground unit reorganization: No reorganization points.

* Regular Ground Unit Movement: The FDN *Leg* and *Cim* regiments need
to stay put in Las Vegas, that's victory ground after all. This leaves
the Honduran unit:
    * HN *4* moves 2 hexes along road from 1811 to 1910.

* Insurgency Movement: the *Salz*, *Sjec* and *Seg* insurgent units:
    * The insurgents move from 2612 to 2511, reserve marker placed.

* Insurgency Placement: Definitely need some insurgents here. FDN has 4
  points to spend:

  * First attempt, emplace *FRDA* at 2511. Roll 1, +1 DRM for home country,
    unsuccessful. Down to 3 IP. Try again...
  * Second attempt, emplace *Qui* at 2511, roll 1, unsuccessful.  Again...
  * Third attempt: *MLN* at 2511, roll 1, no dice.
  * Fourth attempt: *Cond* at 2511, roll 6, success.

  Well, that surely sucked for the Allied forces, considering the +1
  provided about an 83% chance of success. Three 1s in row. Sheesh.

* *FSLN Aerial Counterinsurgency*: ain't got no wings, so there's no
  aerial counterinsurgency.

* First Insurgency Disbandment: not disbanding any insurgents this turn.

* Air Mission: FDN has CIA helicopter support. How shall these allows
  employ this asset? Three options for this bird:
    1. Air to ground combat, seems to be covered by the Bombardment
       rules.
    2. Close air support, requires ground combat on same target.
    3. Transport.

  In this case, close air support of ground combat is warranted. Since
  there is no other air asset, a +1 Close Air Support marker is placed
  on *Lopz* at 2510, as this is the unit coming under Allied attack.

* Ground Combat, one attack, as follows:
  * On the attack:
    * (1) *SJec* from 2610
    * (1) *Salz* from 2610
    * (1) *Cond* from 2511
    * (1) *Cim* from 2410
    * (1) *Leg* from 2410
    * (1) CIA helicopter
    * 6 Total

  * Defending:
    * (3) *Lopz* at 2510

  Odds 6:3 yeild 2:1, defender is leg unit in forested terrain, roll 2,
  +1 for Close Air Support, +1 for insurgent unit attacking, one column
  shift right for attack helicopter, from CRT value 4 yeilds `-/1,R`
  defender step loss and retreat to 2408. Not bad, *Lopz* is a powerful unit.

  Attacker chooses not to pursue, as the leg units would be giving up a
  lot of defensive strength in the entrenched hex, and insurgency
  reserve move can occupy that area anyway.

* Reserve Movement:
  * *SJec* and *Seg* from 2610 to 2510
  * *Salz* from 2610 to 2511

* Second Insurgency Disbandment: Keeping the single unit activated.

* Helicopter Transport: mission already flown in CAS.

* Return to Base: helicopter back to Silca.

* Reinforcement: no reinforcements in this scenario.


Ok, that's it for Turn 1, and we're talking hours of work. Here's a
snapshot, blurry from mobile phone but still useful:

{:.center}
![Bloody March end of Turn
1](/images/bloody_march_turn_1_cropped_resized.jpg)


Score: FDN 4, FSLN 0.

This is the FDN's game to lose, by dint of setting up on the Las Vegas
village for 4 VPs.

Play continues with [Bloody March
Turn 2](/2014/07/27/bloody-march-turn-2.html).
