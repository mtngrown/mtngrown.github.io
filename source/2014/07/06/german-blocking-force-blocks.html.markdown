I've had PanzerBlitz Situation #9 set up for several days.
Motivation has been low, the scenario looked really ugly
and was difficult for me to initially set up. It looks
like an absolute cakewalk for the Russians.

But it's not.

It turns out to be a pretty good scenario after all.

In fact, the Germans won it 26 to 18, which is draw.

Both sides played pretty well, the Germans could have
done better with field guns, and the Russians could have
protected their transport better.

This game was part of my goal to play out all the original
PanzerBlitz scenarios twice, solo. I'd like to get another
two plays on each scenario with an opponent, one play as
Russian, one as German. We'll see how that goes.
