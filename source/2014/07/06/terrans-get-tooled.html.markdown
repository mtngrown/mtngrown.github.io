Got in a quick game of Starship Troopers, Scenario 1, this time played
correctly.

Here's the set up for the Skinnies:

![Skinny set up for Scenario
1](/images/starship-troopers/scenario_1_setup.jpg)

This picture is terrible, it was at night with an old iPhone camera. At
some point I'll replace it. Regardless of the picture quality the
important thing is the positioning for the Skinnies, which is shown
clearly enough.

The idea is set up all the targets behind a defensive line along the
road, where the Skinnies get road bonus moving from strong point to
string point.

## Terrans all over the map

The Skinnies had the Terran forces running all over the map.

Final score was Humanoids 29, Terrans 25.

And this is with unavoidable "intelligence" attempting to play both
sides fairly solitaire. I think this could be pretty hard to win as the
Terrans, against someone who really has it together playing the
Humanoids in Scenario 1.

Shouldn't be too hard to handicap though, just reduce decoys and
workers. Alternatively, with a powerful Terran player, add decoys and
workers.

Pretty good game, really. The only thing I found kind of wack was
massive counter stacking, but I understand this was not uncommon in '70s
era games. And it makes sense given this game and the unit scale.
