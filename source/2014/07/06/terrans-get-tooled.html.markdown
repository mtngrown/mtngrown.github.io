Got in a quick game of Starship Troopers, Scenario 1, this time played
correctly.

Final score was Humanoids 29, Terrans 25.

And this is with unavoidable "intelligence" attempting to play both
sides fairly solitaire. I think this could be pretty hard to win as the
Terrans, against someone who really has it together playing the
Humanoids in Scenario 1.

Shouldn't be too hard to handicap though, just reduce decoys and
workers. Alternatively, with a powerful Terran player, add decoys and
workers.

Pretty good game, really. The only thing I found kind of wack was
massive counter stacking, but I understand this was not uncommon in '76
era games. And it makes sense given the game and unit scale.
