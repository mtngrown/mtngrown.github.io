Played a couple of games of "Last Train Out" from the ODE scenario book.
First game defending, playing Steve K. I set to block GEV offense, which
left me open to Steve's 10 Super Heave offense. A bad tactical move on
my part and a string of unlucky die rolls, and it was a TKO.

I did better on offense, taking 10 GEV and 20 LGEV. We called it a draw
as we lost track of turns, and either on Turn 9, 10 or 11, I overran the
train just as or after it pulled out. My forces got slaughtered, but all
I needed was to stop the train.

Seems like a fairly well balanced scenario.
