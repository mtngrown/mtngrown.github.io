Finished up game 2 of PanzerBlitz Situation #9. It was a decisive German
victory.

This was largely due to 3 factors:

1. The Russians entered in road march order, which allowed some
   immediate German action to eliminate truck transports.

2. The Russians attempted to take the "fast road" through Bednost,
   which is the obvious thing, but had to tread lightly as the Germans
   emplaced a pair of 75mm ATGs. That hill top is just small enough
   to put enemy armor into the doubled AF range.

3. The Germans were able to move some units to block the exit road
wrapping around Hill 135. This was a huge Russian blunder, and may
have been a result of losing track of the turn counter.

Overall, as mentioned in the writeup for the first game of Situation #9,
it feels fairly well-balanced, but it demands a high level of skill to
play either side effectively. For the Germans, getting the initial
emplacement is critical. For the Russians, slowing down to fight is
probably a mistake, except that the victory conditions require a certain
number of German eliminations.

Overall, good game. I've had it on the table all week, and was able to
get through the first five turns during the week, and finished up it
today.
