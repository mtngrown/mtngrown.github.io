Got in a fast game of Soviet Dawn, going for the military win nowadays.
Political win I've managed several times. This game went half way
through the Dark deck, ending on card 13 with an Eastern Front
advance into Moscow, a military defeat.

Score, count cards not in discard pile: 23, Strategic Defeat.

Some notes:

* Played bukharin option.

* Early reorg roll yielded armored trains, providing +1 for one offensive per
turn, very useful after Mannerheim was activated.

* Did not use any reserve offensives! Big blunder, could have surely
managed a marginal defeat with score 22.

Not employing reserves was the biggest blunder of the game.

Here's a question on the rules: if an event card allows removing a front
during that turn, does the front need to be in the further box at the
start of the turn when the card is drawn, or can the front removal apply
at the end of the turn if the front is driven to its last box?
Regardless of any official ruling, an end-of-turn application should
provide a slight advantage, and might be fun to use an optional rule
in any case.
