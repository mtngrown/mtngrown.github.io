Final Frontier boasts a 60 turn track, which is not tenable for a quick
solitaire play. What is tenable is setting up a 2 faction game, writing
out a couple of turns in detail, and recording the status after a couple
of turns such that the game can be picked up later.

It should be noted that the turns do go fairly quickly; there's not that
much to do on any particular turn.

For this game, the two factions are Magenta (M) and Chartreuse (C).

Before the turn sequencing starts, factions are allocated a 10 "build
points" (BPs), with several options for spending BPs before play:

* Purchase turn sequence
* Purchase increased National Interest (NI)
* Build a mine
* Increase Gross National Product (GNP)

Basically, anything costing 10 points or less is fair game, although
buying a 10 point unit of Marines is probably not efficient at the start
of the game.

## Setting up

Planets:

* Mars 0224
* Earth 0325
* Jupiter 0724
* Uranus 0608
* Neptune 1703

Magenta:

* 2 NI increases at 5 points each.

Chartreuse:

* 1 game turn lead for 2 BP
* 1 NI increase for 5 BP
* 15 increase in GNP for 3 BP

In related activity, much time was spent reading rules, and starting a
personal FAQ sheet for the game. Writing out questions, then answering
them is a great way to learn, just takes longer initially.

And that's all for now, the work day tomorrow beckons, need to get
organized to hit the ground running, first thing in the morning, with
the game face on (and other cliches).
