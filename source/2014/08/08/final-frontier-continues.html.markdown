Finding time to play a complete game of anything lasting more than
30 minutes is increasingly more difficult these days. Hence, being
able to record positions, tear down, and reset an ongoing game allows
more games to be played in smaller time increments. I enjoy pushing
cardboard too much to use computer-ported (VASSAL) games.

From last week's [Final Frontier set
up](/2014/08/03/final-frontier-setting-up-and-starting.html), we
continue the game, starting from Turn 1 for real.

## Turn 1

Chartreuse:

* Economic phase:
  * Builds 1 mine, emplaces on Moon for 2 BP total, 1 BP left over.

Magenta:

* Economic phase:
  * Builds 1 mine, emplaces on Moon for 2 BP total, 1 BP left over.

Not much going on in the early stages of the game. This is noted in the
rules, with the promise that chaos breaks out once enough activity
occurs.

## Turn 2

Chartreuse:

* Economic phase:
  * No income yet, Moon is inhospitable.
  * Accrue 3 build points for 4 total.
  * Build mine for 2 BP.
  * Mine to Mercury for 1 BP.

Magenta:

* Economic phase:
  * No income yet, Moon is inhospitable.
  * Accrue 3 build points for 4 total.
  * Build mine for 2 BP.
  * Mine to Mercury for 1 BP.
  * 1 BP remaining. * 1 BP remaining.

Status:

  * Chartreuse: mines on Moon and Mercury (not producing next turn).
  * Magenta: mines on Moon and Mercury (not producing next turn).

So far, both factions seem like-minded. This will likely change as
Magenta has an advance on NI, and is set to increase travel speed
before Chartreuse. We'll see how it goes.

Planets:

* Mars: 0325
* Earth: 0326
* Jupiter: 0724

I'm writing out notes on the rules as I go, so these turns are moving
very slowly.
