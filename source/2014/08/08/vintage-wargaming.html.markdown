Why play wargames which are 20, 30 or even 40 or more years old?

Many reasons could be given, but the most important reason is
many of these games are still fun to play!

The state of the art has advanced considerably, in all respects.
Computers have provided sophisticated graphical design tools,
manufacturing techniques have greatly improved, and the fundamental
mechanics of modern games probably, on average, are better than
most vintage games.

From what I understand, until recently, older games of all sorts
could be acquired cheaply on EBay, second hand shops and related
venues. Within the last couple of years, prices for many older
games have skyrocketed.

However, a large number of excellent games are still available
for anyone making even cursory effort, and relatively inexpensively.
Considering the cost of a new wargame, with hundreds of counters
and one or more mounted mapboards, the original purchase price
of $10-$12 seems like a great deal, even if the used price is
$20-$30.

## How to get older games cheap

It's not that difficult. Look for games for which:

* All the pieces are punched.
* Box has considerable wear.
* If you can find scanned copies of rules, counters, maps or
  other game pieces, it's sometimes possible to find *mostly*
  complete games for cheap.

This strategy works for me because once I take interest in a particular
game, I don't mind buying a couple of battered copies and bashing a
playable set together (with spares!). For example, I have three copies
of PanzerBlitz. While it turns out that two of the boxes are in pretty
good shape, the third box is battered and taped together. This is the
box I actually play. (It also turns out the all three copies were
complete when I received them, a grateful surprise.)


## Punched or unpunched?

Another benefit of buying used games already punched is you don't
have to punch them. I have a copy of Victory Game's *Viet Nam 1965
1975* which I can't bring myself to punch. Consequently, I'm looking
for a couple of cheap copies which may or may not be complete.

The best of both worlds here is "partially punched," because it's
easy to determine whether any counters are missing, and being
partially punched is license to complete punching it out.


## Playing vintage wargames

* Record keeping: I've taken to stocking most of my older games
with a couple of cheap mechanical pencils and a pad or two of
Post-It notes. Neither take up a lot of space, and having a scratch
pad handy for calculations is indispensible.

* Players aids: may or may not extensive, but if they are extensive, you
have a related problem: game playing space.

* Physical space. Where to put everything? Some of these older games
just take up a *lot* of space.

If you find a game you like, and you can get inexpensive copies, or
find "print and play" components, seriously consider annotating and
modifying your game to fit your taste. Obviously, this isn't something
you would want to do with a brand new game which may have considerable
resale value, but your second or third copy of game won't have much
resale value in any case.

## More benefits

Good vintage games acquire a community of dedicated players, and quite
often, a raft of player aids, new scenarios, counters, etc. For example,
the PanzerBlitz series of games has hundreds of community created
counters, and dozens of different maps.
