The Final Frontier is sort of addictive, I can play a few turns of
solo in an hour, and even write them up. Continuing from the weekend,
here's Turn 8 and more.

## Turn 8

Chartreuse:

* Income: Mercury C2 2 x 5; Moon C2 2 x 4; Mars M1 5: 23 total
* GNP: 115 + 23 = 138
* NI: 3
* BP: 6
* Spend: Launch M1 from Earth, 1 BP; build C2 on Earth, 4 BP.

Space movement: inactive M1 to 0426

Magenta:

* Income: 23
* GNP: 123
* NI: 4
* BP: 6
* Spend: Mine to Asteroid 1 BP, build C2 on Earth, 4 BP.

Space movement: M1 (inactive) to 0525


Planets:

* Earth: 0326
* Mars: 0126
* Jupiter: 0121
* Saturn: 1220
* Uranus: 0809
* Neptune: 1703

Status:

* Chartreuse: M1 (inactive) 0426; Mercury C2, Earth C2; Moon C2; Mars M1
* Magenta: M1 (inactive) 0525; Mercury C2; Earth C2; Moon C2; Mars M1.

The strategies are just now starting to diverge, where Magenta has used
the faster movement to get a Mine into the Asteroid Belt before
Chartreuse. Magenta is still spending to get that C2 on to Mars, will
probably shoot for the C3 build on Turn 10 or 11.

## Turn 9

Chartreuse:

* Income: Mercury C2 2 x 5; Moon C2 2 x 4; Mars M1 5: 23 total
* GNP: 115 + 23 = 138
* NI: 3
* BP: 6
* Spend: Launch C2 for Mars 1 BP; build M1 on Earth 2 BP, launch M1 to
  Asteroid Belt 1 BP.

Deep space: M1 (inactive) to 0223, M1 (inactive) to 0526, C2 to Mars.


Magenta:


* Income: Mercury C2 2 x 5; Moon C2 2 x 4; Mars M1 5: 23 total
* GNP: 100 + 23 = 123
* NI: 4
* BP: 6
* Spend: Activate M1 on 0525 2 BP; launch C2 for Mars 1 BP.

  Magenta has more BP remaining than Chartreuse.

Deep space: Move C2 to Mars.


Planets:

* Earth: 0226
* Mars: 0126
* Jupiter: 0121
* Saturn: 1221
* Uranus: 0809
* Neptune: 1703

Status:

* Chartreuse: Mercury C2; Moon C2; Mars C2; inactive M1 on 0526 and 0223.
* Magenta: Mercury C2; Moon C2; Mars C2; active M1 0525.

Magenta will leverage increased movement from higher NI to score some
Asteroid income next turn.


## Turn 10

Chartreuse:

* Income: Mercury 2 x 5, Moon 2 x 4; Mars 2 x 5; 28 total
* GNP: 115 + 28 = 143
* NI: 3
* BP: 7 + 3
* Spend: C3 on Earth and launch to Mars, 10 BP.

Deep space: move C3 to Mars.

Random events: roll 6:2 + 3 NI, 9:2, espionage. Take Magenta's
M! at 0525.


Magenta:

* Income: Mercury 2 x 5, Moon 2 x 4; Mars 2 x 5; 28 total
* GNP: 100 + 28 = 128
* NI: 4
* BP: 6 + 4
* Spend: C3 on Earth, launch to Mars, 10 BP.

Deep space, move C3 to Mars.

Random events: roll 2:4 + 4 NI, 6:2, No Effect. Dammit.

Magenta got screwed here, there was only a 1/6 chance of not
getting enough income for that extra build point which would
continue to carry over turn by turn. Definitely bad luck for
Magenta, and great luck for Chartreuse.


Planets:

* Earth: 0126
* Mars: 0125
* Jupiter: 0220
* Saturn: 1221
* Uranus: 0809
* Neptune: 1803

Status:

* Chartreuse: Mercury C2; Moon C2; Mars C3; M1 (inactive) in 0526, 0222
* Magenta: Mercury C2; Moon C2; Mars C3; M! destroyed!

Magenta may need to rethink. Chasing Chartreuse may not be the best
strategy, but it's not clear what a better strategy might be.


## Summary for the evening

Not a bad hour's worth of play. This game could go really fast with
experienced players.
