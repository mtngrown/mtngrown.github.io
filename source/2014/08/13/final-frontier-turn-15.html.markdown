Cranked out 5 turns of The Final Frontier last night, putting me through
the end of Turn 15. Notable events include Chartreuse getting that
Colony 4 emplaced on Mars ahead of Magenta, and eliminating *another*
of Magenta's mines in the ensuing Random Events roll. In response to
this, Magenta spent all saved build points populating the Asteroid Belt
with more mines, got a mine placed on Europa, and will emplace a Colony
2 on Europa on Turn 16. This should help reduce the GNP disparity
Magenta has been suffering from, as Chartreuse has to play catch-up on
the Jovian.

It seems to be allowed in the rules to move mines after being replace by
colonies, provided the appropriate build points for transport are paid.
There might be a good house rule here charging 1 BP to decommission a
mine, and another BP to recommission it.

Here's the state of the Solar System:

Chartreuse:

* Income: Mercury 2 x 5 + Moon 2 x 4 + Mars 3 x 5 + Mines 5 + 4 + 2 + 1
= 50
* GNP: 115 + 50 = 165
* NI: 5
* BP: 11 + 1
* Spend: M1 Mars 2 BP and launch 1 BP; M1 Earth and launch 2 + 1 BP;
activate M1 0525 2 BP = 8 BP, 4 BP carry over.

Deep space: M1 to 0525, M1 from Mars to 0423.

Magenta:

* Income: Mercury 2 x 5 + Moon 2 x 4 + Mars 2 x 5 + Mines 5 + 1 + 2 + 1
+ 5 = 47
* GNP: 100 + 47 = 147
* NI: 5
* BP: 9
* Spend: Activate 0323 2 BP; build C2 Earth and launch 4 + 1 BP; 7 BP
spent, 2 carry over.

Deep space: M1 to Europa, C2 to 0422.


Status:

* Chartreuse: Mercury C2, Moon C2, Mars C4, Active M1 on 0123, 0222,
0322, 0525, 0526, M1 deep space to Europa 0422.
* Magenta: Mercury C2, Moon C2, Mars C3, Europa M1, active M1 on 0123,
0222, 0323, 0524, 0525, 0526; C2 deep space to Europa on 0422.

Summary: Magenta's intended strategy of moving up the NI chart is being
confounded by Chartreuse's ability to outbuild and dice luck. Hence,
Magenta switching to building a lot more to generate revenue, and
protect against the loss of a mine given another unlucky espionage
event.
