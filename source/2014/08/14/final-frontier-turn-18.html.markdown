This is the last turn of "Game 1.5" as Chartreuse seems to be in a
runaway leader situation. This is partly due to the initial purchase
decisions, but I think mostly due to luck, which I'll document in detail
below.

(Game "0.5" was a 5 turn game played with someone else.)

But first, let's get the stats down for this turn.

Chartreuse:

* Income: Mercury 10, Moon 8, Mars 20, Europa 8, Ganymede 1, AB
  5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 68
* GNP: 115 + 68 = 183
* NI: 5
* BP: 14 + 8
* Spend: Build C2 on Earth and launch to Jupiter: 5 BP, 17 carryover.
* Deep space: C2 on 0523, M1 0824.

Magenta:

* Income: Mercury 10, Moon 8, Mars 15, Europa 8, Ganymede 6, Callisto 3,
  AB 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 64
* GNP: 100 + 64 = 164
* NI: 5
* BP: 11 + 9
* Spend: Colony 4 on Earth launch to Mars, 17 BP, 3 carry over.
* Deep space: M1 to 1125
* Random events: roll 3:3 for 8:3, NI - 1.


Status:

Chartreuse: Mercury C2, Moon C2, Mars C4, Europa C2, Ganymede M1, AB
fully occupied with M1, C2 in transit to Jupiter in 0523, M1 in transit
to Saturn in 0824.

Magenta: Mercury C2, Moon C2, Mars C4, Europa C2, Ganymede C2, Callisto
M1, all AB occupied, M1 in transit to Saturn in 1125.

## After Action Report

I'm conceding this game as Magenta, too much bad luck has let Chartreuse
pull too far ahead. Here's how the cookie crumbled:


Turn | NI Chartreuse | NI Magenta | RE | ABC | ABM
1 | 3 | 2 | none | 0 | 0
2 | 3 | 2 | none | 0 | 0
3 | 3 | 2 | none | 0 | 0
4 | 3 | 2 | none | 0 | 0
5 | 3 | 2 | Magenta: no effect | 0 | 0
6 | 4 | 2 | none | 0 | 0
7 | 4 | 3 | Chartreuse: no effect | 0 | 0
8 | 4 | 3 | none | 0 | 0
9 | 4 | 3 | none | 0 | 0
10 | 4 | 3 | Magenta: no effect, Chartreuse: destroy Magenta M1 | 0 | 0
11 | 5 | 4 | none | 0 | 0
12 | 5 | 4 | none | 5 + 2 | 0
13 | 5 | 4 | none | 6 + 3 + 3 + 1 | 6 + 3 + 1
14 | 5 | 4 | Chartreuse: destroy Magenta M1 | 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 | 3 + 2
15 | 5 | 5 | none | 5 + 4 + 2 + 1 | 5 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 1
16 | 5 | 5 | none | 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 | 6 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 1
17 | 5 | 5 | none | 6 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 | 5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1
18 | 5 | 5 | Magenta: NI - 1 | 5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 | 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1


The combination starting second with less GNP, losing mines on random
events, and frankly, mostly bad die rolls puts Magenta in a bit of hole.

If this were a 4 player game, as Magenta, I would probably sit back and
let the others play "bash the leader" while I worked at building
production capacity, and trying very hard to maintain a lead in NI.

As this game unfolded, the 1 point lead in NI was not enough to offset
Chartreuse's initial choices and luck.

My plan was to play this one out to either 60 turns or 300 GNP,
whichever came first, modulo World War event. What I'll do instead
is close this game here, and pick it back up at Turn 19 assuming
Magenta rolled a NI + 1 on the random events roll. That should help
even it up a bit.
