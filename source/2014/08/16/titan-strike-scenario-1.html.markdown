Played Scenario 1 with CC. Interesting little game. We definitely borked
it up in several ways, including getting Hopper movement initially
wrong, and getting the ranged combat and movement phases in the wrong
order.

I ended up winning it 77 to 59. Will play again. This is one that would
work well with the Ogre crowd I think.
