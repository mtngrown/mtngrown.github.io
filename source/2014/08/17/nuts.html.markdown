Nuts! is the last scenario in the Ogre Designer Edition Scenario book.
It has the interesting feature of using the round numbered counters for
establishing "camoflaged" positions, where the unit corresponding to the
number is recorded privately on a sheet of paper. Then, the unit is
exposed only when it moves or fires, or when it's fired on.

The three of us, AS, DM and I played two games. I kept score for the
first game while AS attacked DM on defending. None of us had ever played
this scenario, this is what we learned:

* Lasers and strongpoints get double strength points in forest and
towns. DM has these in the clear. Not good.
* Defenders can move off the map to the north, there is probably no
reason to move defensive units south to engage.
* Defender needs to have an exit plan.
* Good dice rolling helps.

The second game I played DM as defender, who attacked from the north in
a deep front. Too deep in fact, as I was able to pick off his lead
elements as they came into range, with nothing on my flanks or rear.
DM wasn't able to get all his units into play during any turn in the
game, reflected by the score Defender 178, Attacker 80.

The lesson here is "don't bunch up."
