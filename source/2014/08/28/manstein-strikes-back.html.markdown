After rotating a number of games on and off the table without even
setting them up, I finally got a bug to do Scenario 2 in Duel on the
Steppe. I had a pretty good time playing [Scenario
1](/2014/06/07/duel-on-the-steppe.html), and I'd like to eventually play
Scenario 3, which is scenarios 1 and 2 played back to back. So it's a
good time to work through Scenario 2.

Also, I'm on PTO from work, so I have some time, even though I seem to
feel super tired at the moment.

## Setting up

The setup, as usual for simulation-type games, take a while. Need to
find the current units, then emplace the correctly on the map. It's
smart to lay out all the reinforcements as well.

Once it's set up, this scenario looks pretty grim for the Germans. Hard
to see how they are going to acheive many victory points, given that
they're already behind, and have to get far, far ahead.

## Highlights

These are some brief notes, don't have time or inclination to do a
blow-by-blow this evening.

### Turn 5

Looks very, very grim for the Germans, as nearly all of the
Russian units activated before any of the German units.

### Turn 6

The Germans got lucky twice this turn, by having most of their units
activated before the Russians got going. Almost turning into IGOUGO.

This was the first piece of luck.

The second piece of luck was some lady in a humoguous RV tried to turn
around in the cul-de-sac and crunched a neighbor's car. I raced out
there to move my car before it got crunched. When I got back in, I
forgot to have 40th Army continue to encircle Cr/Rs, and pulled the
Cr/Rs activation next.

I'm starting to use artillery more, and close air support in offense.
Haven't tried it in defense yet.

This game could use some player aids very badly.

## Turn 7
