After rotating a number of games on and off the table without even
setting them up, I finally got a bug to do Scenario 2 in Duel on the
Steppe. I had a pretty good time playing [Scenario
1](/2014/06/07/duel-on-the-steppe.html), and I'd like to eventually play
Scenario 3, which is scenarios 1 and 2 played back to back. So it's a
good time to work through Scenario 2.

Also, I'm on PTO from work, so I have some time, even though I seem to
feel super tired at the moment.

## Setting up

The setup, as usual for simulation-type games, take a while. Need to
find the current units, then emplace the correctly on the map. It's
smart to lay out all the reinforcements as well.

Once it's set up, this scenario looks pretty grim for the Germans. Hard
to see how they are going to acheive many victory points, given that
they're already behind, and have to get far, far ahead.

## Highlights

These are some brief notes, don't have time or inclination to do a
blow-by-blow this evening.

### Turn 5

Looks very, very grim for the Germans, as nearly all of the
Russian units activated before any of the German units. Not that
motivated to write up many details this turn.

### Turn 6

The Germans got lucky twice this turn, by having most of their units
activated before the Russians got going. Almost turning into IGOUGO.

This was the first piece of luck.

The second piece of luck was some lady in a humoguous RV tried to turn
around in the cul-de-sac and crunched a neighbor's car. I raced out
there to move my car before it got crunched. When I got back in, I
forgot to have 40th Army continue to encircle Cr/Rs, and pulled the
Cr/Rs activation next, allowing an expitious escape for the Germans.

Nice reinforcements coming in for Cr/Rs, lucky it's still in business.

I'm starting to use artillery more, and close air support in offense.
Haven't tried it in defense yet.

This game could use some player aids very badly.

### Turn 7

First: Blunder, got through 7 of 12 activations forgetting about the
reinforcements!

### Turn 8


Final score: Russians 22, Germans 24.

Victory conditions prescribe a German win with 14 more VPs than
earned by the Russians, so this is a Russian win.

## AAR

Last night, I wanted to throw this game into the garbage because it felt
hopelessly unbalanced towards the Russians.

This morning (August 27), I feel much better, and even though the
Germans are going to lose it very badly, I can almost visualize how they
could win it. Almost. Enough to inspire me to take on the full campaign.

### Lessons learned

The key to killing units in this game is the ZOC elimination on retreat.
While other games enforce a step loss, or allow a retreat through a
"negated" ZOC, this game only allows negated ZOCs for tracing supply
lines. Hence, a low odds attack with a defender retreat can knock out a
*very* strong unit, as in GrossDeutschland strong. The Russians were
able to do this several times to the Germans, which makes sense due to
the sheer numbers of Russians. The Germans were unable to position
themselves to exploit ZOC elimination very often.

Another key thing for the Germans is to not get sucked up into fighting
when it's better to move into defensive terrain. Unfortunately, the
Russians win by doing nothing, so the Germans *must* find a way to fight
without losing too many units.

### Impression of the game

This game desperately needs a couple more player aids. I think I'll make
some up in advance before taking on the whole 8 turn scenario. In
particular:

1. OOB worksheet
1. Reinforcement schedule for each side, for the whole 8 turns, which
   can double as a dead pool as the game progresses.
1. Control markers for cities. Not strictly necessary, but I just like
that sort of thing.
1. More supply markers.
1. Air support staging worksheet. These sorts of things are often on the
map, and I believe there could have been room on this map.
1. Combat resolution worksheet which could be photocopied.

None of the above are strictly necessary, but they would make the game
easier to play.


### Blunders

1. Forgot to halve movement for Turn 6 mud.
1. Used air in Turn 6 when weather was rain.
1. Forgot to bring in reinforcements at the beginning of Turn 7.
