Time again for my once-a-month foray into the beastly Central America. I
really like the *concept* of this game, but I haven't quite picked up
the flow of it yet, and that's only using the ground forces. But let's
continue on.

The score so far is FDN 4, FSLN 0, by dint of the FDN occupying the Las
Vegas village which is worth 4 VPs.


## Turn 3

Picking up from [Bloody March Turn 2](/2014/07/27/bloody-march-turn-2.html),
it appears that the FDN is impregnable in their entrenchment at the town
of Las Vegas, so the FSLN needs to find better hunting elsewhere. For
example, picking on the out-of-supply Honduran unit CES.

### FSLN phases


* Supply: All FSLN units are in supply with the green-bordered hex 2012
containg the town of Ocotal.

* Regular Ground Unit Movement:

  * Veng: 2411 to 2212. Only 3 MP! Entering a forest hex costs 2 MP. So
take the road south.
  * Lopz: 2310 to 2208, road movement.
  * 50-02: 2310 to 1910, getting behind the HN unit using road movement.

* Insurgency Movement:

  * Uman, Pom: 2310 to 1908, HDN is now ZOC'ed, insurgency units exert a ZOC
    for combined defense value of 2 or more.
  * Mrh, Estr, PVP: 2411 to 2208.

  Insurgents ignore terrain costs for movement.

* First Insurgency Disbandment: None.

* Ground Combat:
Pom, Uman and 50-02 take on HN CES, which is out of supply in 1909. The
odds are 4:1, +1 DRM for attacking insurgency units. Allied force
decides to not use air defense as that would use up the helicopter
activation for this turn. At 4:1 +1 DRM, minimum attacker step loss plus
retreat. Since HN CES is EZOC'ed, that's two step losses for an
elimination, and a VP for the commies.

* Reserve Movement: None.

* Second Insurgency Disbandment: None.

* Reinforcement: No reinforcements.

The Communist phase went pretty fast this time. I'm getting the hang of
where to find the right rule when I need it.

### FDN phases

* Supply: All units in supply given the entrenchment provides supply at
Las Vegas. Otherwise, in supply from trail connection to La Rosita.

* Regular Ground Unit Movement: None, holding fast at Las Vegas.

* Insurgency Movement:

  * Sjac, Cond, Seg from 2509 to 2107 to reinforce the helicopter on the
  entrenched position at Silca.

* First Insurgency Disbandment: None.

* Air Mission: None, will use helicopter mission for ground combat
support. This was a mistake; had I used the helicopter for ground combat
defense of HN, it would have resulted in an attacker step loss (because
I recomputed the odds and rolled to see what would have happened). I
had intended on using the helicopter on the proceeding ground combat
phase, but there won't be one this turn for the FDN.

* Ground Combat: None, holding fast.


* Reserve Movement: All insurgents moved.


* Second Insurgency Disbandment: None.

* Helicopter Transport: None, HN got eliminated.

* Return to Base: Never left base.

* Reinforcement: No reinforcements.


Score: FSLN 1, FDN 4


This game isn't all that difficult, but there are a lot of different
capabilities to keep in mind. It's getting easier, and will get a lot
easier once I've pushed a lot more pieces around the board.

One interesting thing which I've noticed from the initial game up until
now in this game, is if there is any chance at all of getting a
unilateral attacker step loss during the communist combat phase, I've
been getting it. What are the odds? The only success I've had so far is
overwhelming odds where I don't have to roll the die. Seriously, while
there isn't much rolling, I seem to be consistently rolling 1s and 2s
every one all the communist attacks.

This turn took about an hour to play, including the writeup and all
associated rules lookups.

Here's what it looks like at the end of Turn 3. Veng is probably out of
play, it won't be able to get anywhere useful in 2 turns.

## After Action Report

This was a long adventure for such a short game.

### Some thoughts on the game

This first full play through has been quite a challenge. This is definitely
the most complex game I've played. In terms of absolute complexity, my
hunch is that it's near the top of a middle tier complexity, perhaps a
6, or the bottom of top tier of complexity, maybe 7, out of 9. Most of
the complexity is associated with the following:

* Long phase sequence on each turn, 16 phases for the standard game, 19
for the intervention game.

* Large variety of combat types, including ground to ground with armor
and infantry, air to ground, ground to air, close air support, air to
air, probably more with the intervention game and naval and marine
forces coming into play.

* Combat and movement factors are very small compared with other games.
  For example, with a movement factor of 3, in the forest, crossing a
  river hex requires the entire MF of 2 for forest hex entry plus one for
  crossing a river. Note that this applies to regular units. Insurgent
  units do not pay movement penalties.

  This has a side effect (or maybe a main effect) of making roads and
  trails extremely valuable to control.

* The insurgency rules add an unusual dimension to the game, almost like
having a second game running underneath the main game. The movement,
combat advantages and ephemeral nature of the insurgent forces requires
a fair bit of thought for effectively employing these forces.

While the above adds a fair bit of complexity, it turns out the that
record tracks manage what could have been a bookkeeping blowout. Other
than perhaps figuring odds, there is no need (so far) in the standard
game to break out the Mark I lead pencil. That in itself feels like
quite an acheivement to me.

The rule book is one of the best I've seen. While it's thick-ish (~60
pages for the standard game, 40 more for the intervention game), the
rules are remarkably clear. So much so that the few rules which are
vague or ambiguous really stand out. When the ambiguity is easily
noticed, it's much easier to infer intent, or at least provide a
reasonable house rule in lieue of a ruling.


### No dispersal

One of the odd things about the game is that it feels smaller scale than
it is. That is, it feels company sized, but it's not, it's brigade and
regiment sized. At a certain scale, step losses probably make more sense
than dispersals, especially with the reorganization mechanism for
rebuilding units.


### Closing observations

Some people are bothered that one of the basic premises of the game is
Sandinistas acting as Soviet proxies.

I can definitely understand why this is bothersome to many people, and
to some extent, I find it a small bit bothersome myself.

However, this conflict with all its associated Iran-Contra drama made
headlines for the better part of at least a couple of years. Its one of
only a couple of topics I recall listening to on NPR pretty much daily.
(Another being the savings and loan scandal. I was framing houses in
Austin at the time.)

It didn't seem to be clear to NPR what, exactly, was going on down
there.

So hindsight, as they say, is 20-20.

Fast forward to now, playing what was a state-of-the-art game when it
was published, I don't have any problem suspending disbelief.

In fact, if CA is "fantasy," it's no more or no less fantasy than
Victory Games popular Fleet series, which clearly (and thankfully!)
model hypothetical conflicts.
