Headed down to Endgame today to knock out a solo game of Situation 10.
Met Erich Schneider who was waiting for the historical board game group
to show up, but they never did, so I talked him into a game of
PanzerBlitz playing Situation #10.

I was German, Erich was Russian.

Pretty good game overall, and a pretty good scenario. We had to leave at
5 as Endgame was closing early for Labor Day, but Erich was definitely
ahead at the top of Turn 10, with 32 units on Board 3, against 16 kills
for me. That would be a decisive against a marginal for a tactical
Russian victory.

However, I'm pretty sure I could have destroyed 4 more Russian units to
turn it into a marginal Russian victory.

Highlights:

* Bad rolls for me kept me bottled up on the south side for an extra
turn at least.
* I did not move enough units north fast enough to deny the Russian's
real estate on Board 3. There is enough cover on board 3 to get a
Russian tactical victory, the Germans need to occupy some of that before
the Russians get established.

This was a good scenario. I want to play it again as the Germans.
