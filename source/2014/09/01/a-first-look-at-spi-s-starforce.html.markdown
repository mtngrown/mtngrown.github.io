This article will end up getting written over the course of several days
to a week, or more. It's Labor Day evening, and work kicks off tomorrow
morning, and I need to get the games out of my head for a few weeks.
Work will be busy, and some career stuff is coming up as well.

## Scenario 2

The initial move allows positioning at Epsilon Indi before the Solar
Hegemony arrives, which puts the SH at a combat disadvantage.

Victory conditions, either:

* Occupy Epsilon Indi (2325/-10)for 2 consecutive turns, or
* neutralize opposing stargate, where neutralizing opposing
  stargate trumps occupation of Epsilon Indi.

In the following, SH stands for Solar Hegemony, EEF stands for Epsilon
Eridani Forces.

Here's the initial set up showing the EEF's preliminary shift:

1](/images/starforce_scenario_1_initial.jpg)

The yellow forces (A, B and C) are Epsilon Eridani, the blue Solar
Hegemony (J, K, L and M).

### Turn 1

EEF shifts 2 star forces to occupy Epsilon Indi system.

SH shifts 2 star forces to position above Epsilon Indi.

### Turn 2

EEF holds fast, SH shifts zulu down to occupy Epsilon Indi as well.

Now it's time to battle it out. This is going to be interesting as
combat relies on imperfect imformation, bidding on atteck versus
defensive strength points, but I'll know both. Hopefully the scenario is
odds-balanced 50/50 on each side making perfect moves and combats. It
probably isn't, but it might well be close.


#### Turn 2 combat

Segment 1:

  * SH: 2/2, -1, roll d10: 1, result 0.
  * EEF: 3/3, +1, roll d10: 1, result 0.

Segment 2:

  * SH: 3/3, 0, roll d10: 2, result 0.
  * EEF: 3/3, 0 roll d10: 5, result 1.

  One SH starforce is eliminated.

Segment 3:

  * SH: 2/1, 0, roll d10: 2, result 0.
  * EEF: 4/2, 2, roll d10: 1, result 0.

Segment 4:

  * SH: 2/1, 0, roll d10: 9, result 1.
  * EEF: 4/2, +2, roll d10: 4, result 1.

  Both EEF and SH lose a starforce. Since one faction is completely
  eliminated, this battle, and turn, is over.

The EEF now has to expose their stargate to get 2 starforces onto
Epsilon Indi for a win. The SH needs to knock out the EEF stargate.

### Turn 3

EEF holds fast at Epsilon Indi to establish 2 turn occupation. The Solar
Hegemony makes a desperate gamble and shifts towards Epsilon Eridani. If
they can just neutralize the Epsilon Eridani stargate, they win.

### Turn 4

EEF is occupying Epsilon Indi with 2 starforces (B and C), SH has to shift L and M
to the EEF stargate and neutralize to win.

#### Turn 4 combat

Segment 1: Since a stargate cannot attack or be attacked in the first
combat segment, we move to segment 2 where the invading SH forces L and
M are allowed full combat effectiveness.

Segment 2:

  * EEF, 3/2, +1, roll d10: 8, result 2.
  * SH, 4/2, +2, roll d10: 2, result 0.

Result 2 eliminates both SH starforces for an EEF win.


## AAR

This is a very odd little game, and feels quite elegant. The odds are
such that one side or another should have an advantage, but it's not
clear to me which side it will be. It actually feels pretty well
balanced, given the amount of chance involved.

Another cool thing about the game is a "push your luck" mechanic with
both combat and shifting. This ensures both glorious victories and
horrible defeats. While at the same time, someone could play a very
conservative game close to the odds, and systematically chip away at his
or her opponent.

I will definitely be playing this again!
