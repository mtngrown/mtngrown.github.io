Turn 3 was so much easier (and more fun) than any of the previous turns
in this game or the first that it's not even 3 days and I'm motivated to
get through another turn. And maybe even finish up the Bloody March
scenario through Turn 5. We'll see.

## Turn 4

Continuing from [Bloody March Turn
3](/2014/08/29/bloody-march-turn-3.html), we find that the Honduran CES
has been sent packing, and the FDN forces are all huddled up in
entrenched positions, half at Las Vegas, the remaining with the CIA
helicopters at Silca.

The FSLN has decided this is *most* unsatisfactory, and will attempt to
dislodge the forces at Silca.

## After Action Report

This was a long adventure for such a short game.

### Some thoughts on the game

This first full play through has been quite a challenge. This is definitely
the most complex game I've played. In terms of absolute complexity, my
hunch is that it's near the top of a middle tier complexity, perhaps a
6, or the bottom of top tier of complexity, maybe 7, out of 9. Most of
the complexity is associated with the following:

* Long phase sequence on each turn, 16 phases for the standard game, 19
for the intervention game.

* Large variety of combat types, including ground to ground with armor
and infantry, air to ground, ground to air, close air support, air to
air, probably more with the intervention game and naval and marine
forces coming into play.

* Combat and movement factors are very small compared with other games.
  For example, with a movement factor of 3, in the forest, crossing a
  river hex requires the entire MF of 2 for forest hex entry plus one for
  crossing a river. Note that this applies to regular units. Insurgent
  units do not pay movement penalties.

  This has a side effect (or maybe a main effect) of making roads and
  trails extremely valuable to control.

* The insurgency rules add an unusual dimension to the game, almost like
having a second game running underneath the main game. The movement,
combat advantages and ephemeral nature of the insurgent forces requires
a fair bit of thought for effectively employing these forces.

While the above adds a fair bit of complexity, it turns out the that
record tracks manage what could have been a bookkeeping blowout. Other
than perhaps figuring odds, there is no need (so far) in the standard
game to break out the Mark I lead pencil. That in itself feels like
quite an acheivement to me.

The rule book is one of the best I've seen. While it's thick-ish (~60
pages for the standard game, 40 more for the intervention game), the
rules are remarkably clear. So much so that the few rules which are
vague or ambiguous really stand out. When the ambiguity is easily
noticed, it's much easier to infer intent, or at least provide a
reasonable house rule in lieue of a ruling.


### No dispersal

One of the odd things about the game is that it feels smaller scale than
it is. That is, it feels company sized, but it's not, it's brigade and
regiment sized. At a certain scale, step losses probably make more sense
than dispersals, especially with the reorganization mechanism for
rebuilding units.


### Closing observations

Some people are bothered that one of the basic premises of the game is
Sandinistas acting as Soviet proxies.

I can definitely understand why this is bothersome to many people, and
to some extent, I find it a small bit bothersome myself.

However, this conflict with all its associated Iran-Contra drama made
headlines for the better part of at least a couple of years. Its one of
only a couple of topics I recall listening to on NPR pretty much daily.
(Another being the savings and loan scandal. I was framing houses in
Austin at the time.)

It didn't seem to be clear to NPR what, exactly, was going on down
there.

So hindsight, as they say, is 20-20.

Fast forward to now, playing what was a state-of-the-art game when it
was published, I don't have any problem suspending disbelief.

In fact, if CA is "fantasy," it's no more or no less fantasy than
Victory Games popular Fleet series, which clearly (and thankfully!)
model hypothetical conflicts.
