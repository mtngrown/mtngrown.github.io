Alpha Centauri (AC) forces begin Turn 1 already in the LiteZulu (LZ),
and so choose to deploy dead center 100/0.

Solar Hegemony (SH) forces have to shift in on Turn 1, and choose to
enter the Tactical Display (TD) at hexes 540/0 and 541/0. (Note the
misprint "451" on the TD.)

## Turn 1

Turn 1 starts in the TD, and more or less defines the entire scenario:
whoever wins the tactical phase wins the game for Scenario 1.
