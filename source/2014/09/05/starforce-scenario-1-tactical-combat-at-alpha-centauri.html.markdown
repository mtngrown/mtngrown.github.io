Alpha Centauri (AC) forces begin Turn 1 already in the LiteZulu (LZ),
and so choose to deploy dead center 100/0.

Solar Hegemony (SH) forces have to shift in on Turn 1, and choose to
enter the Tactical Display (TD) at hexes 540/0 and 541/0. (Note the
misprint "451" on the TD.)

## Turn 1

Turn 1 starts in the TD, and more or less defines the entire scenario:
whoever wins the tactical phase wins the game for Scenario 1.

### Tac Turn 1

### Tac Turn 2

### Tac Turn 3

### Tac Turn 4



## AAR

The scenario description states that this is not to be considered
balanced, but I don't think it's that bad. Certainly, had the SH not
blundered into the stargate casting range quite so early, the outcome
could have been significantly different.

A case could be made that the single Alpha Centauri starforce is already
in battle mode, instead of having to change modes on Tac Turn 1. It may
not really matter, because it's allowed to position itself anywhere in
the Tac Display, and it won't know which boundary hexes the SH is going to
occupy. The entering forces will spend the entire tac turn changing
mode.
