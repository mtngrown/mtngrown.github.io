Played twice with AS today, PanzerBlitz and Battle for Moscow.

Situation #7 went on the table for PanzerBlitz. AS won this one, very
difficult for the Germans because of how victory conditions are defined.

I won Battle for Moscow outright, building a solid defensive cordon from
Kyuzam to Moscow. I believe I lost Tula, but no big deal. The game
otherwise went pretty well for me as the Russians.
