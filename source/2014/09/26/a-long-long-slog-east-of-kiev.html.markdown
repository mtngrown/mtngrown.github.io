I wrapped up a very long solo game of 10 turns of
[Situation #8 of
PanzerBlitz](/panzerblitz/games/situation-8-game-1.html)
a couple of days ago.

This was a very long game.

Despite all the effort I put into planning, the Germans were still
soundly whipped.

The link above has most of the gory and illustrated details. I took
enough pictures to be able to set up the scenario exactly the same for a
future play, at least for the Russians. I do plan on playing at least
one more solo game of Situation #8, possibly several, in an attempt
to get a better feel for just exactly how well the Germans can do.
