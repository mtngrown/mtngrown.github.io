The main goal for this game is digging into the mechanics of shifting,
especially Enhanced and Enhanced Gate shifting, both of which provide
increased range, but also require thinking ahead to carefully place
shift enhancing starforces. Tough to do in 3D on a flat piece of paper.

I'm reexamining combat as well, because I'm pretty sure I've been "Doing
It Wrong" somehow, to be expected from lack of experience.

The Basic Combat rules will be used for this game. A future game will
explore how the Advanced Combat rules play out.

## Scenario background

Scenario 3 follows Scenario 2 in the timeline, postulating the Solar
Hegemony collapsed and was replaced by the Pan-Human Hegemony. Humans
being what they are, friction with the Human League ensure hostilities
continued.

The PHH player has Sol and Alpha Centauri, and is using the blue
counters in the following screenshots. The Human League is using the tan
counters.

## Turn 1

The Pan-Human Hegemony (PHH) makes a Gate Shift from Alpha Centauri to
Epsilon Indi, it's a single shift, total no brainer to pick up a first
victory condition.

The Human League (HL)

Here's what it looks like at the end of Turn 1:

For some reason, it seems to be really difficult to get a good photo of
the StarForce map under plexi in any lighting conditions. I'll keep
trying.


## Turn 2

Hl and PHH are jockeying for position, getting starforces in range of
enemy gates to ensure overwhelming combat.

At the end of Turn 2:

Is the Human League really going after Sol? Or is that just a feint when
the real target is Alpha Centauri?

This scenario feels like it has a lot of replay value.


## Turn 3

Setting up for some combat. Note the PHH is positioned to accept an
Enhanced Shift from starforces A and B.

Combat looks likely next turn. Modulo breakoffs, Turn 4 might be the
last turn. Or, the invading starforces may all get wiped out and no
gates taken at all. We'll see.

## Turn 4

Looks like the Human League faked out the PHH after all, and will be
attempting to neutralize Alpha Centauri.

The PHH is definitely attempting Epsilon Eridani, they can't get
anywhere else within the next turn.

Here's what it looks like before combat gets under way:

Time for combat. As noted at the beginning, this is Basic Game rules.

### Combat at Alpha Centauri

That's 4 HL starforces against a starforce and stargate at Alpha
Centauri.

segment | faction | total | attack | defend  | net | roll | result
       -|-       -|-     -|-      -|-       -|-   -|-    -|-
      1 |  HL     |   8   |    5   |     3   | +3  |  6   |  2, 1 PHH lost
        |  PHH    |   3   |    1   |     1   | -2  |  1   |  NE
|-
      2 |  HL     |   12  |   10   |     2   | +6  |  6   |  5, gate lost
        |  PHH    |   5   |    1   |     4   | -1  |  1   |  1, 1 HL lost


### Combat at Epsilon Eridani

At Epsilon Eridani, we have a stargate and two starforces
resident with one shifting in for defenders (2x3 + 2 = 8 in Segment 1),
and 4 PHH starforces attacking.

This should be a roughly even match.

{:.center.fire-record}
segment | faction | total | attack | defend  | net | roll | result
       -|-       -|-     -|-      -|-       -|-   -|-    -|-
      1 |  HL     |   8   |    1   |     7   | -1  |  3   |  NE
        |  PHH    |   8   |    6   |     2   | -1  |  9   |  1 HL lost
|-
      2 |  HL     |   11  |    1   |    10   | -3  |  6   |  1 PHH lost
        |  PHH    |   12  |    8   |     4   | -2  |  6   |  1 HL lost
|-
      3 |  HL     |   8   |    1   |     7   | -2  |  6   |  1 PHH lost
        |  PHH    |  12   |    9   |     3   | +2  |  4   |  1 HL lost
|-
      4 |  HL     |   5   |   1    |     4   |  0  |  9   |  1 PHH lost
        |  PHH    |   6   |   5    |     1   | -1  |  3   |  NE
|-
      5 |  HL     |   5   |    3   |     2   | +1  |  6   |  1 PHH lost
        |  PHH    |   3   |    0   |     2   | -   |  1   |

That was nasty. It could have gone either way, but the PHH should also
have a slight statistical advantage. Trading losses 1 for 1 is a bad
deal for the attacker in this case, as the star gate just sits there
grinding down the attackers.

## AAR

Clear win for Human League, in part due to a large number of 6s rolled
when outnumbered at Epsilon Eridani, which chewed away at the PHH
starforces 1 at a time. That 9 for the HL was pretty helpful too.
It went 5 combat segments, and the last of 4 PHH
forces was in breakoff mode, but still was lost. It was just a bad day
for the Pan-Human Hegemony. Murphy must have brought his whole family.

The next time I play this either solo or as the PHH, I'm not going for
Epsilon Indi right away. I'll deal with that later, after reducing some
HL starforces and neutralizing an HL gate.

I really like this game. The mechanics are simple, but the decisions are
truly agonizing.

StarForce would be a *fantastic* game to umpire for people playing
double blind. I believe I'd want some sort of intelligence capability
though, such that at least some of the enemy OOB was exposed.
