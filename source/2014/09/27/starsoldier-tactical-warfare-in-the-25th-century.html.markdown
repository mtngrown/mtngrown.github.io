StarSoldier is "volume 2" of SPI's StarForce Trilogy. Over the next few
days, I'll be going through the rule book to learn the mechanics,
without getting into serious gameplay. That said, some sort of game will get
played.

The first thing I like to do when looking at a new game is throw some
counters on the board and push them around. The counters from Scenario 1
will do just fine.

First, which is what.

* Humans are the blue counters, and there should be 29 of them.
* L'Chal Dah are green counters, and there should be 25 of them.

Scenario 1 is a human-human engagement pitting the Solar Hegemony
against the Epsilon Eridane. The SH will be the Alpha Force,
the Epsilon Eridane the Bravo force. This scenario is specified to use
the Patrol Situation.

* Alpha: 1 squad
* Bravo: 1 fire team, 1 heavy weapons section

In the Patrol Situation, a base is defined to exist off the east or the
west edge of the map, whence the Bravo force sets up on the map and the
Alpha force enters the map on the opposite side of the base.

In this case, let's have the base off the west edge of the map, which
means the Solar Hegemony enters on the east edge. Given that
StarSoldiers is a simultaneous movement system, since the Bravo force is
already deployed, the first turn is the Alpha force moving on to the
map.

So far, so good. But this game could really use some decent player's
aids.

## Fire combat

The next obvious thing (for me) is figuring out how to blow stuff up.

## AAR


### Making a better game

Player aids:

* Record sheets similar to Starship Troopers would be much easier to
handle counters on a track.
