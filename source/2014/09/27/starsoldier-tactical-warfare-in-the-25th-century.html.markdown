StarSoldier is "Volume 2" of SPI's StarForce Trilogy. Over the next few
days, I'll be going through the rule book to learn the mechanics,
without getting into serious gameplay. That said, some sort of game will get
played.

The first thing I like to do when looking at a new game is throw some
counters on the board and push them around. The counters from Scenario 1
will do just fine.

First, which is what.

* Humans are the blue counters, and there should be 29 of them.
* L'Chal Dah are green counters, and there should be 25 of them.

Let's dig a little deeper into the mechanics.

## Fire combat

The next obvious thing (for me) is figuring out how to blow stuff up.
The best way I know how to do that is put a couple of soldiers on the
map and have them shoot at each other.

* Ss106 (SH)

| Operation | Target | TP
|     DF    | 2646   | 3
|     CM    |        | 2
|=

Attack strength = 3 x 2 = 6. Defense strength = 2RA + 2CM x 2 + 6
(terrain) = 12

* Ss203 (EE)

{:.center}
| Operation | Target | TP
|     DF    | 2040   | 3
|     CM    |        | 2
|=

Attack strength = 3TP x 2 = 6. Defense strength = 2RA + 2CM x 2 + 3
(organic cover)  = 9.

As it turns out, AS - DS <= 0 for both units, hence, no fire.

DF stands for Direct Fire, CM for Counter Measures which will add to the
effective defense strength, RA for Range Attenuation.

We're ready to play through Scenario 1.

## Scenario 1 The Epsilon Eridane Campaign

Scenario 1 is a human-human engagement pitting the Solar Hegemony
against the Epsilon Eridane. The SH will be the Alpha Force,
the Epsilon Eridane the Bravo force. This scenario is specified to use
the Patrol Situation.

* Solar Hegemony, Alpha: 1 squad
* Epsilon Eridane, Bravo: 1 fire team, 1 heavy weapons section

**Special Rules**

1. All urban areas treated as organic cover.
1. Epsilon Eridane is allowed Orbital Ground Support, maximum **per turn**:
  * 4 Orbital Bombardment Explosives,
  * 2 Orbital Laser Barrages,
  * 2 Orbital Opcaity Bombs.
1. No homing missiles for either side.

### More about the Patrol Situation


In the Patrol Situation, a base is defined to exist off the east or the
west edge of the map, whence the Bravo force sets up on the map and the
Alpha force enters the map on the opposite side of the base.

In this case, because my game table is roughly 2' by 3', and I have no
convenient place for record tracks, the Alpha Force (SH) will enter the
north edge of the map, with the base off map to the south. The record
tracks go under plexiglas on the western half of the map, leaving the
eastern half for game play.

**Patrol-specific Rules**

Although StarSoldiers uses a simultaneous movement system, since the
Bravo Force (EE) is already deployed, the first turn is the Alpha force
moving on to the map. In the Patrol Situation, *Alpha can only task
movement (MV) and countermeasures (CM) on entry*.

Alpha may enter the map in any mode.

**Patrol victory conditions**

* Alpha:
  * 2 points for every Task Point loss in PL of Bravo force;
  * 10 point for every starsoldier exited from map

* Bravo:
  * 3 points for every Task Point loss on Alpha's Preservation Level.

**House Rule** because the map is "short," the Alpha Force enters with
depleted Task Points.


### Setting up

There is a *lot* of record keeping in StarSoldier, and it doesn't look
like the fun kind. I don't necessarily have much of a problem with that,
but it makes it hard to find opponents.

The first task is assigning "serial numbers" to each starsoldier such
that their Task Points can be tracked.

## Turn 1

## AAR

So far, so good. But this game could really use some decent player's
aids.

### Making a better game

Player aids:

* Record sheets similar to Starship Troopers would be much easier to
handle counters on a track.
