Played first in-person game of Fire in the Lake today with 3 others. I
played the NVA and lost, but in the end, didn't lose by as much as I
thought I was going to.

What I learned from playing NVA is that the Rally and Infiltration
operation and special activity combination is key to NVA victory. So
much depends on having the NVA fully deployed, and infiltration is the
only way the NVA get on the map.

Definitely want to play this again, many times, and definitely want to
continue playing the NVA to get a better grip on both strategy and
mechanics.

Fire in the Lake has loads of replay value.
