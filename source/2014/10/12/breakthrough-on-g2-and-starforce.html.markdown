We had a big day today at Endgame.

At least 3 maybe 4 games of Breakthrough were played,
and a giant game of Recon in Force, which featured
"Knowlton's Knights" (infantry mounted on GEV-PC)
charging into the fray to wreak havoc and destruction.

Much stuff was blown up.

There's more: Al was introduced to StarForce, a vintage
classic space combat game featuring simultaneous
movement on a 3D map, and (wait for it...) blowing stuff up.
Al was pretty sure he didn't like StarForce, but he did
insist on playing it 3 times in a row. Works for me.

Andrew brought missile tank cookies. Shortbread.
Delicious.

And that's Ogre for now.

However...

Some of us are starting to meet up with the East
Bay Wargaming Yahoo group folks who play at
Endgame on 1st and 3rd (and 5th) Sundays. While
it isn't (necessarily) Ogre, there is still the blowing
up of stuff. They're on the calendar at Endgame.
Consider stopping by in the meantime, between
Ogre sessions.


Until next time,
