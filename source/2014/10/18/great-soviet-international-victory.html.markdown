8. Bukharin fights! Crazy that this is the first card.

<br>

20.

<br>

27. German Capitulation! Dawn cards already. This is crazy, all the
    cards are in play by Turn 4. This might be an interesting game.

<br>

57. Removed Southern Front from play. Awesome.

<br>

3. Need to drive baltic back from Petrograd, took 3 rolls to go back 2
box. This could have been game ending.

<br>

11. Baltic back to 3.

<br>

23. Attack Eastern, no effect.

<br>

4. No effects.

<br>

32. Baltic is killing me this game

<br>

5. Good rolls, pushed back some fronts.

<br>

42. Baltic back 2, regained political dissent loss.

<br>

52.

<br>

29. +2 drm against baltic, yes please.

<br>

1. Allies back to Archangel.

<br>

56. Drive on Eastern Front succeeds, back to Omsk.

<br>

33. Whiffed

<br>

24. Whiffed

<br>

26. +1 for Reorganization, roll 5, 5, Communist Subversion, Actions before
    Events. I don't know how to play this yet, but I suspect it's quite
    powerful if used correctly.  This is cool because it won't expire,
    we're already in Dawn Epoch.

    Poland and Eastern driven back.

<br>

50. Allies advance, then driven back to Archangel.

<br>

21. Czar's Fate! And Eastern is in Ekaterinburg! Oh noes! But. But
but but, the communists are subverting, hence, I can play the
actions before the events. I'll play a Reserve Offensive first
to frive Eastern to Omsk, then get +1 drm on all other
offensives. I do need to watch my political track though. Allies
back to Archangel, whiffed a political roll.

<br>

13. Eastern and Poland back.

<br>

51. Bad luck! Curzon line activated. Whiffed two political
rolls. Maybe one political roll succeeded in this game so
far. Mote than half through the cards though.

<br>

44. Drive Eastern off the board: subversion scores again.
Roll 6 to get to Omsk, play reserve to Irkutsk. Also,
drive Baltic back from Petrograd, that would be bad if
it advanced into Moscow.

<br>

49. Polish advance on Lvov, political point list.
Bummer. Allies driven back from Vologda to Lake
Onega.

<br>

25. Baltic advance into Moscow from
    Petrograd...except subversion. Roll 6, it moves
    back to Pskov, then advance back to Petrograd.
    As long as I have reserves, I can work with
    this. And Finland is removed.

<br>

59. Poland is off the map with roll 5! Now to
focus on Allies and controlling Baltic.

<br>

7. Push Allies back to Archangel.

<br>

12. Baltic back to Pskov.

<br>

40. No op, Southern is off the map.

<br>

43. Time to get Allies off map. Roll 6, spend
reserve offensive and the Allies are sent packing.
Political roll 2. Cripes.

<br>

46. Petrograd fortified, take that Baltic.

<br>

60. Baltic is contained, 4 actions available on
this turn. Roll politics: 2, 1, 2, 3. Dang.

<br>

35. All active fronts advance, which means
Baltic, except that it rolled 5, so too bad,
stay in Pskov you losers.

<br>

54. Political roll succeeds, now at 3 with
both reserves available.

<br>

6. Baltic advance, but no offensives
 allowed. Too bad their still stuck
 inPskov. Losers. Political now at 4.

<br>

15. Baltic back to Estonia.

<br>

47. Another Baltic advance, but +1 drm
with 2 actions; back to Estonia.

<br>

17. A nasty card, but +1 on Reorg roll.
Let's try it: nada.

<br>

14. 4 actions! Baltic back to Estonia,
Political back to 4.

<br>

30. Political roll fest: 1, boo. Action:
   Baltic back to Riga. If I get through
   thenext couple of cards, should be a
   military win.

<br>

41. Political dissent roll: add one
for Political at 5.

<br>

53. Political: whiffed.

<br>

22. Lose 1 political, boohoo, advance
1 political on roll.

<br>

55. Political at 6, now 7.

<br>

2. Political at 8.

<br>

34. +1 drm for reorg, yes! Another
Communist Subversion, whatever.

<br>

16. Last card, military victory,
first time for me.

Score:

* 5 fronts removed times 6 points
each: 30.
* Political: 8.
* Available resources, 4 times 2: 8.
* Baltic in Riga: 4.

Total: 50.

International Victory!
