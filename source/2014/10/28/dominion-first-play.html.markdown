First play of Dominion, with Pat L and friends.

This is also my first play of any sort of deck building game.

I lost pretty big, probably came in last, but that's ok. Playing to win
on a first play when the rest of the table has much more experience
seems like a recipe for analysis paralysis, and that's no fun for
anyone.

In any case, it's a fun game. I can see the attraction. I probably won't
purchase it for myself, but as with Settlers of Catan, would be happy to
play with anyone pretty much anytime wargames aren't coming out.
