Work is really heavy on my mind at the moment. I don't have the mental
energy to set up something heavier like a wargame. Even light wargames
are far heavier than most other games.

Today I decided to break out Flash Point, one of the first (if not the
first) "real" game I purchase a couple of years ago. I wanted to get
Pandemic as I had just played it at the time, but the game store didn't
have it in stock. They recommended Flash Point.

I took it home, but did no more than rip the shrink off. Didn't even
punch the pieces. Hence, a perfect game for today. While I'd prefer to
play this with other people, I do like learning the rules on my own in
advance. Just seems to work out better that way.

Per the rules recommendation, I set up the "Family Game" to teach
myself. This is a simpler stripped down scenario. I decided not to take
copious notes on this game, instead, just focus on the game play and
understanding how the rules work. To keep it simple, I chose to use 1
firefighter, the red one of course.

## A surprise win for Game 1

Given that I wasn't "playing for a win" it's a bit surprising that a
single firefighter was able to win it. The results:

* 14 damage markers placed,
* 25 fires on the board,
* 7 rescued,
* 1 lost on a flashover, which turned out to be a false alarm victim.


Here's what it looked like at the end of the game:

I'd say I got pretty lucky on this game. The fire advances and POI
placements all turned out to be pretty convenient for my firefighter
running around.  The dice could have just as easily knocked me off the
board 2 or 3 times.  It feels like the board was 2 or 3 turns away from
going totally nuts.

The new iPhone 6+ takes much better pictures than the old 3G I used to
have.

## Upshot

Flash Point "Family Game" plays fast and easy. I can see the appeal. The
basic mechanics admit a lot of chrome, that's evident from even a single
play. I'll definitely be playing this again, and hopefully with some
others for coop play.
