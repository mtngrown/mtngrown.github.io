Played another beginner setup of Flash Point this evening. Here's how it
went:

* Played with two firefighters instead of 1.
* Figured out carrying a victim costs 2 AP instead of 1 AP. This slows
it down a lot!
* Not so lucky rolls this time. One of the firefighters was Knocked
Down, although it was lucky he was right by a door next to the Ambulance
area, so no big deal.
* Rescued 5 victims, lost two, one of which was a False Alarm.
* A couple of unlucky Explosions ate up damage markers, so I lost by
Building Collapse.

This game, even though I lost, felt a bit more satisfying than the
previous, which I probably won because of not paying two AP for carrying
victims.

I'll probably play more of these kinds of games in the evenings. There
is a good cost benefit ratio here, better than reading expensive books.
I'd prefer to wargame in general, but that's proven a bit too heavy for
evening entertainment to date. We'll see what happens in the future.
