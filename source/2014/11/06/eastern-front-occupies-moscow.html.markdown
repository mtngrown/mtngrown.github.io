Another play of Soviet Dawn. I'm starting to get the hang of the rules
now, and develop some strategy for how to play the events.

Twilight Round:

* Cards: 5, 4, 2, 8.
* Fronts:
  * Eastern: 4
  * Southern: 3
  * Baltic: 2

  All other fronts inactive.

* Reorganization: Comintern.
* Germany and Mannerheim in play.

Went for the Treaty.

Darkness Round:

* Cards: 30, 17, 20, 46, 16, 34, 7, 6, 25, 11, 21, 52, 24, 13
* Fronts:
  * Eastern: Moscow
  * Southern: 2
  * Allies: 3
  * Poland: 4
  * Finland off

The Czar liberated card really hurt. It changed the game from taking
action to salvaging the best defeat possible, which didn't turn out that
great!

Score: Military Strategic Defeat, 30 cards remaining.
