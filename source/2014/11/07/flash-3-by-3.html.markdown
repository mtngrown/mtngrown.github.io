Three firefighters now. Strangely, it's getting harder to beat. But
perhaps my initial play was beginner's luck. All the victims were fairly
close by each other, the fire didn't spread, and of course I was
spending only 1 AP to carry, which is wrong. But still, there was some
good luck involved.

Consider this game: four of the first six victims were False Alarms,
with the real victims getting blown out in explosions. That's just bad
luck.

I used some APs to put out fires in this game as well, first time for
that.

Now I'm curious if I can win it again. But not tonight.
