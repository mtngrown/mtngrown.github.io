Al S and I are going to play through the Snoopy's Nose scenario in the
Vietnam Battles issue of Modern War. This game uses the "Fire and
Movement" system common to several other games in the Decision Games
portfolio.

## Setting it up

The VC moves:

In this case, an obvious VC target would be 3 of the 5th Cav.

## Turn 2



## Turn 3

## Turn 4

US nearly surrounds 514/1.

Bombard to use up counterbattery, has no other effect. US fields 5 + 5
bombardment, 514/1 counters with 5 + 2. This removes the +5
counterbattery from the VC arsenal for this turn, providing 1 less delta
for defensive fire support.

Here's the situation with bombardment counters shown, and the VC in
position after Turn 3:

Combat:

US attacks with:

* Monitor: 1
* 3/47 A: 2
* 3/47 B: 2
* 3/47 C: 2
* 4/47 B: 3
* 4/47 C: 3
* FS: 12
* Total: 25

VC defends with:

* 514/1: 5
* FS: 10
* Total: 14

Delta: +11 for US.

The odds are 50% retreat with D2 or D3 which would be a US win, or an
Ex(change), which would result in a draw.
