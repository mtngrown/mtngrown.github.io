Played a quick game of Objective Kiev with Al S.

As seems to be usual, the German side lost. I happened to be on the
German side for this match.

Not sure what we're doing wrong. Ostensibly, the game (and Objective
Moscow) is balanced, but we're sure not seeing it. We're having a hard
time even getting to a draw with either game.

Clearly, more plays are in order.
