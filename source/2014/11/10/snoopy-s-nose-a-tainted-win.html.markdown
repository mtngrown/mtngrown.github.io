Played the 13 turn Snoopy's Nose scenario with AS today. Was a very
fun game, and came down to the last turn, superior firepower carried
the day.

## Turns 5-13

At this point, we got very involved in the game and didn't feel like
taking the time to record the play turn by turn.

## Blunders

I'm pretty sure I moved the mech units too fast across rivers on the
last two turns. I think it costs them all MP to get across without
having engineer close by for building bridge. I was charging an extra MP
similar to the leg units.

If this is the case, our game was very, very close.  Restricting mech
movement more would have made the final two turns way closer on the
rolls.  Pretty sure I played the mech more or less correctly up until
then though, as the mech stayed mainly on roads and in clear.

On the other hand, we forgot about the fire support penalty against VC
losing bases: each base costs an extra fire support marker.

## Development opportunity

* Letter-sized full color laminated map for both players. The VC can
mark their units, the US can mark the areas which have been swept.
