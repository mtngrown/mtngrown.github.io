Playing Germans against CC Allies.

I established a pretty good line early on, then took a bit of a risk by
briefly taking Le Ket. Unfortunately, this thinned out my line a liitle
too much and Allies took a couple of my units off the board. A fast
regroup wasn't enough to firm up the line, had to start retreating by
Nov 30.

Dec. 2 Germans could be in a lot of trouble really soon. The line
forward of Bizerta needs to be pulled back.

Dec. 6, Germans breaking out to retake lost ground. Operationally, some
of the Allied units are enveloped to the east.

Dec. 8, some break out by the Germans to recapture lost ground, but
conceded as a decisive Allied Victory. The Germans just gave up too much
ground early on attempt to maintain a defense of Tunis.
