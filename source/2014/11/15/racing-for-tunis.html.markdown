Playing Germans against CC Allies.

I established a pretty good line early on, then took a bit of a risk by
briefly taking Le Ket. Unfortunately, this thinned out my line a liitle
too much and Allies took a couple of my units off the board. A fast
regroup wasn't enough to firm up the line, had to start retreating by
Nov 30.

Dec. 2 Germans could be in a lot of trouble really soon. The line
forward of Bizerta needs to be pulled back.

Dec. 6, Germans breaking out to retake lost ground. Operationally, some
of the Allied units are enveloped to the east.

Dec. 8, some break out by the Germans to recapture lost ground, but
conceded as a decisive Allied Victory. The Germans just gave up too much
ground early on attempt to maintain a defense of Tunis, and the Aliies had
to catch a train back to Berkeley.

Here's what it looks like set up:

A few units may be a hex out of place as I had bumped the table
attempting the first picture. But the overall deployment shows the
general idea: the Germans in a defensive line around Tunis and Bizerta
to control the ports and airfields.

## Turn length and timing

The standard game has 18 turns. Given 10 minutes per side, that's a game
length of 6 hours.  However, as noted above, the game ended at roughly
15 turns as some of our middle turns went longer than shorter.

We went closer to 7.5 hours, having started around 3 pm, ending around
11:30, with an hour off for dinner.  It felt like a lot longer. Two
immediate reasons for this are 1. 11:30 pm is later than I usually like
to stay up, and 7.5 hours is longer than I usually play. Writing this
the following morning, I recall having to suck it up during the last few
turns.

## How to win as Germans

In short, I don't know. I'm pretty sure the Germans have to be played a
lot more agressively than I was playing them though. We didn't play with
the optional supply rules, and I think that would have made a difference
in both side's play. Certainly the Germans would have attempted to cut
off extreme eastern Allied advancement.
