Another solitaire game, this time using the standard set up with 4
firefighters. Here's the result:

* 3 victims rescued, 1 false alarms, 1 victim lost.
* Defeat, collapse.

I find it difficult to remember which firefighter turn, and sometimes
whether a fire has advanced for that turn. I suspect in this game I had
two extra fire advances.

In future games, I think I should create a checklist for recording turns
so that I don't skip a firefighters, and don't advance the fire to
quickly.

## Game 2

Bored, sick, knocked out another game and listed it. Here's how it went
down:

* 4 firefighters
* 4 victims rescued, 2 lost, 5(!) false alarms.

I think I'm missing something. Will have to read the rules carefully
again.
