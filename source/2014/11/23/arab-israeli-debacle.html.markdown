Met up with SK at Endgame to start a sequence of plays through
Arab-Israeli Wars.

I learned a very important lesson: I suck!

Steve just dismantled as the Israelis in the first game (Situation B-1)
and again as the Egyptians in the second game (Situation S-2).

## Situation B-1

We agreed to play an 8 turn variant where Egyptians got more points for
Israeli kills. Was only able to keep 2 Israeli units on the board, and
some bad die rolling didn't even get me any dispersions much less
kills. Unlucky in this one.

## Situation S-2
