Met up with SK at Endgame to start a sequence of plays through
Arab-Israeli Wars.

I learned a very important lesson: I suck!

SK just dismantled as the Israelis in the first game (Situation B-1)
and again as the Egyptians in the second game (Situation S-2).

## Situation B-1

We agreed to play an 8 turn variant where Egyptians got more points for
Israeli kills. Was only able to keep 2 Israeli units on the board, and
some bad die rolling didn't even get me any dispersions much less
kills. Unlucky in this one. Also, we played Basic rules which don't have
overrun. That probably would have made a difference as the T-34s are
speedier than the Israeli armor.

## Situation S-2

We switched sides for S-2, myself taking the Israeli, SK taking the
Egyptian. This is actually a very cool scenario. We played standard
rules, and I learned a lot:

* Artillery has to be registered in advance for indirect fire.
* Overrun doesn't work like it does in PanzerBlitz. It's more like
  an "armored close assault with advance after combat."
* Infantry can fire on armor!  Oh noes!
* Opportunity fire is really important.

Also, I learned that when there is no terrain to help establish a
defensive line, do not attempt to establish a defensive line. If strong
in fire and range, shoot from long distance. If fast but weak, close and
assault.
