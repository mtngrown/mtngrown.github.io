CC brought over an interesting little game called Pirateer, which we
played before the "Race for Tunis" main event. As the title indicates,
it's a lot like dice with checkers, with pirates. Rules take about 5
minutes to process. It's a four player game, so we each took two
factions.

Apparently, there is some controversy surrounding the game and the
designer, none of which is relevant here, but does serve a bit of human
interest along with the game.

Evidently, there are variant and "advanced" rules beyond what we played.
Would be interesting to check some of those out.

Great little warmup (or warm down) game. Will play it again.
