Another play of Race for Tunis with CC. We switched side from the last
game: I played Allied forces here and CC the Axis.

We decided to play the standard scenario with all the optional rules.

Here is the game recapped turn by turn.

## Nov. 25, 1942

Weather: clear.

* Axis: destroys bridge south of Bizerta, moves forces out of Bizerta
  and Tunis, aggressively establishing an offensive line push south and
  west.
* Allies: Shoring up line as best as possible to prevent large Axis push
  to the west.

## Nov. 26, 1942

Weather: clear.

* Axis: Pushing hard to the southwest; eliminated French unit.
* Allies: Holding.

## Nov. 27, 1942

Weather: clear.

* Axis: big reinforcement arrival, destroy bridge east of Mateur.
  Continuing to put pressure southeast.
* Allies: Still holding, looks like will need to start yeilding ground
  soon.

## Nov. 28, 1942

Weather: clear.

* Axis: Still moving south, targeting French for elimination.
* Allies: Working hard to hold the line, French are getting sacrificed,
  which is bad, as they cannot come in as replacements.

## Nov. 29, 1942

Weather: Rain.

* Axis: Pushing hard to the west, targeting weak French units.
* Allies: Paras drop east of Tunis to attempt to capture Tunis, but
  unable to move into city. Holding elsewhere. Air on dirt strips
  grounded.

## Nov. 30, 1942

Weather: Clear.

* Axis: Some inclusive jockeying about; retreated the Allied paras.
* Allies: Falling back slowly to the west, trying to bait the Axis into

## Dec. 1, 1942

Weather: Rain.

* Axis: Chasing the para and commando units, holding elsewhere. Really
  bad luck see 2 Para destroying an attacking force.
* Allies: Reinforcements coming in north and south, driving east at high speed.
  overextending in an attempt to cut supply.

## Dec. 2, 1942

Weather: clear

* Axis: Feeling some pressure, what with Allied special forces units
  running around in the hinterland. They may be out of supply, but they're
  still dangerous.
* Allies: Paras drop onto Djebaba, lost commando unit at El Anuiona. No
  big deal, will bring this back in as a replacement.

## Dec. 3, 1942

Weather: Rain.

* Axis: Crappy reinforcement. Destroyed more bridges, attempted to
  recapture airfield at Djebaba.
* Allies: Chewing away at Axis engineer units.

## Dec. 4, 1942

Weather: clear.

* Axis: Stalling for time now, trying to hold a line almost a little
  west of due south from Bizerta. Eliminated a powerfull allied mech
  unit with application of a lot of air power.
* Allied: Yeilding the line, buying time for reinforcements to come in
  and shore it up.

## Dec. 5, 1942

Weather: Clear.

* Axis:
