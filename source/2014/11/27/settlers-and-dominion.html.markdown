Was at PL's in Alameda for Thanksgiving. We ended up playing an
absolutely nutty game of Catan with 6 people. There was loads of
trading and even giving cards away. I might have won it had I been just
a little more familiar with some of the more esoteric rules.

Followed up with Dominion, where I lost (again) very, very badly. I'm
not very good at Dominion.
