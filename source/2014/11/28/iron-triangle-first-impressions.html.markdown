"Iron Triangle" is the second game in Decision Games "Vietname Battles"
issue of *Modern War.*  The other being [Snoopy's
Nose](/2014/11/10/snoopy-s-nose-a-tainted-win.html). These are fairly
short games with around a dozen turns on 17 by 22 maps.

This game simulates Operation Cedar Falls, a massive effort by the US
and ARVN to locate and remove VC from tunnel complexes near Cu Chi,
roughly 45 miles north-northwest of Saigon.

Goal for this game is to get some familiarity with it before playing
FtF.  The main interest in this game is how the tunnel complexes are
handled, as they negate ZOC.

VC chose the "run" victory condition.

## Turn 1

Here's the situation at the end of Turn 1:

It's already apparent the the tunnels are going to be where the action
is. the jungles on the north edge are slow movement for both, there is
time to intercept.

## Turn 2

US forces swing around to intercept VC moving west. Looks like a lot of
VC going to exit this turn.

4 VC off the board, rolled a 1, game over VC victory.

hmph.
