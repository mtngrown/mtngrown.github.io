I'm setting up Scenario 1, the "Race for Tunis" in the OCS *Tunisia*
game. There is a lot of vocabulary I to learn, some of which seems to be
assumed known to the player. For example, the setup OOB calls for
"charcoal trucks," which I've never heard of. Cursory examination of
relevant forums didn't turn up much information. So I had to go to
Google, where I found the following links.

has a very interesting human interest article by Corporal Robert
Hopkins, who turns out to be [Harry
Hopkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hopkins) son.

So that's pretty cool.

We're not going to ever run out fuel, not really. We might get low for a
few decades before finding a sustainable steady state, but the fuel is
there. It grows by itself, for free.

## Setting up Tunisia

Setting up an OCS game which models an actual, historical battle is a
non-trivial exercise. Tunisia has the advantage of of having few units
on the map at the beginning of the game. However, this is offset by
having often substantial reinforcements arriving nearly every single
turn. For game play reasons, these reinforcements should be organized in
advance.
