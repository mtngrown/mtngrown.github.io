Back to Vietnam with a *very* early (1973) game entitled "Battle for
Hue," designed by John Hill of later Squad Leader fame.

Battle for Hue is not a "pretty" game, not at all. The map and counters
are workaday servicable, there is no eye candy here. That said, the type
on the 1/2" counters is large and easy to read, even in lower light.

More features of the game:

* Rules are one sheet of folded tabloid.
* CRT is bloody: there is no defense, simply firepower.
* The counters have firepower and range values, there is no defense
  factor on any counter. There is no dispersion, step loss or
  disorganization. A unit either survives an attack or it does not.
* Fire is "simultaneous." Units being fired on can (usually) return
  fire. No units are removed until they can return fire.

Lacking any idea of what I need to do, here's my initial set up for a
solo game:
