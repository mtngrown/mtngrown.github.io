Back to Vietnam with a *very* early (1973) game entitled "Battle for
Hue," designed by John Hill of later Squad Leader fame.

Battle for Hue is not a "pretty" game, not at all. The map and counters
are workaday servicable, there is no eye candy here. That said, the type
on the 1/2" counters is large and easy to read, even in lower light.

More features of the game:

* Rules are one sheet of folded tabloid.
* There are no hex numbers on the map.
* CRT is bloody: there is no defense, simply firepower.
* The counters have firepower and range values, there is no defense
  factor on any counter. There is no dispersion, step loss or
  disorganization. A unit either survives an attack or it does not.
* Fire is "simultaneous." Units being fired on can (usually) return
  fire. No units are removed until they can return fire.
* The game could run more than 36 turns, as the game ending condition is
  "no more NVA/VC in the inner city." I may not play *this* game quite
  that long.

Lacking any idea of what I need to do, here's my initial set up for a
solo game:

In the north, NVA focus is on capturing the armory as fast as possible to
get counter upgrades, including extra VC rolls. In the south, NVA will
attempt to roadblock and ZOC US entry from Phu Bai. Note that all the
NVA in the inner city start in built up areas, and have no stacking
capability.

Let's see what happens.

## January 31, 1968: opening moves

**NVA Move** NVA moves up to ARVN armory, ARVN "first fire" fails with a d6 roll 6.
Rolling a 6 in this game is pretty much bad news at any odds, what with
the DRMs.

**First Fire Phase** NVA targets the ARVN armory. The choice is whether
to play it safe and wear down the bunkered and barbed wire defense (+4
DRM) over a couple of turns, or take the riskier option of trying to eliminate
more units with lesser firepower per unit. Since the NVA can use rockets
this turn, the safer alternative looks better: take out the higher
firepower ARVN defenders first. First roll is a 4 at 12+, defender
eliminated. Second roll is a 2, also defender eliminated. Follow on
attacks by W 3-6 units eliminate on a roll of 1: roll, 1, 3! Bunker
next to ARVN armory is clear, 1 unit in armory remains.

ARVN fires: roll 3 defender in clear, eliminated, roll 6 miss.

** ARVN/US Road Movement** Police units move to flank NVA infantry unit.

** ARVN/US Non-road Movement** close with NVA, first fire: NVA rolls 5
on firepower 2, miss.

** Second Fire Phase**: ARVN rolls 5, miss, NVA rolls 2, miss with +2
DRM in city hex.

And that's it for Turn 1, January 31, 1968.

## February 1, 1968: VC eruption

The VC enter the game this turn, determined by rolling 2 d6: 9!
What a great roll for the commies. The few reviews for this game
emphasize the hopelessness of the NVA/VC situation, but it's looking
about as good as it could at the moment.


## AAR


### Blunders

Clearly, the initial ARVN blunder was not packing in all available ARVN units
around the armory and 1st Div. HQ.
