Finally finished up Situation #8, which has been hogging up my desk
space since around Thanksgiving.

* [Solitaire notes](/panzerblitz/solitaire.html)

This was not a satisfying experience for the following reasons:

1. The Germans misused heavy artillery by bringing Wespe and Hummel up
   to the line to get direct fire on Russian infantry, instead of
   stationing these fragile units in the hinterland. However, it worked,
   especially with...
2. ...too many lucky rolls on the first couple of turns. The Germans
   eliminated 4 Russian infantry units within the first few turns, and
   that made a difference.
3. Having to sneak along the edge hexes of the map as every other hex on
   the board was withing firing reach of Russian artillery and mortars.

I go into more detail in the writeup linked above.
