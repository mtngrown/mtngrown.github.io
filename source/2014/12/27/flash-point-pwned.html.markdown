Played a couple of rounds of Flash Point with BB and QA
at YT in Oakland. We played the beginner game twice. The
first round was with the suggested setup, the second we rolled in 3
explosions randomly, with 12 fires on the board at start.
Game 1 we barely won, having had a lot of explosions and coming close to
collapse. Game 2 we totally owned, despite having more fires on the map.

It was good to play this with others, as BB read the rules slightly
differently than I did, and I learned I have been playing it wrong with
respect to putting out fires. I need to get in another solo game to lock
those rules in.
