Met up with AS at EGO to play the short scenario of Fire in the Lake.
We had both played it once before as a four player game with two other
players who were expert. I took the NVA and the VC, AS took the ARVN
and US.

Basically, we didn't have any idea what we were doing, so we just ran the cards
out and did the best we could. I mostly focused on NVA rally and march,
and denying the event cards to US. The VC really didn't do a lot of anything,
except at the last coup round where I was able to flip a lot of support
towards opposition.

Either VC (by ratio) or NVA (by count) won, but only by a very small amount.

This game is worthy of mastery.
