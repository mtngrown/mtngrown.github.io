[Battle for Hue](/2015/12/25/battling-for-hue.html) has been taking up
all of my free time last few weeks (along with some medical stuff and
keeping up at work), so I thought I'd put a fast, easy game on the table
for a change. As it turns out, this was about as fast and easy as it gets.

**Card 15** Advance Southern: Roll political all three, advance 2 on political track.

**Card 21: Advance Southern: all 3 rolls againts southern fail.

** Card6** Advance Southern: all rolls fail.

**Card 7** Southern enters Moscow, game over, Crushing Defeat.

I should have played a Reserve Offensive, but didn't think about
while I was marveling at my horribly bad rolling. Besides, I like
to reverse the reserves for later in the game when there is more
at stake, like potentially a victory.

My goal was a political win for this game. Instead, I got handed about
as fast a defeat as possible in the game.
