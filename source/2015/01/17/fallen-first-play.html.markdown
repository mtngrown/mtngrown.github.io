For some reason, I've lately had problems with attention span.
I set up a game, play enough of it to learn the rules, then I'm
bored or stressed and don't feel like continuing.

I believe this may be in part due to current project at work,
which is taking much longer than it should (in my opinion).
The scope of the work seems to increase the longer I work on it,
so every time I think I have a handle on it, I end up finding
another week's worth of effort is necessary. Along with that,
stuff in my personal life is becoming very stressful. Without
going into details, it's stuff that needs to get handled now
or will be lost permanently. Add taxes and the usual end of year,
start of year responsibilities, it adds up to a lot of distraction
exactly when I need to be able to *really* decompress.

Anyway, the Fallen Kickstarter finally shipped, and I have the game
set up for the first time. So far, I'm really impressed. The
production values are outstanding, and half way through the first
"stroy card," the game play is pretty good as well.

There is a lot going on in this games, and a lot of ways for both
sides to come from behind.

## Two stories in

At the end of the second story, the game is nominally half over.
There are three stories and one "final battle," obviously, not
sure how long the final battle will take to play out.

So far, the DL is ahead, and the Hero is in the hurt locker. I
don't see how to turn it around, but there's enough dice rolling
to make it possible. I'm not playing the DL all that smart anyway.

## Final Challenge

The DL won the game, in part due to some super crappy rolls from
the Hero.

But it was pretty fun. Will be a great game to play with a good friend.
