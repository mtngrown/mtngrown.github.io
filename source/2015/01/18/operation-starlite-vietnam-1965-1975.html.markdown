I had the great fortune to acquire a very reasonably priced ($30) copy of
Victory Game's "Vietnam 1965-1975." The game is almost universally
regarded as brilliant, but it's also fairly complex, and either of
the two campaign scenarios are stated to run between 100 to 200 hours of
playing time.

However, there are smaller scenarios which shipped with the game. The
smallest, an initial learning scenario modeling [Operation Starlite
August 18-24, 1965](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Starlite),
has 7 counters total. The rulebook also provides a playthrough for
the Operation Starlite scenario, which is what we're going to unpack here. 

## Overview: Vietnam 1965-1975

Typical of Victory Games, the rules are well-written and clear.

Each year in the game is divided into 4 seasons starting Spring,
then continuing through Summer, Fall and Winter. Each season is
composed of two turns, with an interseasonal phase between each season.
Each season has two turns, hence seasonal interphases occur every
other turn during the campaign games.

The full campaign game starts half way through the summer 1965 season, and can
run as long as 78 turns for a US win, shorter if the NLF achieve victory
conditions. The shorter scenarios are 1, 2, 3 and 4 turns in length, without
the seasonal interphase. As we'll see, four turns of Vietnam 1965-1975
can be a full evening's play.

Each is subdivided in a number of phases, which are further subdivided
into segments.


## Turn phases

### 1. Support Phase

The US player indicates available air, airmobile, and riverine support
on his record sheet, placing appropriate markers on the General
Record Track.

### 2. Special Operations Designation Phase

* The US player notes any units on holding or patrol operations.
* The NLF also notes units on holding or patrol operations.

### 3. Strategic Movement Phase

The US player may conduct security operations and employ strategic
and naval movement.

### 4. Operations Phase

The heart of the Vietnam *1965-1975* game is the *operation*.
The three main things to remember about operations are:

1. The NLF player always determines who performs the next operation,
   and may choose to pass in favor of the US player performing an
   operation (Section 5, page 9).
1. Each unit may perform only one operation per turn (Section 2.2, page 5). 
1. Operations proceed as a series of *rounds* until the US declines is
   unable to perform further operations. The NLF then decides to either
   continue operations or end the Operations Phase (Section 5, page 9).

Operations are explained in brief in Section 2.2, page 5, 
and described in detail in Section 5, page 9 of the rules.



#### A. Designation Segment



#### B. Support Declaration Segment

#### C. Movement Segment

#### D. Alert Segment (only in US operations)

#### E. Combat Segment

#### F. Retreat Segment

#### G. Pursuit Segment

#### H. Interdiction Removal Segment

#### I. Continuous Operations Combat Segment

Now return to Segment and and repeat until neither player is able or
willing to conduct an operation.

### 5. Game Turn Indication Phase


## Operation Starlite annotated play-by-play

## Scenario: Operation Starlite

The scenario begins and ends with the first turn of summer 1965,
and is one turn long. The play area consists of Quang Ngai in
I Corps zone.

### Setting up

#### US forces


* 5118: 3/3/3M, 2/4/3M, 155 mm artillery
* 5220: 3/7/1M, 7/1M HQ 
* 4 replacement points
* 4 air points
* 1 air mobile point
* 1 cruiser

#### NLF forces

* 5219 or 5320: 1st Regiment VC, Political Section (this game, choose hex 5219)
* 4 VC replacement points

#### Special Rules

1. NLF player may not conduct strategic movement.
1. The Movement Point Allowance for VC units is reduced by 2 for
   all purposes including movement, alert, reaction, retreat and
   pursuit. The VC were used to fighting ARVN. The USMC demonstrated
   much more flexibility and speed than the VC had experienced
   with ARVN.
1. The US player may not declare Free-Fire Zones. Free-Fire Zones are
   explained in Section 7.6, page 16 of the rule book. The idea is that
   artillery, naval and air support function at reduced effectiveness
   unless they are "free to fire" within a zone. These zones are
   declared during an operation's Support Declaration segment.
1. The US player wins if the VC regiment is dispersed, broken down,
   destroyed, or leaves the play area, but no US units are destroyed.
   If the US doesn't win, the NLF wins.


## Summer 1965

### 1. Support Phase

*The US player indicates available air, airmobile, and riverine support
on his record sheet, placing appropriate markers on the General
Record Track.*

As per set up, the US has 4 replacement points, 1 airmobile point,
4 air support points on the record track. The cruiser is placed in
hex 5217.

(The NLF replacement marker is also set to 4.)

### 2. Special Operations Designation Phase


*Both players not any units on holding or patrol operations.*

At this time, neither the US or the NLF have any units holding
or on patrol.


### 3. Strategic Movement Phase

### 4. Operations Phase

#### A. Designation Segment

#### B. Support Declaration Segment

#### C. Movement Segment

#### D. Alert Segment (only in US operations)

#### E. Combat Segment

#### F. Retreat Segment

#### G. Pursuit Segment

#### H. Interdiction Removal Segment

#### I. Continuous Operations Combat Segment

Now return to Segment and and repeat until neither player is able or
willing to conduct an operation.
