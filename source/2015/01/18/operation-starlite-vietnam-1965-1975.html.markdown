I had the great fortune to acquire a very reasonably priced ($30) copy of
Victory Game's "Vietnam 1965-1975." The game is almost universally
regarded as brilliant, but it's also fairly complex, and either of
the two campaign scenarios are stated to run between 100 to 200 hours of
playing time.

However, there are smaller scenarios which shipped with the game. The
smallest, an initial learning scenario modeling [Operation Starlite
August 18-24, 1965](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Starlite),
has 7 counters total. The rulebook also provides a playthrough for
the Operation Starlite scenario, which is what we're going to unpack here. 

## Overview: Vietnam 1965-1975

Typical of Victory Games, the rules are well-written and clear.

Each year in the game is divided into 4 seasons starting Spring,
then continuing through Summer, Fall and Winter. Each season is
composed of two turns, with an interseasonal phase between each season.
Each season has two turns, hence seasonal interphases occur every
other turn during the campaign games.

The full campaign game starts half way through the summer 1965 season, and can
run as long as 78 turns for a US win, shorter if the NLF achieve victory
conditions. The shorter scenarios are 1, 2, 3 and 4 turns in length, without
the seasonal interphase. As we'll see, four turns of Vietnam 1965-1975
can be a full evening's play.

Each is subdivided in a number of phases, which are further subdivided
into segments.


## Turn phases

### 1. Support Phase

### 2. Special Operations Designation Phase

### 3. Strategic Movement Phase

### 4. Operations Phase

#### A. Designation Segment

#### B. Support Declaration Segment

#### C. Movement Segment

#### D. Alert Segment (only in US operations)

#### E. Combat Segment

#### F. Retreat Segment

#### G. Pursuit Segment

#### H. Interdiction Removal Segment

#### I. Continuous Operations Combat Segment

Now return to Segment and and repeat until neither player is able or
willing to conduct an operation.

### 5. Game Turn Indication Phase
