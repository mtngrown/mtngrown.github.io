First Game Day at Dos Palmas. Caleb and I set up Bloody Kasserine
and got three turns into the play. Then Eriks and his friend Matt
showed up and we broke out Eldritch Horror. Seemed to go over really
well, even though the game took a really long time to get set up
and figured out.

Bloody Kasserine will be in a separate entry.
