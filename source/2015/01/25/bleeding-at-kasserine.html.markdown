(*This game actually started yesterday, Saturday January 24, 2015*.)

CC and I set up Chadwick's *Bloody Kasserine* at Dos Palmas. As usual,
I had to get warmed up a couple of turns, but started to really get
into it by turn 3.

As it turns out, I had also scheduled a game day, and we had a couple
of other folks show up right at the start of Turn 4, so the game is
getting recorded and shelved for the moment.

As usual, I did not take any notes on game play when playing with
an opponent.
