## Impressions

Not bad. Learned some bite-sized history. It seems to play longer than Soviet
Dawn, which is particularly efficient at killing you off really fast. In this
game, it feels easier to hold on, until everything craps out at once. However,
that could be the luck of the draw on this game, not playing it quite correctly,
and not really caring to beat the system (just wanted to get enough of a play
through to get familiar with some of the details).

One odd aspect of this game is that, despite shuffling, I went through most of the
morning deck before adding the day cards, then all the way through the stack until
the second to last card (the game loser) before adding the evening deck. That doesn't
happen very often in these games.

I'll definitely play this again, probably without as much detail listed as shown
above. Writing everything out sure helps comprehension, but it does slow down
game play quite a bit.
