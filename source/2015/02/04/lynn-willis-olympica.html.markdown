Back in the late 70s and early 80s, Austin-based Metagaming issued
a series of "microgames" of varying quality. Supposedly, Olympica is
one of their better microgames. The designer, Lynn Willis, is also
known for "Bloodtree Rebellion," which evidently had a strong influence
on Nick Karp's "Vietnam 1965-1975."

Lacking any better notion of what to do, here's my initial setup
for a solo game:

{:.center}
![Olympica Initial Setup](/images/olympica/g1_setup.jpg)

The red-orange hexes containing "hills" are *incline* hexes. The
yellow hexes with three waves are *cliff* hexes. The yellow hexes
with stipples in the middle area is the "caldera" portion where the
web generator must be located.

The flipped counters are the web faction, the white face up counters
are the UN faction. The map was downloaded from the web, very nice
other than missing three hexes of cliff in one spot.

Before getting started, let's jot down some notes on turn sequence
and related rules.

### Turn sequence

##### C. Reinforcement Phase

#### III. Advance Turn Marker

## Turn 1

Let's get this started.

#### I. Web player

##### A. Compulsion Phase

* Section 14.2 p. 16 deals with drop compulsion. One drop is within 2
hexes, so the web moves them back 3 hexes, putting all the units in the
drop into two incline and one cliff hexes. Rolling for avalanche, 5,
no avalanche. Drop is safe, albeit the movement restrictions on incline
and hex put these units out of action.

* Sections 19. and 19.2, p. 20 define regular compulsion. Web chooses to
move one of the Laser Tanks 3 spaces into incline hexes.

##### B. Tunnel Phase

No tunneling this game.

##### C. Reinforcement Phase

No reinforcements yet.

##### D. Movement Phase

Section 7.0, p. 9 of the rules for movement, Section 11, p. 12
for Close Assaults.

In this turn, 56web units are going for close assault.

1. Roll 5, DE.
1. Roll 1, pass to defender, roll 5 attacker eliminated. Which was good for
   UN as this was a Laser Tank.
1. Roll 5, DE. 
1. Oops, this was a strong point, should not have been moved, now exposed.
1. Roll 6, one Laser Tank eliminated.
1. Roll 4, heavy infantry eliminated.

So, 4 UN units eliminated at the cost of 1 Web unit. Bummer for UN.

I can see how this plays out I think, it's all about positioning for that
close assault, with the web having some advantage due to freely moving
through all terrain.

##### E. Ranged Combat Phase

Section 10, p. 11.

1. 2:1 roll 1, AR2, this clears a bunch of Web forces away allowing
   possible UN advance to Web Generator. Web forces could have used
   Strongpoint on this attack, but overlooked it (blunder).
1. 1:1 Strongpoint on Laser Tank, roll 6, exchange. In this case, the SP
   is eliminated because it is within the laser tanks range.
1. 2:1 roll 4, DR2, light infantry unit moved away from action.
1. 4:1 roll 4, DE.


##### F. DUST Removal Phase

Remove DUST markers placed in previous turn, not this turn.

This thing is bloody.


#### II. U.N. Player


##### A. Drop Phase

Since UN player dropped all unit during setup, there is nothing
to drop for this phase.


##### B. Movement Phase

Get in close to the Web Generator.
One unit decided to CAT an SP but rolled avalanche (6) on cliff
entry. Bummer. Two Close Assaults:

1. Roll 5, DE.
1. Roll 2, DR2, moved Web force directly away from Generator.

##### C. Ranged Combat Phase

1. 4:1 roll 4, DE.
1. 2:1 roll 4, DR2.


##### D. DUST Removal Phase

Nothing to remove on first turn.

##### E. Second Movement Phase and Close Assaults.

Light infantry get to move and CAT again. This is good to know,
makes LI worth having and spending wisely instead of using for
cannon fodder.

Here's what the end of Turn 1 looks like:

As usual, I have time to play mostly in the evening or at night,
when getting pictures is really hard. It's very difficult to
control the shadows.

## AAR and impressions

I'm playing this again with AW in a few days. He's made noises about
building a "large" copy of this game, which, given his Iron Mountain
Ogre build, might be pretty impressive. We'll see. It will be fun to
play an opponent in any case.
