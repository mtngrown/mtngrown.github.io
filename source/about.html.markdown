# Conflict Simulation

Hey, are you sure you're in the right place?

I hope so, because what we're doing here is exciting!

See, the state of conflict simulation board gaming - wargaming - is
both incredibly exciting, and stupendously behind the times.

The exciting part is that people continue to play and develop old
classics such as PanzerBlitz and Ogre. The cumulative amount of fan
activity reaching back into the early 70s is truly inspiring.

On the other hand, *none of it is well-curated!*

Everything is strewn about the web haphazardly. Sites which haven't been
updated since the late 1990s, side by side with sites which are
maintained, but look like they're stuck in the 1990s.

Furthermore, the intellectual property situation for many titles is
unclear, to put it politely. Some games, such as Ogre, have benefitted
from active protection, and allowed the game designer to profitably
reissue, and maintain some semblance of order with respect to the canon.

Other games have not had such luck. In fact, some trademarks may be at
risk (or already lost) due to negligence of the trademark holders.

Can we, the fans and players do about this situation?

Sure!

But first, you're probably wondering who I am, so let's deal with that
first.

## Who is mtngrown?

Nobody.

Yep, I'm a nobody, and everything here should be considered ill-informed
opinion.

I'm not a war gaming expert. In fact, up until late 2013, I hadn't
played any board games (much less war games) at all in over 35 years. 

My primary motivation for writing this site is 95% personal. Writing
helps me learn new and difficult concepts. Writing helps me remember
things I would otherwise forget. Writing is fun for me, even if no one
reads what I write.

My secondary motivation, the remaining %5, is to encourage gamers in
general, and war gamers specifically, to open source as much of their
activity as feels reasonable. Or perhaps even a tiny bit more than what
feels reasonable...push the comfort zone just a bit.

To that end, and as explained below, everything I produce on the 
site is open sourced under a liberal Creative Commons license.
Material which is posted for convenience belongs to respective copyright
holders.

## Taking action

First, always respect copyrights and trademarks. Nobody gets rich
selling wargames, but respecting the owner of the IP allows continued
development over time.

Second, if you're publishing or promoting fan-derived works (this would
be referred to a "fanfic" in literature), recognize that you do *not*
own rights to the trademark without being specifically granted such
rights. There would be lawyers involved.

However, you *do* own copyright on your own work.

And this is where it gets interesting.

The vast amount of derived work on games is implicitly copyrighted All
Rights Reserved, and often *explicitly* copyrighted All Rights Reserved.
The derived works are usually disseminated in proprietry formats such as
Microsoft Word or PDF, and images as low quality JPG or PNG.

In other words, the work solely depends on the author, and with
proprietary formats, related work has to be created completely
from scratch.

That changes here.

Everything (excepting explicitely trademarked material) is given to you
under a liberal Creative Commons license. The text is all Markdown with
Haml and CSS layout. The images, whereever possible, are SVG. You are
free to:

* Fork this repository for yourself.
* Create new works based on the text and images in this repository.

  as long as it meets the spirit and style of the project.

Sometimes, you can't

There is always objection from people who have invested in a
community where the copyright or trademark holder refuses to develop or
release, essentially holding a game hostage.

Let them.

They can't eat it, there are thousands of great games out there, and
increasingly, game developers who would be delighted to have someone
riff off their work to help grow a vibrant community.

When a game is held hostage, it's their loss, not yours.
