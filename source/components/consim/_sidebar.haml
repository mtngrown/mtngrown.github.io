      More PanzerBlitz. Situation 11 has not seen
      any plays at all, and Situation 7 only a single play. Situations 8, 10
      and 12 have only been played FtF, without a detailed writeup.

      Panzer Leader is coming!

      The next new game will most likely be Chadwick's Bloody Kasserine.
      Chadwick's games are classic hex-and-counter. Typically, a few pages
      of rules provide for surprisingly deep game play.

      Compass Games ran a sale recently, and Bataan! was acquired.
      Introductory scenarios will hit the table after the Central
      America excursion. Unlike most of the classics played so far,
      this game is still in shrink.

    The game collection is growing, perhaps a little too rapidly.
    Stay tuned for more reports.

  :markdown
    When there is an odd man out:

    * Have a solo game ready to play.
    * Keep score or advise on a game in progress.
    * Referee a game in progress.
