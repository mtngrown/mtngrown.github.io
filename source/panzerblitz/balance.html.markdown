# Balance in PanzerBlitz Situations

What makes for a balanced game?

That's a good question, and most players would probably agree on
something like this:

*A "balanced" game is one where each player has a equal chance of
winning based on skill.*

This works in games where chance is involved because "playing the odds"
is also a matter of skill, and to the extent of chance's influence,
skill will expose the better player over a number of games. In other
words, luck favors the better player.

In PanzerBlitz, each side is given an order of battle and victory
conditions, and a limited number of turns to achieve victory.

So how is an equal chance of winning determined?

That's an excellent question, and one without a simple answer. The
problem is asymmetry of forces, which cannot be totally accounted
for by adding up points representing unit strength. The Russian player
has very tough infantry, and must play to the strength of that infantry.
The German player must employ speed and armor.

It stands to reason that changing either the order of battle (OOB) or the
victory conditions will change the balance of the situation. In some
cases, increasing or decreasing the number of turns may also affect the
victory conditions.

In some situations, it feels like initial setup or very early game play
has an enormous influence on the outcome, such that if the opposing
player can exploit a weakness early on, the game may tip in that
player's favor.

In other words, some scenarios appear highly imbalanced, favoring one
side or another within the number of turns given in the situation. But
this imbalance may be a result of superior early positioning of that
side. Should the "stronger" side deploy poorly, the game might well swing
radically to the "weaker" side's favor.



## Situation #1

Favors Germans with PL spotting, favor Russians with PB spotting.
This is an excellent case where a slight change in rules tips the
results in an opposite direction.


### Rebalancing

Add tanks to Russians, remove mines/blocks from Germans, take away one
or both 88 mm from German, replace with 76 mm. Remove one fortification
from German, forcing a command post in the clear. Increase the turn
length to 15 to allow Russians to optimize positioning.

The difficulty rebalancing this situation is that a slight advantage to
the Russians could drastically affect the results. Make a fortification
a little too easy to crack, and the Russians may destroy two.

### Winning strategy

The Russians *must* find a way to destroy at least one command post.
This requires getting into position to pound on a fortification for
several turns, while taking 88 mm fire at point blank.

Positioning is everything for the Germans, as they are for the most
part, immobile.

### Victory conditions

These situations need to be replayed to get a better grip on balance and
victory conditions.

----

## Situation #2

Favors Russians, heavily. The Russian infantry does not move fast, but
it's very difficult to completely stop. There is so much cover requiring
spotting, and any unit getting close enough to destroy Russian infantry
companies puts itself at serious risk of dangerous close assault.
Nevertheless, there are a lot of options for rebalancing Situation #2.

### Rebalancing

Several easy modifications allow a much better balanced scenario. Here
are a few ideas.

* Add infantry or armor to German's forces.
* Use optional indirect fire rules with an added H class weapon for Germans.
* Reduce Russian infantry strength by 2 or more companies.

### Winning strategy

For the Germans, the winning strategy is getting as far forward as fast
as possible, and force the Russians to fight for every hex. There is no
way to *stop* the Russian onslaught. The best the Germans can do is
attempt to slow it down while the turn clock ticks.

For the Russians, just the opposite: it's imperative to get enough
infantry as far south as possible as early as possible so that the
advance doesn't get bogged assaulting the German blocking forces.

The Russians have a compelling case for using the gullies to avoid being
overrun while moving south, with the added benefit of concealment.

The Germans, faced with Russians in gullies, may need to park some
sacrificial panzers in the gullies to slow down the advance. This may
cost some German armor, but it may not, and every hex counts.

### Victory conditions

* Require Russians to advance further for each victory condition, say 9 or
  10 hexes for marginal victory. Alternatively, shorten the turn limit
  by one or two moves, forcing the Russians to make riskier moves.
  Either of these modifications are the easiest to implement. 
* Rewrite victory conditions as point-based, accounting for units destroyed,
  Russian units in position, and units disabled on last turn. This is
  the most complex modification, but done correctly, could provide a lot
  of insight into the scenario mechanics.

Overall, Situation #2 is an excellent scenario, and for a new player
working through the scenarios in order, will be an eye-opener on just
how tough those Russian infantry companies are.

----


## Situation #3

Situation #3 is a "breakthrough-type" scenario, where the Germans have
to clear a 3-hex wide line through the Russian defense.

Favors Russians, apparently very strongly as the PzKw III Gs cannot
muster enough firepower to affect Russian infantry, and there isn't
enough German infantry to push back. Hence, all the Russian need to do
to win is stack infantry with artillery in wooded or town hexes, and the
Germans will be lucky to dislodge even one.

### Rebalancing

Several things could be done, either by reducing Russian OOB
or increasing German OOB:

For the Russian, one of the following would probably work:

* Remove Russian infantry units, either both Guards, or both SMG, or one
  each Guard or SMG, or 3 rifle companies. The guard units are
  impossible to dislodge in this scenario, and the SMG units have a
  *lot* of firepower (AF 8).
* Remove one truck, or 3 wagons from the OOB. Because the Russians do
  not know where the Germans will try and break through, they need to
  start the game with some poweful units mounted and ready to move to
  wherever the Germans are going. Remove the wheels, and the infantry
  isn't going anywhere fast.
* Remove one ATG and one howitzer or mortar. This will require the
  infantry to fill in the gaps which would otherwise be covered by
  these units.

For the German player, try:

* Add another PzKw III G and 3 more platoons of infantry.
* Add add an engineer unit to the German's OOB (check to see if
  this is historically viable). Given the Germans deployed
  engineer units, having one in the inevitable close assaults on
  the Russian infantry might really help even up the scenario.
* Have reinforcements enter Board 2 on Turn 3 (or 4 or 5, whatever
  produces the best result). These might be the above-mentioned
  PzKw III G units, or could be PzKw III D, or PzKw II. If infantry
  are introduced for reinforcement, have them enter dismounted, forcing
  the German player to detail a few trucks or tracks to get them into
  battle. A side effect of this will be to expose any German ATG or
  mortar units which are emplaced far forward.
* Add two more 82 mm mortars. (Unfortunately for this 1941 scenario,
  the 122 mm mortar would not be introduced until 1942.) These tiny
  units can reach way, way out and really hurt Russian transport units.

Alternatively, Alan Arvold offers a historically accurate German OOB
featuring 14 instead of 5 AFVs. Under the original specification for
this situation, these extra armor units should help balance the battle.

### Winning strategy

For the Russians, starting the game with everything possible already
mounted lets most mounted units get into play by Turn 3. It's really
important for the Russians to maintain their line. If too many units are
pulled off the defensive line and trucked over to the where the Germans
are attempting to penetrate, the risk is losing fire coverage.

The Germans need to destroy as much transport as possible as early
as possible, before the Russians get the infantry into position to
push. While hunting down transport, the Germans also need to locate
and destroy as many Russian long range guns and mortars.

Also, the Germans need to find a position which holds a clear
line in their rear, while blocking the Russians. Given the defensive
strength and offensive weakness of the Russian infantry, while the
Russians can't be easily dislodged, neither can they easily destroy a
stack of German units in a favorable position.

### Victory conditions

Situation #3 is a pretty good scenario in one respect: two good players ought
to be able to produce a draw. The Germans, if they can destroy enough
H and M, force the Russian infantry to move, which may leave holes in
their line elsewhere on the map. However, if they don't move that 
infantry, the Russians risk a German breakthrough.

Hence, a likely outcome is the Russian leaving one or more small holes
(1 or 2 hexes uncovered by fire) in their line while denying the
Germans a 3 hex strip of cleared corridor. That is, a draw.

For the original OOB, victory conditions could be adjusted to the
following:

* Marginal German victory: break the Russians defensive line
  in one or more hexes anywhere on the map.
* Tactical German victory: achieve 3 hex corridor with Russian line 
  intact everywhere else.
* Decisive German victory: achieve 3 hex corridor and break the Russian
  line in one or more hexes elsehwere.

* Marginal Russian victory: hold the line intact while denying the
  German corridor and losing more than 10 units.
* Tactical Russian victory: deny Germans, hold the line intact, lose
  more than 5 but less than 10 units.
* Decisive Russian victory: hold the line, deny the Germans, lose 5 or
  less units.

These conditions are fair because the Russian player, with diligence,
can maintain the line by simply positioning units to compensate every
turn. If the Russian player does not pay attention to units not in the
action, the player may not notice when the line breaks over a hex in
one or more places.

As a variant, the Russians could add the number of German units
destroyed. Points could be subtracted for each hex found uncovered by
fire at the end of the game. (This should be a very expensive option for
the Russians.)

For yet another variant, "covered by fire" could be defined as hexes
being covered by artillery fire only, or by artillery fire and close
assault range of infantry. This removes the ranged fire of the Russian
infantry, making it harder for to cover the line, and harder to move
infantry around with without adverse consequences.

Going further, the strength of line might be considered by requiring a
certain minimum number of attack factors be brought to bear on each hex.

For a rebalanced scenario, one which a German player might win, the
marginal German victory could be establishing a 3 hex corridor, while
tactical and decisive victories could be 4 to 6 hex corridor, and 7 hex
corridor, respectively.

Also, swamps could count against cleared hexes, and any corridor
incorporating hexes on the edge of the board might have to be one or two
hexes wider to acheive victory.



### Variations

Try the following:

* Rearrange the map boards in order and aspect, then replay the scenario
  and see how it changes.
* Use the same OOB with 3 boards selected at random from the ImStrat
  boards.

## Situation #4

From Avalon Hill's "The General" magazine (v. 11, #6, p. 14) in an article
entitled "The Professional Russian," Situation #4
is described as hopelessly tilted to the Russians. On the other hand,
The General published a Series Replay (v. 12, #2, p. 20) for Situation #4
which resulted in a clear draw. The article further asserted the odds
were 50% Russian win, 25% German win, 25% draw.

Let's play it and see.

### Rebalancing

The first game play (solitaire) resulted in a marginal Russian victory.
The game felt like it could go either way almost to the end. However,
there was a blunder in setup: two German SMGs were added to the OOB,
which allowed one of the German ATGs to make an extra kill, and occupied
some Russian infantry (requiring them to dismount) which essentially
removed them from Russian victory point accumulation.

If having a couple more infantry units proves to better balance the
German forces, it might be worth altering the situations OOB
accordingly.


### Winning strategy

The Germans need to bottle up the Russians as early as possible, making
the Russians earn every hex while conserving their own forces. At some
point, the Germans will need to fall back and allow some Russian
advance, else risk a decisive rupture of their defensive line.

The Russians need to disrupt the German line as quickly as possible and
acquire what little defensible terrain exists on Board 3 as quickly as
possible.

### Victory conditions

Given the Series Replay article mentioned above correctly estimates 50%
Russian win, 25% German win and 25% draw, the victory conditions could
award the draw as a marginal German victory.


### Variations

The playing boards for Situation #4 link end-to-end. Finding a table
which is close to six feet long might be difficult for many people. I
don't have one myself. One way to mitigate this is play the scenario on
just Boards 2 and 3. Alternatively, the ends of Boards 2 and 1 can be
folded under resulting in half boards. This way, it's possible to follow
the action across the boards using just the parts needed.

Another variation might be specifying objectives for the Russians, such
as occupying Grabyosh and Opustochenia for two consecutive turns. This
would probably require rebalancing the forces, specifically, reducing
the German forces slightly to allow the Russians to penetrate.
Alternatively, the Germans could enter on Board 3 or Board 1, or set up
a token force on Board 1 prior to a Russian first move.

---


## Situation #5

The Russians established a bridgehead at Lutezh in early 1943, and
Situation #5 simulates a German reconnaissance in force against the
Russian bridgehead. Lutezh is 15-20 kilometers north of Kiev on the
Dnieper River, probably on the west bank of the river as everything east
of Lutezh for several kilometers is now flooded by the Kiev Reservoir.


### Rebalancing

Short answer: Remove one or two rifle companies, one or two artillery
batteries and a couple of wagons or trucks from the Russian OOB.
Frankly, the Russians didn't need to do much more than position rifle
companies to deny ground to the Germans, which would bog down into
ineffective direct fire on the Russians, and go-for-broke close assaults
on the Germans. Also, consider removing one or more blocks or mines from
Russian OOB.

Conversely, to the German OOB, add 2-3 infantry platoons, or 1-2
engineer units to help with removing mines and getting close assault
benefits.

### Winning strategy

As written, if the Germans don't have all candidate units off the east
side of Board 2 by the end of Turn 5 (Turn 4, really), they might as
well concede. By the time they get back on the board on Turn 8, it's
almost impossible to get back through the Russian line.

The Germans may want to keep the Wespes way in the rear, and focus on
using the halftracks and CPs to spot Russian units.

The Russians don't even need to fight that much, just set up the mines
and blocks, and shove rifle companies everywhere else. This practically
guarantees the Germans will get bogged down slugging it out with Russian
infantry.

Smart players will work out all the routes across Board 1 in advance.
The Germans need to know the fastest terrain for crossing, and the
Russian need to deny that fast terrain.


### Victory conditions

The easiest way to rebalance is probably adjust the victory conditions:

* Require Germans to leave play for 1 or 2 turns instead of 3.
* Have the victory condition be finding cover on Board 3 instead of
  exiting. Or just having enough units on Board 3 after the Russians
  on Turn 12.
* Extend the game a couple more turns, from 12 to say, 15 turns. This
  would not necessarily make it "easier" for the Germans to win, but it
  might make it possible.

### Variations

This scenario would be an excellent candidate for using one of the
ImStrat river maps. The German reconnaissance units could have as part
of a victory condition requirements to get all the way to the river,
then back through the Russian line and on to Board 3. The turn length
should probably increase to 15. Further enhancements could include the
Germans establishing a supply depot at some point on Board 1, and
removing mines.

## Situation #6

Another "long board" scenario, requiring 60" to lay out all three boards
end to end. That's a lot of inches. Too many for most tables. However,
the friendly local game store has tables *almost* long enough, and
besides, the boards can often be folded and unfolded as the game play
proceeds.

Situation #6 models a delaying action. As has been repeatedly
demonstrated, it's really hard to actually *stop* a Russian advance, but
it's entirely feasible to slow it down.

In this scenario, the Germans are grossly out numdered, and the
two SPA platoons (Wespe and Hummel) will have a hard time finding
targets which can be both spotted and correctly ranged.


### Rebalancing

Situation #6 as played in these two games feels relatively
well-balanced. On the one hand, it's tough for the Germans to get the
long range SPA effectively employed, and difficult to acquire other
kills, on the other hand, with a bit of care, the Germans can generally
stay well out of reach from the Russians, choosing when and where to
sacrifice units.

But the Russians have so many units, which puts a lot of pressure on the
Germans. Any German standing to fight risks being swarmed by T-34s.

### Winning strategy

For the Germans, slow the Russian advance as early as possible,
sacrificing pieces as necessary to block roads and clear terrain.

For the Russians, advance as fast as possible to grab and hold terrain
which would otherwise bottleneck the column.

### Victory conditions

Victory conditions for the Russians are easily adjusted by requiring
either more or less units moving on to Board 3 by the last turn.

Victory conditions for the Germans are a bit more problematic. The
original conditions (double the Russian take from the German loss) feel
contrived.

Another way to count victory conditions is using the counts of Russian units
left on both Boards 1 & 2. If the Russians manage to get 10 or more
units on to Board 3 at the expense of leaving units on Board 1, that
could count against them. This would be a very different tactical
situation from the Russians getting all of the forces off of Board 1 and
under cover on Board 2.

---

## Situation #7

Apparently, Situation #7 is regarded as the worst scenario shipping in
the original PanzerBlitz box. This alone provides a bit of intrigue. The
general notion is that the game either runs to stalemate very quickly,
or favors the Germans as they essentially acheive their victory
conditions by Turn 2.

### Rebalancing

One way to investigate a better balanced scenario would be to have the
Russians come in from the east and the Germans from the west, opposite
of the current scenario.

Alternatively, specify the Russians as having first movement.

By the start of Russian Turn 3, it's looking really grim for the
Russians, specifically, facing a concealed Wespe on Hill 129 makes
motion on the north end of Board 3 really problematic.

It might be that having more than 10 turns helps even things out as
well.

Another way might be to add a few units to the Russian OOB, or remove a
couple from the German, or both.

### Winning strategy

For the Germans, move onto Board 2 as fast as possible, hunker down.

For the Russians, position units to apply concentrated force on selected
German targets, trading units at better than 1:1.

### Victory conditions

The game starts with a de facto German victory, since the Germans start
with at least as many pieces as the Russians.

The scenario is designed to force Russian offensive action. The Russians
cannot win this with the usual tactic of emplacing unkillable infantry
to block German action.

One way to make victory conditions a little more interesting is to
require the Germans to hold some real estate. The Germans were able to
minimize losses up until they decided to fight, which lost them the
game. A better balanced scenario might have a few less Russian tanks,
with a requirement that the Germans must hold one or more towns or
hills. (This opinion is based on one game, where neither Wespe or Hummel
got into play.)

---

## Situation #8

Another tough situation for the Germans, especially if playing strictly
by the standard rules, without optional call-for-fire for SPAs and other
indirect fire weapons.

### Rebalancing

This is one scenario where using the optional ``any German unit can call
for indirect fire'' rule might make a lot of sense.

If allowing any German unit to call in any artillery is to liberal,
allow platoon level units to call in the lighter artillery and mortar
units, and limit the SPA indirect fire to command posts. The command
posts, in turn, could be allowed to call fire while ``mounted'' on
halftracks.

Alternatively, or along with allowing all Germans to call in fire, reduce
the number of mines and blocks allowed to the Russians.

One of the difficulties the Germans have in all scenarios with Russian
emplaced mines is what to do with any engineer units? Should the
engineers attempt to clear mines, or should they work with regular
infantry to get that odds shift for close assault?

More balancing ideas

* Reduce the number of guards units by 2 or 3
* Allow the German player "perfect information" on where units are
  positioned, that is, examine stacks and what's under forts.

### Winning strategy

The Germans *must* get indirect fire working. Specifically, getting the
command posts into spotting positions for the SPA is really critical. It
needs to be done as fast as possible.

The Russians, on the other hand, need not do much more than throw
infantry into the few lanes across the map not covered by mines and
blocks, then bring the armor around while the Germans attempt to clear
the infantry.

### Victory conditions

As in other scenarios requiring exiting units from the board to
determine victory levels, the number of units required to leave can be
adjusted up or down. Alternatively, the number of turns can be increased
or reduced.

---

## Situation #9

### Rebalancing

### Winning strategy

### Victory conditions

---

## Situation #12

Tables turned, Russians need to clear a lane and advance through the
teeth of some stiff German opposition. And this time, the Germans can
easily position command posts for directing SPA fire.

### Rebalancing

For an inexperienced Russian player going up against an experienced
German player, removing some or all of the mines and blocks will give
the Russian player a lot more options for driving across the board.

### Winning strategy

For the Russians, driving as fast as possible to get into the SPA
indirect fire blind zone, and taking out the command posts are critical.

For the Germans, just the opposite: protect the CPs and the SPA as long
as possible to slow up the Russian advance.


### Victory conditions

Again, adjusting the number of units which can exit is a great way to
handicap players of unequal skill.

country, U.S. tank units who were engaged at range from German defensive
positions sometimes took 50% casualties before spotting where the fire
was coming from.[40 Tank Tactics from Normandy to Lorraine]

## Playing to a draw

The original rules do not discuss fighting to a draw, but adding a
"draw" outcome might help balance situations. With tiered victory
conditions, when both sides achieve the same victory condition, that's a
draw.
