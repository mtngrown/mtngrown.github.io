# Situation #8 Russian Organized Defense: German Relief on the Korsun Pocket

This is solitaire game 1 for Situation #8. I've played it once before
with an experienced wargamer who hadn't played PanzerBlitz in decades,
and his Russians smoked my Germans pretty bad.

Setting up for this game, now that I have the time, it's making me
wonder how he was able to get all those heavy mortar shots off, given
the 4 hex spotting for Russian command post, for the 120 mm mortars
only. I seem to recall him spotting out much longer ranges, and spotting
for the heavy howitzer as well. This would make a huge difference in
game play, and would certainly go a long way towards explaining why the
Germans never even got halfway across board one in 8 turns, much less
off Board 3 in 10 turns.

Of course, it didn't help that my opponent got *very* lucky on a die
roll and took out a stack of AFVs which I negligently left exposed.
That and a CAT taking out a stack of PzKpfw IVs in a later turn
(but that was a calculated risk, which I lost.)

Hopefully, in this solo game, I'll be able to figure out what went wrong
in that game. Or not.


## Setting up

The Russians set up first on Board 1. The strategy is to make it hard
for the Germans to even get on the board using mines and blocks, then
once they're on the board, hammer them with the artillery concealed on
hill tops, while moving the guards and rifle units along the road to
assume blocking positions if and when the Germans break through.

The Germans have to pick what they think will be the softest point of
the Russian defensive line, and hammer on it very hard.


### Scenario specific rules for indirect fire

The situation description states that Russian "CP's may only spot for
120mm mortar (within 4 hexes.)" For this game, the assumption will be
that the CP needs to be within 4 hexes of the mortar it calls fire for,
but otherwise may call for fire on anything spotted in the CP's line of
sight. CPs may call for fire more than once each turn. For example, if
there are three mortars and two CPs, one of the CPs may call for fire
for two mortars.

This is a hole in the rules, and should probably be addressed by either 1.
limiting call for fire onto a single target per (6 minute) turn, or 2.
adding a clause to indirect fire rules increasing the amount of drift
on each target when a CP is calling fire on more than one target.

German indirect fire will follow optional indirect fire rules
as defined in \S 10.1.

### Initial position

Here's the eagle eye view:

![Initial positions for Situation #8](/images/pb_situation_8_setup.jpg)

The image is muddy due to low light and iPhone camera, but the basic
elements are clear.


* The Germans place 1 CP forward, to direct fire on the Russian rifle,
with infantry to follow with CAT if necessary. The engineers will move
forward to take out the mines in the ford.

* Russian infantry are deployed along the road to Uschas. While infantry
is ordinarily slow with 1 MF unmounted, road bonus grants 2 MF. This may
not seem like much, but when you're a German, and you're stuck in a
gully and dispersed between Hills 135 and 123, 2 MF/turn is
distressingly fast. These units are far enough west to stay in play no
matter where the Germans attempt to force through.

Detailed photos and explanations follow.

The north end of the map is fairly well sealed off, as most of the clear
terrain can be covered with the heavy mortars, the pesky swamp funnels
enemy vehicles into the maw of the howitzer lurking in Uschas.

The Russians have made another blunder here by not putting at least one
Rifle or Guards company in the middle forest. An infantry unit here
would be exceedingly difficult for the Germans to kill, as lines of
sight are very poor, and most good observation points are well covered
by the mortars on Hill 135. However, the infantry units deployed along
the Uschas road will move to seal off rear areas.

The Germans are going to attempt to outflank the Russians using armor to
swing around the north of Hill 135. Getting AFVs in the Russian rear
would be positively pestilential to Russian plans.

The Russian infantry reserve is lined up under cover along the western
road loading north to Uschas. The mortars and command posts establish
fields of fire covering most of boards 1 and 3. These need to be
protected.

The Russian mortar companies have an MF of 1. These companies deployed
on the west have an option to quickly (3 turns) take the road to
Opustchenia, where they can harass German transports striking out onto
board 3. While they are almost certain to be lost, just having them in
Opustchenia should cost the Germans 1 or 2 units, and possibly a full
turn of movement to exit.

The SU-85 are in reserve to (hopefully) counteract blatant attempts by
the Germans to drive armor directly to the Russian rear.

In all, west of Hill 135 is the middle of the fighting area. Units
deployed here are protected from emplaced German mortars on the Bednost
mesa, and can move north or south as the situation dictates.

German infantry and engineers mass at the eastern ford to eliminate
potential spotting units and remove the mine from the ford.

Below, you can see the Germans getting ready to exploit a hole in the
Russian line at hex 1E3, which will put the Germans on the road, in
cover and unspotted, hence protected against the mortars on Hill 135.

At some point, I'll start using VASSAL. Currently, it puts too much of
a load on my system to be comfortable to use.

The first thing to note is that this situation can take quite a while
for the Russian player to set up. For a first time player, budget an
hour for the Russian. It's almost guaranteed analysis paralysis.
The German play will also need some time to set up, probably about 30
minutes *after* the Russians are finished. These set up times decrease
with experience, and with multiple plays of the scenario.
