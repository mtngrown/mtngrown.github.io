# Situation #8 Russian Organized Defense: German Relief on the Korsun Pocket

This is solitaire game 1 for Situation #8. I've played it once before
with an experienced wargamer who hadn't played PanzerBlitz in decades,
and his Russians smoked my Germans pretty bad.

Setting up for this game, now that I have the time, it's making me
wonder how he was able to get all those heavy mortar shots off, given
the 4 hex spotting for Russian command post, for the 120 mm mortars
only. I seem to recall him spotting out much longer ranges, and spotting
for the heavy howitzer as well. This would make a huge difference in
game play, and would certainly go a long way towards explaining why the
Germans never even got halfway across board one in 8 turns, much less
off Board 3 in 10 turns.

Of course, it didn't help that my opponent got *very* lucky on a die
roll and took out a stack of AFVs which I negligently left exposed.
That and a CAT taking out a stack of PzKpfw IVs in a later turn
(but that was a calculated risk, which I lost.)

Hopefully, in this solo game, I'll be able to figure out what went wrong
in that game. Or not.


## Setting up

The Russians set up first on Board 1. The strategy is to make it hard
for the Germans to even get on the board using mines and blocks, then
once they're on the board, hammer them with the artillery concealed on
hill tops, while moving the guards and rifle units along the road to
assume blocking positions if and when the Germans break through.

The Germans have to pick what they think will be the softest point of
the Russian defensive line, and hammer on it very hard.


### Scenario specific rules for indirect fire

The situation description states that Russian "CP's may only spot for
120mm mortar (within 4 hexes.)" For this game, the assumption will be
that the CP needs to be within 4 hexes of the mortar it calls fire for,
but otherwise may call for fire on anything spotted in the CP's line of
sight. CPs may call for fire more than once each turn. For example, if
there are three mortars and two CPs, one of the CPs may call for fire
for two mortars.

This is a hole in the rules, and should probably be addressed by either 1.
limiting call for fire onto a single target per (6 minute) turn, or 2.
adding a clause to indirect fire rules increasing the amount of drift
on each target when a CP is calling fire on more than one target.

German indirect fire will follow optional indirect fire rules
as defined in \S 10.1.

### Initial position

Here's the eagle eye view:

{:.center}
![Initial positions for Situation #8](/images/pb_situation_8_setup.jpg)

The image is muddy due to low light and iPhone camera, but the basic
elements are clear.


* The Germans place 1 CP forward, to direct fire on the Russian rifle,
with infantry to follow with CAT if necessary. The engineers will move
forward to take out the mines in the ford.

* German transport is staged in a rear area until enough cover is
cleared to allow mounting and transport. This is primarily trucks, the
halftracks forming a vanguard to rapidly get the infantry into spotting
positions.

* Russian infantry are deployed along the road to Uschas. While infantry
is ordinarily slow with 1 MF unmounted, road bonus grants 2 MF. This may
not seem like much, but when you're a German, and you're stuck in a
gully and dispersed between Hills 135 and 123, 2 MF/turn is
distressingly fast. These units are far enough west to stay in play no
matter where the Germans attempt to force through.

Detailed photos and explanations follow.

The north end of the map is fairly well sealed off, as most of the clear
terrain can be covered with the heavy mortars, the pesky swamp funnels
enemy vehicles into the maw of the howitzer lurking in Uschas.

Close up of the units deployed around Uschas. This terrain is very
difficult for vehicles, so the Russians feel comfortable with a nominal
force to delay while reserve units move up along the western road
towards Uschas.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_uschas.jpg)

---

The Russians are relying on terrain to discourage German crossing north
of Hill 135. The gullies cost trucks 5 MF to exit, which adds a turn to
cross the board compared to crossing the hills to the south.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_marsh.jpg)

---

The Russians have made another blunder here by not putting at least one
Rifle or Guards company in the middle forest. An infantry unit here
would be exceedingly difficult for the Germans to kill, as lines of
sight are very poor, and most good observation points are well covered
by the mortars on Hill 135. However, the infantry units deployed along
the Uschas road will move to seal off rear areas.

The Germans are going to attempt to outflank the Russians using armor to
swing around the north of Hill 135. Getting AFVs in the Russian rear
would be positively pestilential to Russian plans.

---

Guards and Submachine gun companies in reserve on western road,
positioned to support Uschas if necessary. The mortars will harass
transports attempting to exit across the clear terrain on board 3.

![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_hill130.jpg)

---

The Russian infantry reserve is lined up under cover along the western
road loading north to Uschas. The mortars and command posts establish
fields of fire covering most of boards 1 and 3. These need to be
protected.

The Russian mortar companies have an MF of 1. These companies deployed
on the west have an option to quickly (3 turns) take the road to
Opustchenia, where they can harass German transports striking out onto
board 3. While they are almost certain to be lost, just having them in
Opustchenia should cost the Germans 1 or 2 units, and possibly a full
turn of movement to exit.

The SU-85 are in reserve to (hopefully) counteract blatant attempts by
the Germans to drive armor directly to the Russian rear.

In all, west of Hill 135 is the middle of the fighting area. Units
deployed here are protected from emplaced German mortars on the Bednost
mesa, and can move north or south as the situation dictates.

---

German infantry and engineers mass at the eastern ford to eliminate
potential spotting units and remove the mine from the ford.

Armor and infantry will exploit a hole in the Russian line at 1E3 to
move some infantry in on the ATG at the crossroads.

The ramifications of this is that the ATG at the crossroad is at high
risk. The Russian recon unit, which is basically doing nothing at 1E4,
should have been stacked with the ATG at 1J5. On the other hand, the
Russians can move a rifle company to stack with it.

The Russians provide a slightly more than nominal force at Adski, in
part to slow the Germans down if necessary, and the mortar to harass any
transports caught out in the open on board 3 as the Germans attempt to
escape.

Note: the German setup changed after this photo was taken. All the other
photos have the German positions as was actually played.

Below, you can see the Germans getting ready to exploit a hole in the
Russian line at hex 1E3, which will put the Germans on the road, in
cover and unspotted, hence protected against the mortars on Hill 135.

Closer look at the German initial position after setting up. The game is
now ready to play.

Creating all these photos is time consuming, but it's really handy to
have a record for future reference.
At some point, I'll start using VASSAL. Currently, it puts too much of
a load on my system to be comfortable to use.

Situation #8 is set up, let's play PanzerBlitz.

## Turn 1

Germans move first, and will swing around to the south to
1. open a lane for the trucks to get through, and 2. cut off
infantry reinforcements moving north.

Here's the end of the German phase:

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/pb_g_1.jpg)

And already I'm breaking or at least bending the rules by
having stacked armor on the road in the forest. Stacking
on roads is fine as long as the surrounding terrain costs
are paid for movement. In this case, the surrounding terrain
is "impassable" due to solid green hex sides.

I think I'm going to disallow this in the future, along with
writing up a rules summary with examples.

Here's the end of the Russian phase:

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/pb_r_1.jpg)

And that's it for Turn 1.

## Turn 2

And once again, the Germans are in a bind because they can't call for
fire to handle the Russian infantry. Neither of the CPs are in LOS of
anything useful, and it's going to take several turns to get them moved
and emplaced somewhere safe.

Fire results were disappointing, the fortification yeilded a No Effect.
The die rolled 5, which would have been a 6 accounting for forested
terrain, which would have been nothing even at 3:1 instead of 2:1 odds.

Basically, in addition to the infantry, these 8 fortifications,
emplaced on forested hilltops, are pretty much invulnerable.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_g_2.jpg)


The Russians have to kill German units to win, though, and the Germans
can make that pretty hard. So far, the best the Russians are doing is
dispersing, which isn't going to be enough.

The Germans could probably play hide-and-seek with the infantry and CPs,
and get the armor off the board for a win. Would be tough to get any of
the infantry off now, since it's all dismounted.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_r_2.jpg)

On to Turn 3.

## Turn 3

Germans a few potshots, nothing exciting happened other than the mine
finally cleared, which allowed the Germans to bring up a CP. This is
going to be really useful. Necessary in fact.

Didn't record fire for this turn. Having failed a 4:1 on a Russian rifle
company in the forest was really disappointing. That unit it clogging up
the works. The Germans have to go back and forth between keeping an
advance, versus clearing out the rear area to allow transport to move
forward.

The Russians now have a lot of targets.

## Turn 4

## Turn 5

## Turn 6

## Turn 7

## Turn 8

## Turn 9

## Turn 10


## AAR

The first thing to note is that this situation can take quite a while
for the Russian player to set up. For a first time player, budget an
hour for the Russian. It's almost guaranteed analysis paralysis.
The German play will also need some time to set up, probably about 30
minutes *after* the Russians are finished. These set up times decrease
with experience, and with multiple plays of the scenario.

Another thing I'm sure of now, from this game, is that I'm at least very
slightly biasing the game play for some of these games. It doesn't feel
overt. It seems to come out as unconscious leaning toward to making one
side or another have small advantages, which add up. A general example
might be making a sub par move, or not firing on an appropriate target.
I won't see these until after the turn finishes.

I think the effect comes from focusing on playing one side really,
really well, while just not thinking about the other side.

### Fire record

This is probably not the complete fire record, but it's some of it.

{:.center.fire-record}
turn | firing | from | to   | target | type | range | odds | results
    -|-      -|-    -|-    -|-      -|-    -|-     -|-    -|-
   1 |    G42 |  2D4 |  2K2 |   R953 |    D |  7    |  2:1 | D


### Blunders

Russians did not use their position well:

* The howitzer should bracket, one in Uschas or similar northern
emplacement, the other on the south side of the board. With range 20,
each can fire on enemy on their half of the fighting ground, while
overlapping to some extent in the middle. Having the howitzer at 1N6 is
relatively ineffective in the early game. (It may come in to play in the
later game.)

* Leaving a hole at 1E3.
* Not reinforcing the crossroad at 1J5 with that spare Recon unit.

German blunders include not getting a CP way forward into cover and
defensible terrain. On the south edge of Board 1, this means Hill 126
east of Adski.
