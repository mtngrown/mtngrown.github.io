# Situation #8 Russian Organized Defense: German Relief on the Korsun Pocket

This is solitaire game 1 for Situation #8. I've played it once before
with an experienced wargamer who hadn't played PanzerBlitz in decades,
and his Russians smoked my Germans pretty bad.

Setting up for this game, now that I have the time, it's making me
wonder how he was able to get all those heavy mortar shots off, given
the 4 hex spotting for Russian command post, for the 120 mm mortars
only. I seem to recall him spotting out much longer ranges, and spotting
for the heavy howitzer as well. This would make a huge difference in
game play, and would certainly go a long way towards explaining why the
Germans never even got halfway across board one in 8 turns, much less
off Board 3 in 10 turns.

Of course, it didn't help that my opponent got *very* lucky on a die
roll and took out a stack of AFVs which I negligently left exposed.
That and a CAT taking out a stack of PzKpfw IVs in a later turn
(but that was a calculated risk, which I lost.)

Hopefully, in this solo game, I'll be able to figure out what went wrong
in that game. Or not.


## Setting up

The Russians set up first on Board 1. The strategy is to make it hard
for the Germans to even get on the board using mines and blocks, then
once they're on the board, hammer them with the artillery concealed on
hill tops, while moving the guards and rifle units along the road to
assume blocking positions if and when the Germans break through.

The Germans have to pick what they think will be the softest point of
the Russian defensive line, and hammer on it very hard.


### Scenario specific rules for indirect fire

The situation description states that Russian "CP's may only spot for
120mm mortar (within 4 hexes.)" For this game, the assumption will be
that the CP needs to be within 4 hexes of the mortar it calls fire for,
but otherwise may call for fire on anything spotted in the CP's line of
sight. CPs may call for fire more than once each turn. For example, if
there are three mortars and two CPs, one of the CPs may call for fire
for two mortars.

This is a hole in the rules, and should probably be addressed by either 1.
limiting call for fire onto a single target per (6 minute) turn, or 2.
adding a clause to indirect fire rules increasing the amount of drift
on each target when a CP is calling fire on more than one target.

German indirect fire will follow optional indirect fire rules
as defined in \S 10.1.

### Initial position

Here's the eagle eye view:

{:.center}
![Initial positions for Situation #8](/images/pb_situation_8_setup.jpg)

The image is muddy due to low light and iPhone camera, but the basic
elements are clear.


* The Germans place 1 CP forward, to direct fire on the Russian rifle,
with infantry to follow with CAT if necessary. The engineers will move
forward to take out the mines in the ford.

* German transport is staged in a rear area until enough cover is
cleared to allow mounting and transport. This is primarily trucks, the
halftracks forming a vanguard to rapidly get the infantry into spotting
positions.

* Russian infantry are deployed along the road to Uschas. While infantry
is ordinarily slow with 1 MF unmounted, road bonus grants 2 MF. This may
not seem like much, but when you're a German, and you're stuck in a
gully and dispersed between Hills 135 and 123, 2 MF/turn is
distressingly fast. These units are far enough west to stay in play no
matter where the Germans attempt to force through.

Detailed photos and explanations follow.

---


The north end of the map is fairly well sealed off, as most of the clear
terrain can be covered with the heavy mortars, the pesky swamp funnels
enemy vehicles into the maw of the howitzer lurking in Uschas.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_north.jpg)

---

Close up of the units deployed around Uschas. This terrain is very
difficult for vehicles, so the Russians feel comfortable with a nominal
force to delay while reserve units move up along the western road
towards Uschas.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_uschas.jpg)

---

The Russians are relying on terrain to discourage German crossing north
of Hill 135. The gullies cost trucks 5 MF to exit, which adds a turn to
cross the board compared to crossing the hills to the south.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_marsh.jpg)

---

The Russians have made another blunder here by not putting at least one
Rifle or Guards company in the middle forest. An infantry unit here
would be exceedingly difficult for the Germans to kill, as lines of
sight are very poor, and most good observation points are well covered
by the mortars on Hill 135. However, the infantry units deployed along
the Uschas road will move to seal off rear areas.

The Germans are going to attempt to outflank the Russians using armor to
swing around the north of Hill 135. Getting AFVs in the Russian rear
would be positively pestilential to Russian plans.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_gullies.jpg)

---

Guards and Submachine gun companies in reserve on western road,
positioned to support Uschas if necessary. The mortars will harass
transports attempting to exit across the clear terrain on board 3.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_hill130.jpg)

---

The Russian infantry reserve is lined up under cover along the western
road loading north to Uschas. The mortars and command posts establish
fields of fire covering most of boards 1 and 3. These need to be
protected.

The Russian mortar companies have an MF of 1. These companies deployed
on the west have an option to quickly (3 turns) take the road to
Opustchenia, where they can harass German transports striking out onto
board 3. While they are almost certain to be lost, just having them in
Opustchenia should cost the Germans 1 or 2 units, and possibly a full
turn of movement to exit.

The SU-85 are in reserve to (hopefully) counteract blatant attempts by
the Germans to drive armor directly to the Russian rear.

In all, west of Hill 135 is the middle of the fighting area. Units
deployed here are protected from emplaced German mortars on the Bednost
mesa, and can move north or south as the situation dictates.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_hill135.jpg)

---

German infantry and engineers mass at the eastern ford to eliminate
potential spotting units and remove the mine from the ford.

Armor and infantry will exploit a hole in the Russian line at 1E3 to
move some infantry in on the ATG at the crossroads.

The ramifications of this is that the ATG at the crossroad is at high
risk. The Russian recon unit, which is basically doing nothing at 1E4,
should have been stacked with the ATG at 1J5. On the other hand, the
Russians can move a rifle company to stack with it.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_middle.jpg)

---

The Russians provide a slightly more than nominal force at Adski, in
part to slow the Germans down if necessary, and the mortar to harass any
transports caught out in the open on board 3 as the Germans attempt to
escape.

Note: the German setup changed after this photo was taken. All the other
photos have the German positions as was actually played.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_russian_south.jpg)

---

Below, you can see the Germans getting ready to exploit a hole in the
Russian line at hex 1E3, which will put the Germans on the road, in
cover and unspotted, hence protected against the mortars on Hill 135.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/sit_8_setup_south.jpg)

---

Closer look at the German initial position after setting up. The game is
now ready to play.

{:.center}

---

Creating all these photos is time consuming, but it's really handy to
have a record for future reference.
At some point, I'll start using VASSAL. Currently, it puts too much of
a load on my system to be comfortable to use.

Situation #8 is set up, let's play PanzerBlitz.

## Turn 1

Germans move first, and will swing around to the south to
1. open a lane for the trucks to get through, and 2. cut off
infantry reinforcements moving north.

Here's the end of the German phase:

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/pb_g_1.jpg)

And already I'm breaking or at least bending the rules by
having stacked armor on the road in the forest. Stacking
on roads is fine as long as the surrounding terrain costs
are paid for movement. In this case, the surrounding terrain
is "impassable" due to solid green hex sides.

I think I'm going to disallow this in the future, along with
writing up a rules summary with examples.

Here's the end of the Russian phase:

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/pb_r_1.jpg)

And that's it for Turn 1.

## Turn 2

And once again, the Germans are in a bind because they can't call for
fire to handle the Russian infantry. Neither of the CPs are in LOS of
anything useful, and it's going to take several turns to get them moved
and emplaced somewhere safe.

Fire results were disappointing, the fortification yeilded a No Effect.
The die rolled 5, which would have been a 6 accounting for forested
terrain, which would have been nothing even at 3:1 instead of 2:1 odds.

Basically, in addition to the infantry, these 8 fortifications,
emplaced on forested hilltops, are pretty much invulnerable.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_g_2.jpg)


The Russians have to kill German units to win, though, and the Germans
can make that pretty hard. So far, the best the Russians are doing is
dispersing, which isn't going to be enough.

The Germans could probably play hide-and-seek with the infantry and CPs,
and get the armor off the board for a win. Would be tough to get any of
the infantry off now, since it's all dismounted.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_r_2.jpg)

On to Turn 3.

## Turn 3

Germans a few potshots, nothing exciting happened other than the mine
finally cleared, which allowed the Germans to bring up a CP. This is
going to be really useful. Necessary in fact.

Didn't record fire for this turn. Having failed a 4:1 on a Russian rifle
company in the forest was really disappointing. That unit it clogging up
the works. The Germans have to go back and forth between keeping an
advance, versus clearing out the rear area to allow transport to move
forward.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_g_t3.jpg)

The Russians now have a lot of targets. In fact, to Germans great
chagrin, all 3 mortars can fire on a stack of German infantry at 3:1
odds, which is 2/6 chance of outright kill, and another 2/6 chance of
getting a dispersal. With a kill, the rifle company can advance to
close assault the Wespe.

Once again, I am have severe difficulties employing the German SPA
effectively.

First up the long range mortars to support the units guarding the
intersection. I made a huge blunder here as the Russian by combining
my fire for a single roll at 3:1 when I could have had 3 rolls at 3:1
with 1/3 chance of eliminating on each roll. Of course, the combined
attack gave 1/3 chance of eliminating the whole stack, which would have
allowed the Russian infantry to advance up the lane. Had it succeeded,
as noted above, this could have been a game-breaker for the Germans.
By failing, it's probably not a game breaker for the Russians, but it
won't make it any easier to halt the Germans.

{:.center.fire-record}

Much more fire and close assaulting occurred. The new record sheet I
created will be handy. In the meantime, using a legal pad to keep track
of firing works really well.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_r_t3.jpg)

The Russians didn't do that well on their combat, but the dispersals
they got can only help slow down the German advance.


## Turn 4

Enough of the detailed game play for now! Compared to my first efforts
back in Situation #1, I'm doing much, much better at describing game
play. I'll have to replay some of those early games with the attention
to detail I'm demonstrating here. But for now, I want this off the table
in favor of a third game of StarForce exploring Scenario 3.

Also, to be perfectly truthful, I'm a bit bored with the game at this point.
All the photos and notes are a lot of work, without a clear payoff.
Simply finishing this game has a great payoff: I can start another game!

Turn 4 opens with a couple of not unlucky 4:1 +1 drm shots from the
artillery to take out Russian infantry. It would have really hurt if I'd
rolled a 6 on either shot. Now it's time to move, and I'm not sure
exactly what I want to do yet. I've just figured out the the Russian
tanks could go romping around in the German rear area, so I better
ensure they don't get there. On the other hand, I want to ensure I get
some protection forward to gain ground. At the moment, it's about to
turn into a slug fest south of Hill 135.

Unfortunately, the not unlucky artillery shots have been followed up
with some definitely unlucky CATs: total whiff on all of them.

Time for the Russians...and let's try writing out by phases. Haven't
done this for PanzerBlitz yet.

*Fire determination and resolution*: 5 attempts: the 2 76.2 ATGs each take a shot at PzKpfw
IVs at 1:2, scoring a D on one for their efforts. The 3 120mm mortars take
another shot at the stack of German rifles at 4:1, and get an X; that's 3 units
for the Russians. The two SU-85s take 1:2  shots on the PzKpfws lurking
on the ridge east of Hill 135, score a D for their efforts. In all, not
bad results.

The actual phasing is defined by calling the shots, then resolving each
one. I wrote them up together, above, to make it easier to read.

*Vehicle movement* none, the SU-85s both fired.

*Leg and CAT*: 4 attempts, managed one dispersal of a stack of Panthers
at the south end of the Lane of Tears at 1:3 (11:32) odds. Not too bad,
could have been better.

*Dead pile*: Germans 3, Russians 5, 1 mine removed.

Almost half done with this game.

## Turn 5

The Germans still have a rough way to go, but with a couple of lucky
rolls behind them, a few more lucky rolls might just see enough units
off the Plains of Despair to acquire at least a draw.

**Fire determination and resolution**: The Hummel and StuH-42 (14-H-10)
take out a Guard unit with 5/6 chance; I've been really unlucky with
these types of shots. Panther takes on a rifle company, roll 1,
dispersed! No effect for SG-III 75 shooting at SU-85 on the hills.
German mortar on Hill 132 disperse a guards unit, critically important
as this unit is about to get overrun as well, and every little bit
helps.


**Vehicle movement & overrun**: First up, the PzKpfw overruns
the just now dispersed guards unit, elimination on roll 1. Overkill, but
why take chances with Russian infantry? The second CP moves up with the
Wespe, risking a CAT, but in the woods, this would only be a dispersal
at worst, and then only if the SMG unit which is adjacent isn't
eliminated or dispersed.

**Leg and CAT**: The engineers are finally in play, moving a 1:1 on the
SMG in the woods to a 2:1, with a roll of 2 that's an elim, and the CP
and Wespe are safe for at least Turn 6. The Germans have been hitting
some good rolls. Helps to be lucky.

I wasn't going to post any more photos of the game, but this situation
at the end of the German phase was too good to pass up:

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/sit_8_g_t5.jpg)

The Russians can still do a lot of damage to the Germans, and the
Germans have a long way to go to get across the Plains of Despair, and
an increasingly shorter time in which to cross.

However, the Russians might be in a bit of trouble here. They're losing their
infantry to heavy artillery, CATs and overruns. This is not good. And
it's not good that the Russians just don't have that much effective fire
this turn. For example, neither howitzer has any high value targets.

For example, R71 (pink die showing 2 pips) really wants to combine fire
onto the stack of SG-III 75s (G823, pink die showing single pip) on the
nearby hillside to the south, but technically has no line of site. It's
blocked by the forest green bar hex side.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/howitzer_los.jpg)

Further south, the ATG R36 (red die, 2 pips) wants to fire on G931 (red
die, 1 pip), but there is an intervening brown bar hillside closer to
G931 than R36; no LOS. One the other hand, R31 can fire on G931, but
probably not on G938. The optional rule allowing hex centers to
determine LOS could allow firing, while the standard rule would find a
green bar intervening from one the possible paths traced through hexes.

{:.center}
![FIXME](/images/panzerblitz/situation-8/atg_los.jpg)

It's not just "panzerbush," it's "panzerslope" as well.

**Fire determination & resolution**: Russians have 2 direct fire shots.
First is using heavy mortars on the SG-III on the slope at 3:1. The second is
the ATG R31 on G931 at 1:1 (12:8). For the first, roll 2 for
elimination, about time! Second, roll 5 which is a miss.

**Vehicle movement & overrun**: The SU-85s need to find a way to pick
off the Germans as they cross the Plains of Despair. Might be a good
time to decamp to Zabvenia, just to cost the Germans an extra turn.


**Leg and CAT**: The first CAT on the panzers failed, a second on some
halftracks succeeded. Leg units need to move due south to
attempt to block movement onto the Plains.

**Dead pile**: German 4, Russian 8, 1 mine removed.

Half done!

## Turn 6

It would be hard for the Russians to get a decisive victory at this
point, but it's probably just as hard for the Germans to get a marginal
victory, which is 30 units off Board 3.

**Fire determination and resolution**: Had to use barrage fire to take
out one of the fortifications. Very chancy stuff, 1/6 chance I would
have burned out the artillery for nothing. I've gotten lucky this game
on the dice. This will be helpful having one of the heavy mortars gone.
I'm now thinking I'd have spent the barrage more effectively by taking
out the CP, if I had only had a CP in line of sight for spotting.

**Vehicle movement & overrun**: at this point, I can't really hide any
more, and I'm going to have to make a run for the border. It's almost
attritional, I'm going to lose as many units per turn as the Russians
have guns. For sure, 3 units per turn, and there are 5 fire turns left
for the Russians. However, I'm leaving the Hummel behind, and the SG-III
75s to pester the Russian fortified CP. It may have been a mistake to
have moved the Wespe so far forward.

**Infantry & CAT**: Infantry is mounting up this turn. Too close to the
end of the game to do anything else.


Now for the Russians...

**Fire determination**: Only two good targets available, strangely
enough, the PzKpfw on the slope which can be dealt with by the 122mm
howitzer (finally), and the AFVs threatening the CP on Hill 135.

**Fire resolution**: For the mortars, 4:1 in woods, roll 5 for
elimination. For the howitzer, 2:1 (40/2):8, roll 3, dispersed.

**Vehicle movement & overrun**: SU-85s roll into Zabvenia.

**Infantry movement & CAT**: The infantry is moving in a pincer
formation to squeeze from both the north and the south. If the Germans
are a little bit lucky, they will squirt out like a watermelon seed,
but it will be costly. 2 CATs available, one from the north on
halftrack, the other from the south on AFVs. Both succeed in dispersals,
which is Bad News for Jerry.

**Dead pile**: German 8, Russian 9, 1 mine removed.

## Turn 7

It's appearing that moving the Wespe forward is a blunder. It's just not
getting that many shots off.

German:

**Fire determination**: Hummel took at a rifle company, another rifle
dispersed.

**Vehicle movement & overrun**: Mostly mounting up infantry and moving
everything as far forward as possible to stay away from oncoming Russian
infantry. Huge traffic jam in the pass south of Hill 135. Let's call it
the Pass of Doom.

**Infantry movement & CAT**: almost all mounting up.

Russian:

**Fire determination & resolution**: 3 shots: 1 miss, and two dispersals.

**Vehicle movement & overrun**: Nothing to move.

**Infantry movement & CAT**: Spectacular CAT disperses stack of panzers
in by the Lane of Tears. One or two more infantry units will be able to
CAT next Russian move, might be the end of that stack. But the panzers
served their purpose by soaking up infantry attention.

**Dead pile**: German 10, Russian 11, 1 mine removed.

Game will play out fast now.

## AAR

The first thing to note is that this situation can take quite a while
for the Russian player to set up. For a first time player, budget an
hour for the Russian. It's almost guaranteed analysis paralysis.
The German play will also need some time to set up, probably about 30
minutes *after* the Russians are finished. These set up times decrease
with experience, and with multiple plays of the scenario.

Another thing I'm sure of now, from this game, is that I'm at least very
slightly biasing the game play for some of these solo games. It doesn't feel
overt. It seems to come out as unconscious leaning toward to making one
side or another have small advantages, which add up. A general example
might be making a sub par move, or not firing on an appropriate target.
I won't see these until after the turn finishes.

I think the effect comes from focusing on playing one side really,
really well, while just not thinking about the other side. The Russian
phase in Turn 3 illustrates this perfectly. My focus was on getting the
Germans positioned to clear a lane, with a result of being horribly
exposed.

If I haven't written it elsewhere, I'm not inclined to argue much about
rules, even when I know I'm citably correct. Basically, if someone wants
to dispute a rule or LOS or a movement, I'll geneconcede. I'll do
this both on the player's and my turn, and allow the opponents to
interpret as they see fit, to my disadvantage. When I'm playing myself
in a solitaire game, I'm much more strict.


### Blunders

Russians did not use their position well:

* The 122mm howitzer should bracket, one in Uschas or similar northern
emplacement, the other on the south side of the board in the woods on
Adski Hill (126). With range 20, each can fire on enemy on their half
of the fighting ground, while overlapping to some extent in the middle.
Having the howitzer at 1N6 is relatively ineffective in the early game.
(It may come in to play in the later game.)

* Leaving a hole at 1E3.
* Not reinforcing the crossroad at 1J5 with that spare Recon unit.

German blunders include not getting a CP way forward into cover and
defensible terrain. On the south edge of Board 1, this means Hill 126
east of Adski. That would have been pretty tough, to be sure.

Barrage fire took out a fortification with a mortar. It would have been
better to spend those tubes on a Russian CP.


### Mine and block placement


### Handicapping

Tipping it in the German favor may only require removing one of the
122mm howitzers. These are so important for wearing away at the Germans
that losing even one will have an effect.

One or more of the fortifications could be removed from the OOB, which
would force the Russian player into even more of a defensive posture,
and would change how fields of fire were established. Currently, the
fortifications at DF 50 on top of hills are for the most part
impregnable. A one shot elimination is not guaranteed when they're in
wooded hexes, and in the worst case, with unit firing from below the
hilltop, attack factors would need to total between 100 and 200 to get a
5/6 chance of elimination. CAT atacks just can't muster enough AF
fighting uphill.

What would be better here would be a range of fortification strength
from, say, 20 to 50, where the Russian player could choose which
locations got the strongest fortifications.

On the German side, remove one or more of the light SPAs, either the
StuH 42 or the GW 38(M). These guns don't have a lot of power or range,
but since they're howitzers, they get full AF on soft targets. That's a
big deal and can tip odds a full column right.
