# Situation #8 Game 2

After the first two debacles attempting this scenario, I've set up
identically to the solo game 1 to take another stab at cracking this
puzzle. This time, I'm going to attempt to get around the south end of
the map, with some decoy elements up at the north and in the center area
to try to take some of the heat off the southern push.

We'll see how it goes.

## Set up

As noted above, the Russian set up identically to the first solo game.
The Germans set up as far forward as possibly while maintaining cover.

## Turn 1

And the Germans are off to the races, taking a line along the southern
edge of the map. While this feels a bit "gamey," the scenario, and the
boards, don't provide much of anything else to do. This time, the heavy
guns are coming forward, as it's too hard to get the CP into position.
If I can take out 6 Russian infantry, that will be worth it.

The single direct fire on a Rifle company whiffed, but the close assault
did the trick with a roll of 1 at 2:1 odds. Engineers are awesome that
way.

The Russians don't have a lot of targets at the moment. The ATG took a
shot at the H stack threating the lane of death, but missed. One of the
Russian close assaults failed, the other dispersed a stack of 3 Panthers
with a luck roll of 1. The SU 85s decided to get in on any future action
on the south side, and most of the infantry started moving south as well.

Here's the end of Turn 1:

The Germans, with a little bit of dice rolling luck, may be able to not
lose too terribly badly.

## Turn 2

The Germans now have to figure out exactly where they want to use the
huge guns. This will really matter in the early game. Unless 2 or 3
infantry companies can be knocked out fast, it won't go well for the
Germans. The fire phase got Russian Recon and Rifle companies
elimated, missed on the shot to Hill 126, dispersed a Guards unit.
After fire, Germans are mounting up and moving south. There is just no
way through the north end of the map, what with the swamp and green bars
blocking so much terrain.

Russians apparently only have 1 direct fire target, a Russian rifle
company firing on a German platoon. That's a miss at 1:2 odds roll 5.
That probably would have been better with a close assault, since the Su
85 can move to the top of Hill 126 and be in cover. This is going to
suck for the Germans, really slow them down, and will cost them units as
being able to spot for that hex is 4/6 exposed. Nasty.

Here's the end of Turn 2:

It's dark outside now, hence the mellower yellow of the game photo.

## Turn 3
