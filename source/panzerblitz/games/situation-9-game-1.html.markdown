# Situation #9 Russian mobile Assault on German Blocking Force: Russian Drive on Stalino (1943/08/19)

First time setting this up and playing it.

First glance, looks like a stupendous force mismatch. The Russians have
basically juggernaut strength, and the Germans have very little
mobility. The Russians have so many units, I don't really know what to
do with them.

On the other hand, every unit they don't exit from the west side of the
battlefield is counted as a loss, i.e., equivalent to a German kill.

As usual, the first time I set up a scenario, I get horrible
analysis-paralysis. Sometimes it takes me hours. This is fine when I'm
playing solo, except it's a bit aggravating, because I'd like to get the
game play moving.
