# Situation #9 (game 2)

Set up started on July 10, 2014.

Playing solitaire, one is always subject to bias, both
conscious and unconscious. Finding a way to randomizing
behavior of one side or another always helps. In PanzerBlitz,
the initial set up is often critically important. The terrain
on the map boards limits effective movement for both sides.
With the German defense consisting mostly of infantry and
medium artillery, their defense has to be strong in key
places, without leaving terrain uncovered by fire, or out
of range of fast redeployment with the limited trucks and
wagons.

In this second game, the Russian will attempt to cross the
German line either in the north, middle or south, to be
determined by die roll. To the north and south, narrow but
clear open country allows rapid passage east to west. The
middle boasts the road, which can be traversed in just over
2 turns by trucks. Clearing the road over Hill 132 via
Bednost allows Russian forces extremely rapid movement.

The Germans set up first. Mines and blocks to cut off access at the
extreme bounds, and placed far east to bunch up the Russian
units in the clear terrain on Board 3 as much as possible.
Artillery is split between mortars emplaced to deal fire
immediately, and other units on transport as mobile reserve.
Infantry garrisons Bednost, and provides a "no-pass" line to
the south of Hill 132.

The die dictates: 1-2 Russians go north, 3-4 center, 5-6
south. Roll 3, Russian will take on Hill 132 and attempt
to clear the road through Bednost.
