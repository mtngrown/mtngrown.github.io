# Situation #9 (game 2)

Set up started on July 10, 2014.

Playing solitaire, one is always subject to bias, both
conscious and unconscious. Finding a way to randomizing
behavior of one side or another always helps. In PanzerBlitz,
the initial set up is often critically important. The terrain
on the map boards limits effective movement for both sides.
With the German defense consisting mostly of infantry and
medium artillery, their defense has to be strong in key
places, without leaving terrain uncovered by fire, or out
of range of fast redeployment with the limited trucks and
wagons.

In this second game, the Russian will attempt to cross the
German line either in the north, middle or south, to be
determined by die roll. To the north and south, narrow but
clear open country allows rapid passage east to west. The
middle boasts the road, which can be traversed in just over
2 turns by trucks. Clearing the road over Hill 132 via
Bednost allows Russian forces extremely rapid movement.

The Germans set up first. Mines and blocks to cut off access at the
extreme bounds, and placed far east to bunch up the Russian
units in the clear terrain on Board 3 as much as possible.
Artillery is split between mortars emplaced to deal fire
immediately, and other units on transport as mobile reserve.
Infantry garrisons Bednost, and provides a "no-pass" line to
the south of Hill 132.

The die dictates: 1-2 Russians go north, 3-4 center, 5-6
south. Roll 3, Russian will take on Hill 132 and attempt
to clear the road through Bednost.

## Turn 1

Russians move first, and it's instant analysis-paralysis: how to get as
many units on the board without attracting sure 4:1 kills from German
artillery pounding on trucks. Not much I can do if I want to get
everything on the board in the first turn.

Now that the Russians are all on the board, it's party time for German
artillery. Lucky shot for one of the 75mm howitzers: rolled a 1 for a
truck kill at 2:1 odds. Moved the ATGs into Bednost to protect against
those SU-152s.


Score: Germans 4, Russians 0.

## Turn 2

The Russians are already in a hard place. No matter where they go,
something a-gonna get fired on. However, a bunch of units can be
stacked in Opustchenia, and most of the rest can be tucked away behind
hills, forests, etc. Upshot, 3 trucks remain exposed, which is 3 too
many, but there are only 3 German guns which can reach them, and two
of those are weak, 75mm howitzers.

The Germans seem to be in a fairly good position. Only one ATG taken out
though, the other attacks resulted in dispersals from the 75mm firing on
trucks. Dispersal won't be enough, but it's a start.

Score: Germans 5, Russians 0.

## Turn 3

Russians have no fire targets yet, nothing is technically spotted. Time
to move then. The main goal is to get everything set up to make a rush
on Bednost, and take out the long range guns. At that point, I should
be able to move units with impunity across the map. Not willing to risk
the SU-152s yet, so they continue to position.

Germans are about to lose some units, almost surely, hopefully they can
take another 2 or 3 Russian units with them. And it turns out the
Russians left a stack of trucks where the 120mm mortar could take them
out. Great for the Germans, honest blunder on my part playing the
Russians. Germans otherwise didn't fire so well this turn, only managing
to disperse an SMG company. Close assaults failed. Luckily, I get
another chance at a close assault because the Russians forgot to move
the armor into position to take advantage of the spotting.

Score: Germans 9, Russians 0.

## Turn 4

Russians picked off guns on Hill 129, which will slow down casualties.
Then more positioning, and dispersing some infantry around Bednost. The
armor is swinging west to ensure an easy retreat path by knocking the
howitzer off Hill 135.

Germans are in a boat load of hurt. A couple of dispersals, no units
eliminated this turn.

Score: Germans 9, Russians 2.

## Turn 5


Russians positioning, not taking any units, trying to get into position
to squash Bednost. Time is getting critical.

Germans managing to whiff all direct fire. Managed to disperse some
T-34s, but that is all.

Score: Germans 9, Russians 2.

## Turn 6

Russians move armor around Bednost, just at the half way range of 3
hexes on a range 6 75mm ATG. It's a risk as two ATGs in Bednost could
keep two armor pieces pinned. However, a massive close assault removes
one of the ATGs, hence, worst case for Russians is losing 1 armor.

Germans were only able to disperse, but they have reoccupied Bednost,
which makes it hard for the Russians.

Score: Germans 9, Russians 6.

## Turn 7

The Russians are going to have a really hard time getting off the board.
The Germans are just hard enough to kill to slow everything down, and
have just enough firepower to kill lots and lots of trucks. Given 11, 12
turns, it would be decisive Russian victory no problem at all. As it
stands right now, the Germans have the Russians all bottled up, with
just enough firepower to reliably pick off trucks. I need to play the
scenario again, and next time, make the Germans run all over the map
instead of getting all bottled up.

## Turn 8


## Turn 9


## Turn 10


## AAR

For both these games, I've been assuming that the entire Russian force
must enter the east edge of Board 3 on Turn 1. That is, all the Russian
units must enter on Turn 1, none may be left off the board for entering
at a later time. Moreover, I've been assuming the best bet is to bring
the Russians up the road as a column.

It might be worthwhile to play this scenario having the Russians come in
as a front across the east edge of the map. This would let many units
get into cover much quicker.


### Variations

It might be interesting to allow the Russians to enter Board 3 whenever
they want. On the one hand, it would allow the Russian armor to
eliminate at least some of the German artillery before the unarmored
Russian column continues to advance. On the other hand, it puts the
Russians that much further behind on getting units off the board by the
end of Turn 10.


### Blunders

* Russians should have held the trucks back a couple of turns until
either the German 75mms were cleared, or the trucks could fund cover
from them. This cost several units.

* Tracks could be used to get guards units onto the German 75mm in two
turns, which would remove a pesky source of annoyance as those guns keep
picking off trucks. However, the guards were all deployed on trucks.

* Losing too many trucks to Germans, some of these were just blunders
from leaving stacks in the clear. The whole point of stacking is to get
all the vehicles behind cover.
