# Balkas - the gullies in PanzerBlitz


PanzerBlitz map boards feature gullies with odd properties. These
gullies are easy to get into (1 movement point), but difficult to exit
(5 movement points for trucks, 3 for all other vehicles).

Why is this? What are these gullies anyway?


## Some Quaternary geomorphology

Looks like a pretty good reference:

## Pictures!

Enough talk, let's take a look some balkas "in the field."
