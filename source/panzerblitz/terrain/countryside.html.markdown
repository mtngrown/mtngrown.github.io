# PanzerBlitz country - The Eastern Front

PanzerBlitz situations simulate tactical battles in what is now
Belarous, Ukraine and Russia proper.

The three geomorphic map boards make a sincere attempt to simulate the
common elements of terrain over approximately one million square miles.

On one hand, this seems ludicrous. On the other hand, the steppe country
of Ukraine and Russia, and the rolling hills and marshes of Belarus, are
remarkably uniform in topography. That is to say, mostly flat with low
and occassionally rolling hills.

So the mapboards do a pretty good job overall.


From Zhukov:

One can almost imagine looking down on Opustochenia from the east side of Hill
132.
