### PanzerBlitz links

Here are a few of the best links about PanzerBlitz available on the web.

* [Imaginative
  Strategist](http://www.imaginative-strategist.layfigures.com/),
often referred to as "ImStrat" has an incredible collection of articles,
counters, maps and other material related to PanzerBlitz, Panzer Leader
and the Arab Israeli games. Seriously, ImStrat is worth hours of time.

* [Greg's PanzerBlitz Site](http://gregpanzerblitz.com/) is another
outstanding resource, also worth hours of reading.

* [ConSim World Forum](http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.ee6d608)
  appears to be where a number of current PanzerBlitz players can be
found. The forum is relatively relaxed and low traffic, but there is a
lot of information available.

There are several more outstanding links which will be added in the
future, and if you, the reader, find one of your favorite sites missing,
please issue a [pull request](https://github.com/mtngrown/consim/pulls)
with the relevant addition.
