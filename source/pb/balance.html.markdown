# Balance in PanzerBlitz Situations

What makes for a balanced game?

That's a good question, and most players would probably agree on
something like this:

*A "balanced" game is one where each player has a equal chance of
winning based on skill.*

This works in games where chance is involved because "playing the odds"
is also a matter of skill, and to the extent of chance's influence,
skill will expose the better player over a number of games.

In PanzerBlitz, each side is given an order of battle and victory
conditions, and a limited number of turns to achieve victory.

So how is an equal chance of winning determined?

It stands to reason that changing either the order of battle (OOB) or the
victory conditions will change the balance of the situation. In some
cases, increasing or decreasing the number of turns may also affect the
victory conditions.

In some situations, it feels like initial setup or very early game play
has an enormous influence on the outcome, such that if the opposing
player can exploit a weakness early on, the game may tip in that
player's favor.

In other words, some scenarios appear highly imbalanced, favoring one
side or another within the number of turns given in the situation. But
this imbalance may be a result of superior early positioning of that
side. Should the "stronger" side deploy poorly, the game might well swing
radically to the "weaker" side's favor.



## Situation #1

Favors Germans

### Rebalancing

Add tanks to Russians, remove mines/blocks from Germans, take away one
or both 88 mm from German, replace with 76 mm. Remove one fortification
from German, forcing a command post in the clear. Increase the turn
length to 15 to allow Russians to optimize positioning.

The difficulty rebalancing this situation is that a slight advantage to
the Russians could drastically affect the results. Make a fortification
a little too easy to crack, and the Russians may destroy two.

### Winning strategy

The Russians *must* find a way to destroy at least one command post.
This requires getting into position to pound on a fortification for
several turns, while taking 88 mm fire at point blank.

Positioning is everything for the Germans, as they are for the most
part, immobile.

## Situation #2

Favors Russians, heavily. The Russian infantry does not move fast, but
it's very difficult to completely stop. There is so much cover requiring
spotting, and any unit getting close enough to destroy Russian infantry
companies puts itself at serious risk of dangerous close assault.
Nevertheless, there are a lot of options for rebalancing Situation #2.

### Rebalancing

Several easy modifications allow a much better balanced scenario. Here
are a few ideas.

* Add infantry or armor to German's forces.
* Use optional indirect fire rules with an added H class weapon for Germans.
* Reduce Russian infantry strength by 2 or more companies.

### Winning strategy

For the Germans, the winning strategy is getting as far forward as fast
as possible, and force the Russians to fight for every hex. There is no
way to stop the Russian onslaught. The best the Germans can do is
attempt to slow it down while the turn clock ticks.

For the Russians, just the opposite: it's imperative to get enough
infantry as far south as possible as early as possible so that the
advance doesn't get bogged assaulting the German blocking forces.

### Victory conditions

* Require Russians to advance further for each victory condition, say 9 or
  10 hexes for marginal victory. Alternatively, shorten the turn limit
  by one or two moves, forcing the Russians to make riskier moves.
  Either of these modifications are the easiest to implement. 
* Rewrite victory conditions as point-based, accounting for units destroyed,
  Russian units in position, and units disabled on last turn. This is
  the most complex modification, but done correctly, could provide a lot
  of insight into the scenario mechanics.

## Situation #3

Situation #3 is a "breakthrough-type" scenario, where the Germans have
to clear a 3-hex wide line through the Russian defense.

Favors Russians, apparently very strongly as the PzKw III Gs cannot
muster enough firepower to affect Russian infantry, and there isn't
enough German infantry to push back. Hence, all the Russian need to do
to win is stack infantry with artillery in wooded or town hexes, and the
Germans will be lucky to dislodge even one.

### Rebalancing

Several things could be done, either by reducing Russian OOB
or increasing German OOB:

For the Russian, one of the following would probably work:

* Remove Russian infantry units, either both Guards, or both SMG, or one
  each Guard or SMG, or 3 rifle companies. The guard units are
  impossible to dislodge in this scenario, and the SMG units have a
  *lot* of firepower (AF 8).
* Remove one truck, or 3 wagons from the OOB. Because the Russians do
  not know where the Germans will try and break through, they need to
  start the game with some poweful units mounted and ready to move to
  wherever the Germans are going. Remove the wheels, and the infantry
  isn't going anywhere fast.
* Remove one ATG and one howitzer or mortar. This will require the
  infantry to fill in the gaps which would otherwise be covered by
  these units.

For the German player, try:

* Add another PzKw III G and 3 more platoons of infantry.
* Add add an engineer unit to the German's OOB (check to see if
  this is historically viable). Given the Germans deployed
  engineer units, having one in the inevitable close assaults on
  the Russian infantry might really help even up the scenario.
* Have reinforcements enter Board 2 on Turn 3 (or 4 or 5, whatever
  produces the best result). These might be the above-mentioned
  PzKw III G units, or could be PzKw III D, or PzKw II. If infantry
  are introduced for reinforcement, have them enter dismounted, forcing
  the German player to detail a few trucks or tracks to get them into
  battle. A side effect of this will be to expose any German ATG or
  mortar units which are emplaced far forward.
* Add two more 82 mm mortars. (Unfortunately for this 1941 scenario,
  the 122 mm mortar would not be introduced until 1942.) These tiny
  units can reach way, way out and really hurt Russian transport units.

Alternatively, Alan Arvold offers a historically accurate German OOB
featuring 14 instead of 5 AFVs. Under the original specification for
this situation, these extra armor units should help balance the battle.

### Winning strategy

For the Russians, starting the game with everything possible already
mounted lets most mounted units get into play by Turn 3. It's really
important for the Russians to maintain their line. If too many units are
pulled off the defensive line and trucked over to the where the Germans
are attempting to penetrate, the risk is losing fire coverage.

The Germans need to destroy as much transport as possible as early
as possible, before the Russians get the infantry into position to
push. While hunting down transport, the Germans also need to locate
and destroy as many Russian long range guns and mortars.

Also, the Germans need to find a position which holds a clear
line in their rear, while blocking the Russians. Given the defensive
strength and offensive weakness of the Russian infantry, while the
Russians can't be easily dislodged, neither can they easily destroy a
stack of German units in a favorable position.

### Victory conditions

Situation #3 is a pretty good scenario in one respect: two good players ought
to be able to produce a draw. The Germans, if they can destroy enough
H and M, force the Russian infantry to move, which may leave holes in
their line elsewhere on the map. However, if they don't move that 
infantry, the Russians risk a German breakthrough.

Hence, a likely outcome is the Russian leaving one or more small holes
(1 or 2 hexes uncovered by fire) in their line while denying the
Germans a 3 hex strip of cleared corridor. That is, a draw.

For the original OOB, victory conditions could be adjusted to the
following:

* Marginal German victory: break the Russians defensive line
  in one or more hexes anywhere on the map.
* Tactical German victory: achieve 3 hex corridor with Russian line 
  intact everywhere else.
* Decisive German victory: achieve 3 hex corridor and break the Russian
  line in one or more hexes elsehwere.

* Marginal Russian victory: hold the line intact while denying the
  German corridor and losing more than 10 units.
* Tactical Russian victory: deny Germans, hold the line intact, lose
  more than 5 but less than 10 units.
* Decisive Russian victory: hold the line, deny the Germans, lose 5 or
  less units.

These conditions are fair because the Russian player, with diligence,
can maintain the line by simply positioning units to compensate every
turn. If the Russian player does not pay attention to units not in the
action, the player may not notice when the line breaks over a hex in
one or more places.

As a variant, the Russians could add the number of German units
destroyed. Points could be subtracted for each hex found uncovered by
fire at the end of the game. (This should be a very expensive option for
the Russians.)

For yet another variant, "covered by fire" could be defined as hexes
being covered by artillery fire only, or by artillery fire and close
assault range of infantry. This removes the ranged fire of the Russian
infantry, making it harder for to cover the line, and harder to move
infantry around with without adverse consequences.

Going further, the strength of line might be considered by requiring a
certain minimum number of attack factors be brought to bear on each hex.

For a rebalanced scenario, one which a German player might win, the
marginal German victory could be establishing a 3 hex corridor, while
tactical and decisive victories could be 4 to 6 hex corridor, and 7 hex
corridor, respectively.

Also, swamps could count against cleared hexes, and any corridor
incorporating hexes on the edge of the board might have to be one or two
hexes wider to acheive victory.



### Variations

Try the following:

* Rearrange the map boards in order and aspect, then replay the scenario
  and see how it changes.
* Use the same OOB with 3 boards selected at random from the ImStrat
  boards.

## Situation #4

(On hold while acquiring a long table.)

From Avalon Hill's "The General" magazine (v. 11, #6, p. 14) in an article
entitled "The Professional Russian," Situation #4
is described as hopelessly tilted to the Russians. On the other hand, 
The General published a Series Replay (v. 12, #2, p. 20) for Situation #4
which resulted in a clear draw. The article further asserted the odds
were 50% Russian win, 25% German win, 25% draw.

Let's play it and see.

### Variations

The playing boards for Situation #4 link end-to-end. Finding a table
which is close to six feet long might be difficult for many people. I
don't have one myself. One way to mitigate this is play the scenario on
just Boards 2 and 3. Alternatively, the ends of Boards 2 and 1 can be
folded under resulting in half boards. This way, it's possible to follow
the action across the boards using just the parts needed.

## Situation #5

The Russians established a bridgehead at Lutezh in early 1943, and
Situation #5 simulates a German reconnaissance in force against the
Russian bridgehead. Lutezh is 15-20 kilometers north of Kiev on the
Dnieper River, probably on the west bank of the river as everything east
of Lutezh for several kilometers is now flooded by the Kiev Reservoir.


### Rebalancing

Short answer: Remove one or two rifle companies, one or two artillery
batteries and a couple of wagons or trucks from the Russian OOB.
Frankly, the Russians didn't need to do much more than position rifle
companies to deny ground to the Germans, which would bog down into
ineffective direct fire on the Russians, and go-for-broke close assaults
on the Germans. Also, consider removing one or more blocks or mines from
Russian OOB.

Conversely, to the German OOB, add 2-3 infantry platoons, or 1-2
engineer units to help with removing mines and getting close assault
benefits.

### Winning strategy

As written, if the Germans don't have all candidate units off the east
side of Board 2 by the end of Turn 5 (Turn 4, really), they might as
well concede. By the time they get back on the board on Turn 8, it's
almost impossible to get back through the Russian line.

The Germans may want to keep the Wespes way in the rear, and focus on
using the halftracks and CPs to spot Russian units.

The Russians don't even need to fight that much, just set up the mines
and blocks, and shove rifle companies everywhere else. This practically
guarantees the Germans will get bogged down slugging it out with Russian
infantry.

Smart players will work out all the routes across Board 1 in advance.
The Germans need to know the fastest terrain for crossing, and the
Russian need to deny that fast terrain.


### Victory conditions

The easiest way to rebalance is probably adjust the victory conditions:

* Require Germans to leave play for 1 or 2 turns instead of 3.
* Have the victory condition be finding cover on Board 3 instead of
  exiting. Or just having enough units on Board 3 after the Russians
  on Turn 12.
* Extend the game a couple more turns, from 12 to say, 15 turns. This
  would not necessarily make it "easier" for the Germans to win, but it
  might make it possible.

In Summer 1944, after breaking out of the bocage and moving into open
country, U.S. tank units who were engaged at range from German defensive
positions sometimes took 50% casualties before spotting where the fire
was coming from.[40 Tank Tactics from Normandy to Lorraine]

## Playing to a draw

The original rules do not discuss fighting to a draw, but adding a
"draw" outcome might help balance situations. With tiered victory
conditions, when both sides achieve the same victory condition, that's a
draw.
