# Situation #1  Fortified command post 

*Don't mess with my acht acht*


Original rules.

Maybe use Vassal for screenshots.


Do a turn by turn sequence. This can be scripted up front.

## Turn 1

###Russian

Russians come in on 2-A-3 road hex. German is in fortified command post
resulting in a huge Russian pileup at the end up the ridge containg Hill
129.

### German

## Turn 4

Slope to hilltop full strength if adjacent hexes.

Cavalry may only move 1 hex for a close assault.



## Conclusions

Situation #1 provides opportunity for micro-scenarios involving any of
the three command posts, but especially that situated on Hill 129.

### Mine and block placement

I've been placing mines and blocks on the approaches, but they may serve
better surrounding command posts. The Russians can bypass the approaches
at the cost of a turn or two of movement, but have to deal with mines
and block around the command posts the whole game,  probably making it
even harder to win.

### Handicapping

When the Germans are dug in really well, it's very hard for the Russians
to get more than a marginal victory. One way way to handicap would be to
give the Russians one or two more T-34c tanks.

Rounding makes a huge difference in this game. From here on out I'm
going to round units individually and sum all fractions before the final
rounding. I'm thinking about extending the CRT to handle 3/2 and 2/3
cases, possibly with 2 d6. This will require more paper and pencil work
for combat resolution.
