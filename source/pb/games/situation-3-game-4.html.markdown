# Situation 3 - Game 4

Feb. 9, 2014 at Endgame

Al S. played Russian against my German. I used the original scenario OOB.

I won this one, barely:

* Russian did not establish and defend long range battery fields of
  fire.
* Russian did not effectively transport infantry.
* German was effective in moving rapidly into a blocking position to
  maintain clear hexes on Board 1 south of Adski. The Russian was unable
to dislodge this line and push back. Terrain helped prevent Russian from
flanking.
