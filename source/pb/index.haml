%h3 Situation #3

Played this first with Al S, then a solo game.

I've read elsewhere that this is one of the most unbalanced
scenarios in the original game, and while it's true the that
it's a very tough win for the Germans, if the Russians aren't
careful, they won't meet their victory conditions either.
