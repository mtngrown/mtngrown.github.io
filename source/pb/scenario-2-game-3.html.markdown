S2G3 - PanzerBlitz

Germans come in on south side of east-most board this game.

Also, I figured out that the so-called "panzerbush" rule is about the
only way artillery retains any effectiveness at all.

I do not agree with how reverse slopes are managed with respect to line
of site from hill tops. Feels counterintuitive to me.

## Turns 1-3

Massive positioning exercise. As usual.

## Turn 4

Russian H takes a pot shot at 1-3 on a PzKpfw (G942) and rolls a 1,
disperse! Russians having amazing rolls. Actually, this was a blunder,
the H should have had its attack factor halved due to panzer being on a
slope.

## Turn 5

The Germans, attacking at 3-1, roll a 6. This has been happening over
and over and over again on this series of games.

And the Russians, again, roll a 1 on a 1-3 attack

## AAR


This was really bad on the dice for the Germans. The Russians managed to
hit every single time with at least a disperse, while the Germans only
managed 4-1 action. Through Turn 8, they whiffed everything. It's really
bad as it makes the German player too cautious.

I bagged it on Turn 10 when the Germans rolled another 6 on 3-1 odds
againts the heavy mortar lodged...

Blunder!

The attacks on turns need to be double AF! I totally forgot!

This may well have changed the game to a draw, as the Russians did not
qute get to hex line L, and the Germans almost surely would have gained
more kills. If the 120 mm mortar  (R91)  had been taken out by Turn 8,
this game would have been much closer. Likewise, had the dice been a bit
more neutral, this would have been closer to a draw.

So, marginal victory to Russians.


### Blunders

* Not accounting for slope and mistakenly allowing the Russian to
  disperse a panzer for a turn. This was costly for the Germans.

### To do

Gin up some firefights.
