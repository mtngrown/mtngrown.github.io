## PanzerBlitz solitaire play

PanzerBlitz is surprisingly easy to play solitaire, but can be surprisingly difficult
to "win." It can also be surprisingly fun. Here are a few guidelines:


The benefits of playing solitaire are numerous:

1. Clock time is relatively unimportant. Playing through a situation can
   take as much or as little time as you desire. Given you have a place
   where the game won't be disturbed, playing out a game over several
   days might make the difference between playing or not playing.
2. It's easy to play through the same situation multiple times,
   considering different strategies and tactics.
3. When clock time is unimportant, each turn can be considered in
   detail. There is time to takes notes, and time to read through the
   rules very carefully.
4. Conversely, games can be run with a timer, where each turn is knocked
   out in, say, six to ten minutes. Playing fast will expose blunders in
   playing very quickly.
5. Getting familiar with situations at one's leisure really helps game
   play when you have an opponent. The first time setting up a situation
   is the hardest and takes the longest.



### How to balance solitaire play

Balancing play in solitaire games is difficult as a tendency to favor
one side or another always seems to lurk just below the level of
conscious thought.

* Use the 1-finger rule to speed up game play and reduce favoritism.
  The notion is that once a unit is moved, and the fingers which moved
  the unit lift, it's done. No going back and revisiting a move, what's
  done is done. (This would also work to speed up game play with two
  players.)

* Randomize smartly. For example suppose the situation called for the Germans
  to set up first (e.g., Situation #1), and the Russians to enter on any side of
  the board. Instead of choosing in advance which board the Russians enter on,
  let the dice choose. That way, the "Germans" will have to cover all sides.
  Conversely, suppose the Russians set up first as in Situation #3. Where should the
  Germans attempt to punch through? Throw the dice!


### Guidelines for Situations

1. **Situation #1** The Russians can enter from any side, which is
   problematic when playing solitaire. To randomize, roll a d4
   (or d8) and count from North edge of board as 1, east as 2, etc.
   If rolling a d6, just ignore rolls of 5 or 6 and re-roll until
   1-4 is obtained.

   Once a first game is determined, given an identical German
   deployment, further games can have Russians advancing from each
   side subsequently.
  
1. **Situation #2** Roll d6 to choose which board to enter on. It really
   doesn't make a lot of difference in this situation.

1. **Situation #3** Roll d6 to determine which board the Germans will
   attempt to drive a corridor through. This
   ensures that the Russians won't anticipate the German push. Note that
   a Russian strategy of having units mounted at the beginning of the
   game practically dictates these units are located on Board 2. If the
   German player decides to feint, the die should determine to which
   side: even east, west odd.
1. **Situation #4** on hold while finding a long table for playing.
1. **Situation #5** after one play, doesn't present any obvious
   randomizations. Perhaps future solitaire games will expose
   appropriate chance elements.

There are surely more interesting and innovative ways to create
solitaire playability, ideas and pointers welcome.
