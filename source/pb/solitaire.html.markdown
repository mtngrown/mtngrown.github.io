## PanzerBlitz solitaire play

PanzerBlitz is surprisingly easy to play solitaire, but can be surprisingly difficult
to "win." It can also be surprisingly fun. Here are a few guidelines:


The benefits of playing solitaire are numerous:

1. Clock time is relatively unimportant. Playing through a situation can
   take as much or as little time as you desire. Given you have a place
   where the game won't be disturbed, playing out a game over several
   days might make the difference between playing or not playing.
2. It's easy to play through the same situation multiple times,
   considering different strategies and tactics.
3. When clock time is unimportant, each turn can be considered in
   detail. There is time to takes notes, and time to read through the
   rules very carefully.
4. Conversely, games can be run with a timer, where each turn is knocked
   out in, say, six to ten minutes. Playing fast will expose blunders in
   playing very quickly.

### How to balance play

Balancing play in solitaire games is difficult as a tendency to favor
one side or another always seems to lurk just below the level of
conscious thought.

* Use the 1-finger rule to speed up game play and reduce favoritism.
  The notion is that once a unit is moved, and the fingers which moved
  the unit lift, it's done. No going back and revisiting a move, what's
  done is done. (This would also work to speed up game play with two
  players.)

* Randomize smartly. For example suppose the situation called for the Germans
  to set up first (e.g., Situation #1), and the Russians to enter on any side of
  the board. Instead of choosing in advance which board the Russians enter on,
  let the dice choose. That way, the "Germans" will have to cover all sides.
  Conversely, suppose the Russians set up first as in Situation #3. Where should the
  Germans attempt to puunch through? Throw the dice!
