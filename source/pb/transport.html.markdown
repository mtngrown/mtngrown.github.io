# Transporting units

Getting infantry and artillery units into effective combat requires transport.

## Initial position

![alt text][initial]

We want to take the truck into Opustoschenia to pick up Russian rifle
company 1001 and transport it to Hill 107. Note: this is not to advocate
parking infantry on a hill; the hill provides an easy landmark for
illustrating the game mechanics of transport.

Hill 107 is 7 hexes from 1001's current location. Moving there on its
own would take more than half the game. Getting there by truck puts 1001
into fighting position in 3 moves.

## Turn 1 movement

The first move colocates the truck and the rifle company.

----

## Turn 2 movement

![alt text][turn_2]

The second move loads the rifle company for transport.

----

## Turn 3 movement

![alt text][turn_3]

The third move transports the rifle company to Hill 107 moving 6 hexes
up the road for cost 1/2 each hex, 1 hex off road for cost 2, 1 hex up
the hill for cost 4 and lastly 1 hex clear on Hill 107 for cost 2. Total
movement cost 11.

PanzerBlitz rules allow unloading in the same turn as transport,
provided stacking rules are observed. Unloading is designated by
stacking the rifle company counter on the truck counter. The rifle
company is now free to fight.

The transporting unit is also free
to move away if it has enough movement points to make a move. In this
case, the trucks need 4 movement points to get down the hill. Since
stacking limitations are observed, we'll move the trucks another turn.

In the meantime, we might leave the trucks right where they are to
conveniently load up the rifle company and move again in the future.
