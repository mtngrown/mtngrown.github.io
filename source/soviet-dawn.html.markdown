# Soviet Dawn

An intermittent log of plays.

## June 1, 2014

1. Picked up tank on a reorg, played tanks against Baltic. This was the
   first time I've used the reorg table. Got half way
   through Twilight and a few cards into Night. A roll for political
   dissent put me into Political Collapse, game over!

   I forgot to score this defeat.
