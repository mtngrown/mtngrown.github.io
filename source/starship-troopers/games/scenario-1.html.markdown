# Scenario #1

## Game 1

May 4, 2013


S1G1 - Starship Troopers

SST is a very curious game base on the book of the same name by Robert
A. Heinlein.

First impressions: the game is antiquated in appearance. The graphics
are beyond laughable, almost embarrassing, even compared to standards of
the day. The counters are 1/2", really small, and the lettering even
smaller. For example, the most import information on the Terran counters
is, arguably, the unit designator. Each Terran "marauder" counter
represents an individual marine, but it's really difficult to read which
marine is which from the counter, The board is boring. My copy suffers
from nearly misprinted counter art, and one of the map boards is out of
alignment.

Then why the interest?

Let's count the reasons:

1. The game is based on fictional history, an account of a war which
   never happened, and in this universe, never will.

2. SST is loaded with innovative mechanics to simulate highly asymmetric
   forces and fog of war.

3. Vast numbers were printed, so the game is readily available and
   inexpensive in the aftermarket.

4. Probably more.


### Setting up

Having absolutely no idea what I was doing, I just plopped down all the
pieces for the Skinnies forces clustered around the city and spaceport,
with the Skinnie combat forces deployed out front.  I did not use the
strong points at all.

### Turn 1

Terrans roared in from the bottom of the board.

Skinnies moved to reposition in front of Terrans.

### Turn 2

Marines, straight up the middle.

Skinnies, sweeping east to intercept marines.

### Turns 3, 4, 5

I don't recall the exact sequence of events here, so combining
description of these turns.

Marines, scout starts occupying facilities, picked the water facility by
luck.

Skinnies not sure what to do, Marines starting to move through the
defensive line.

Marines start hopping on to facilities, Skinnies start to engage.

Over the course of these turns, the marines eliminate a defender and
disrupt two others. In return, the defenders score a HVY on one of the
marines.

### Turn 6

By this time, I was losing track of whose turnwas whose, the Terrans
were stomping the defense decisively, and there did not seem to be any
point in continuing. So I called the game.


### AAR

I called the game around the half way point when it became clear I had
absolutely no idea how to play the Skinnies defense. In fact, it seemed
hopelessly out of balance to me, in favor of the Terrans.

Then I went on to BGG to look up some stratgey, and sure enough, I was
definitely doing it wrong.

#### Blunders

Among many, one in particular: Critical Facilities have to be occupied
for a full turn to be claimed by Marines. Since the defensive forces
were so badly deployed, this blunder did not change the outcome.

## Game 2

### Setup

The Aliens set up first:

{:.center}
![Starship Troopers Scenario 1](/images/st_s1_g2_setup.jpg)

The strong points are 8 hexes apart along roads, and the critical
facilities are within a single  move of a strong point or city.
The weaker alien units should be able to move between strong
points and critical facilities with ease.

### Turn 1

Turn 1 is easy, only the Terrans really need to move.

### Turn 2

Same with Turn 2, no reason to have Aliens move, let
the Terrans eat up the clock.

### Turn 3

The scout is going ahead of the pack of MI units to attempt
to determine which installations are critical and which are
decoys. The Humanoids can't cover them all.


Humanoid in strong points close to the city start moving
towards the critical facilities on the back side of the city,
which don't have any support close by.

There's going to be a fight.

### Turn 4

Terrans continue to move in.

Humanoids will try to box in the Terrans behind the city.



### Turn 5

Terrans now uncovered communications facility. Scout and leader
moving east and north, main MI force moving NNW and will split
next turn.

Humanoids move to occupy critical facilities, to deny automatic
destruction by Terrans.

### Turn 6

Terrans uncover two more critical facilities, one decoy. One of the
facilities is guarded by workers.

Humanoids move to block automatic facility destruction.

Score: Terrans 1, Humanoids 46.

### Turn 7

Terrans are starting to feel the pressure, time to get
going on these facilities.


Score: Terrans 8-1, Humanoids 39.

### Turn 8

Terrans need to move a bit faster here. Took out a warrior
humanoid.

Humanoid going to stuns to drag out the clock. All misses.

Score: Terrans 10-2, Humanoids 39.

### Turn 9

Terrans eliminated 1 worker, disrupted warrior (roll 1).
Start to move east to gain some traction on the remaining
facilities.

Humanoids have a single move which matters, getting
warriors on to the road.

Score: Terrans 15-3, Humanoids 34.

### Turn 10

Terrans now after the last facilities, uncovered the
water tower. Eliminated a warrior, facility from preceding
turn eliminated.

Humanoids got a couple of stuns! Take those battlesuits out
of action!

Score: Terrans 22-3, Humanoids 29.

### Turn 11

Eliminated 1 more warrior. Probably should have gone for
the gusto, would have been a win or lose roll.

Humanoids looking for more stuns. Nope. Units
moving in from the west are not going to make it in
time to block the MI from taking out the water tower.

Score: Terrans 23-3, Humanoids 29.

### Turn 12

Terrans eliminate all forces on water tower.

Humanoids can save the day: depending on how
one reads the city rules, the humanoids win
by putting a warrior on the water tower from
the other facility. It's just not clear...

Actually, the rules are clear: the movement
example shows MI units paying 3 to get into a
city hex, which implies 1/2 for a Humanoid
to enter under the same conditions.

Score: Terrans 25-3, Humanoids 29.

### AAR

Final score: Humanoids 29, Terrans 25.

I think this could be pretty hard to win as the Terrans,
against someone who really has it together playing the
Humanoids.

One way to handicap would be reduce the number of decoys,
or workers or both.

Cool game. Glad I took the time to play another session.

#### Blunders

* Humanoids should have left a couple of strong points empty and
deployed in the city.
* Humanoids should deploy critical facilities within two moves
to help deny MI destruction.
* Humainoids not moving workers around fast enough for use as blocking
forces.
* Humanoids should have sacrificed unit on last comm facility
to ensure forces remained on water tower. This cost the game.
