            <h2 id="game-1">Game 1</h2>
            
            <p>May 4, 2013</p>
            
            <p>S1G1 - Starship Troopers</p>
            
            <p>SST is a very curious game base on the book of the same name by Robert
            A. Heinlein.</p>
            
            <p>First impressions: the game is antiquated in appearance. The graphics
            are beyond laughable, almost embarrassing, even compared to standards of
            the day. The counters are 1/2", really small, and the lettering even
            smaller. For example, the most import information on the Terran counters
            is, arguably, the unit designator. Each Terran "marauder" counter
            represents an individual marine, but it's really difficult to read which
            marine is which from the counter, The board is boring. My copy suffers
            from nearly misprinted counter art, and one of the map boards is out of
            alignment.</p>
            
            <p>Then why the interest?</p>
            
            <p>Let's count the reasons:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>The game is based on fictional history, an account of a war which
            never happened, and in this universe, never will.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>SST is loaded with innovative mechanics to simulate highly asymmetric
            forces and fog of war.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Vast numbers were printed, so the game is readily available and
            inexpensive in the aftermarket.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Probably more.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3 id="setting-up">Setting up</h3>
            
            <p>Having absolutely no idea what I was doing, I just plopped down all the
            pieces for the Skinnies forces clustered around the city and spaceport,
            with the Skinnie combat forces deployed out front.  I did not use the
            strong points at all.</p>
            
            <h3 id="turn-1">Turn 1</h3>
            
            <p>Terrans roared in from the bottom of the board.</p>
            
            <p>Skinnies moved to reposition in front of Terrans.</p>
            
            <h3 id="turn-2">Turn 2</h3>
            
            <p>Marines, straight up the middle.</p>
            
            <p>Skinnies, sweeping east to intercept marines.</p>
            
            <h3 id="turns-3-4-5">Turns 3, 4, 5</h3>
            
            <p>I don't recall the exact sequence of events here, so combining
            description of these turns.</p>
            
            <p>Marines, scout starts occupying facilities, picked the water facility by
            luck.</p>
            
            <p>Skinnies not sure what to do, Marines starting to move through the
            defensive line.</p>
            
            <p>Marines start hopping on to facilities, Skinnies start to engage.</p>
            
            <p>Over the course of these turns, the marines eliminate a defender and
            disrupt two others. In return, the defenders score a HVY on one of the
            marines.</p>
            
            <h3 id="turn-6">Turn 6</h3>
            
            <p>By this time, I was losing track of whose turnwas whose, the Terrans
            were stomping the defense decisively, and there did not seem to be any
            point in continuing. So I called the game.</p>
            
            <h3 id="aar">AAR</h3>
            
            <p>I called the game around the half way point when it became clear I had
            absolutely no idea how to play the Skinnies defense. In fact, it seemed
            hopelessly out of balance to me, in favor of the Terrans.</p>
            
            <p>Then I went on to BGG to look up some stratgey, and sure enough, I was
            definitely doing it wrong.</p>
            
            <h4 id="blunders">Blunders</h4>
            
            <p>Among many, one in particular: Critical Facilities have to be occupied
            for a full turn to be claimed by Marines. Since the defensive forces
            were so badly deployed, this blunder did not change the outcome.</p>
            
            <h2 id="game-2">Game 2</h2>
            
            <h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
            
            <p>The Aliens set up first:</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img alt="Starship Troopers Scenario 1" src="/images/st_s1_g2_setup.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>The strong points are 8 hexes apart along roads, and the critical
            facilities are within a single  move of a strong point or city.
            The weaker alien units should be able to move between strong
            points and critical facilities with ease.</p>
            
            <h3 id="turn-1-1">Turn 1</h3>
            
            <p>Turn 1 is easy, only the Terrans really need to move.</p>
            
            <h3 id="turn-2-1">Turn 2</h3>
            
            <p>Same with Turn 2, no reason to have Aliens move, let
            the Terrans eat up the clock.</p>
            
            <h3 id="turn-3">Turn 3</h3>

            the other facility. It's just not clear…</p>
            
            <p>Actually, the rules are clear: the movement
            example shows MI units paying 3 to get into a
            city hex, which implies 1/2 for a Humanoid
            to enter under the same conditions.</p>

            <p>I think this could be pretty hard to win as the Terrans,
            against someone who really has it together playing the
            Humanoids.</p>
            
            <p>One way to handicap would be reduce the number of decoys,
            or workers or both.</p>
            
            <p>Cool game. Glad I took the time to play another session.</p>

              <p>Avalon Hill's PanzerBlitz was a successor to a game called
              "Tactical Game 3," which was never developed for market. The story can
              be found on related web sites. What's important here is that the game
              does have a long and successful history, ultimately selling hundreds
              of thousands of copies.</p>
              <h3 id="panzerblitz-links">PanzerBlitz links</h3>
              
              <p>Here are a few of the best links about PanzerBlitz available on the web.</p>

              Strategist</a>,
              often referred to as "ImStrat" has an incredible collection of articles,
              counters, maps and other material related to PanzerBlitz, Panzer Leader
              and the Arab Israeli games. Seriously, ImStrat is worth hours of time.</p>

                <li>
                  <p><a href="http://gregpanzerblitz.com/">Greg's PanzerBlitz Site</a> is another
              outstanding resource, also worth hours of reading.</p>

              appears to be where a number of current PanzerBlitz players can be
              found. The forum is relatively relaxed and low traffic, but there is a
              lot of information available.</p>
